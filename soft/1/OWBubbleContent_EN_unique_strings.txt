"I didn't really try\nbecause no women\nwere watching"!
*sigh*
A Food Fight, huh?\nSounds interesting.
A food fight with a\ngourmet critic?\nSounds boring.
A fortune teller?\nHmm...
A lot of people got\nhurt by the Subway\nSlammer, huh?
A lot of students\nare skipping school\nthese days.
A new restaurant's\nopening soon. I\nwanna try it.
A one-year wait for\na reservation?\nUnbelievable.
Afternoon classes\nare such a drag.
Ah, right, right...
Ah... I'm craving\nChinese food...
Ah... I'm tired...
Ahh... Sooo full...
All he did was shove\npeople. How is that\nnewsworthy?
Almost home! Snacks\nand a cold beer are\nwaiting for me!
An accident? I hope\neveryone's okay...
Apparently, he once\nheard a loud bang\nand fainted.
Arai-san and\nNoge-san make quite\na pair, huh?
Arai-san's been\nhanging out with\nboys a lot...
Aren't there any\npolice officers at\nthe station?
As awful as Miyazawa\nwas, food reviews do\ncome in handy.
Avoid anywhere\nMiyazawa recommends\nlike the plague.
Booored.
Can you believe what\nthey sell in vending\nmachines now?
Chinese food really\nis the best\nafter all.
Choosing is a\nhassle. Let's just\npick any place.
Class is\ntoo hard.
Come on, I gotta win\nsomeday... This is\nso frustrating!
Damn... I had a\nshift today,\ndidn't I?
Did that really\nwarrant a special\nnews report?
Did you hear that?
Did you hear? The\nguy who slammed into\nyou was caught.
Did you read it?\nThe article.
Didn't Takeyuki\nKiuchi use to coach\nlittle league?
Didn't the people\nwho got shoved\nreport it?
Didn't the victims\nreport it to\nthe police?
Didn't they see him\non the security\ncameras?
Diet first... Then I'm\ngonna go all out\nat a buffet!
Do food critics\nreally have that\nmuch influence?
Do you think the\nclass rep is, uh,\nsingle?
Do you think those\nshops that closed\ncan reopen?
Does anyone actually\nbelieve what food\ncritics say?
Does anyone even use\nphone booths\nthese days?
Doesn't he have\nany weaknesses?
Don't listen to what\nothers say. As long\nas you like it...
Drinks these days\ncome in all sorts of\nweird flavors.
Error: tnxotb-[6]
Error: tnxotb-[7]
Error: tnxotb-[8]
Even if you said\nsorry, we don't have\nto forgive you!
Every shop feels\nshort-staffed now.
Every store\nhas a line.
Finally finished\nwork...
Food reviews these\ndays are pretty\nentertaining.
Go into the family\nbusiness, or set off\non my own. Hm...
Guess I'm spending\nthe night at an\ninternet caf\xe9.
Haha, that pose!\nIs he trying to look\nlike a samurai?
Hahaha! Seriously?\nStill, losing to a\nkid? Pathetic!
Has it really been\nthat long since the\nincident...?
Has that girl gotten\neven better?
He always talks so\nbig, but he might\nreally be weak.
He came forward?\nHe didn't get\ncaught?
He may stand out on\nour team, but he's\nnot all that.
He only attacks\nwomen. It's\nterrifying...
He told that\nreporter it was\na real pitch...
He's not here,\nis he?
He's the only one\nnot here yet.
Heritage Kitchen was\nreally delicious.
Hey! What are you\nlooking at?
Hey, wait up!
Hey, why are you\nstill not here...
Hiih...\nHaah...
Honey, I'm here!\nWhere are you?
How dare they laugh\nat me... Screw those\nbastards!
How long should\nwe practice today?
How'd they get such\ngood reviews? The\nservice stinks.
Huh? He turned\nhimself in?
Huh? Seriously?
Huh? So that was the\nbest he could do?
Huh? You have\nthat figure!?
Hurry up and decide\nwhere we're\ngoing already!
I can finally\nrest at ease.
I can't believe\npeople like Miyazawa\nactually exist.
I can't focus\nat all.
I can't relax...
I can't remember\nanything... I'm just\ntrapped here...
I don't care\nanymore...
I don't even have an\nappetite anymore...
I don't feel like\ndoing much lately...
I don't really like\nthat new teacher...
I don't trust food\ncritics. Not\nafter Miyazawa.
I don't want to do\nanything. It's all\nso boring...
I don't want\nto go home...
I dropped\nmy wallet...
I feel exhausted\nevery day...
I found a new shop.
I got it!\nLet's get\nsushi today!
I guess the police\ncan do their job\nafter all.
I have zero\nappetite... Maybe\nit's stress.
I haven't seen that\nhalf-Japanese\ngirl today.
I haven't thought\nabout the future\nat all...
I hear\nVictory Kitchen\nis pretty good.
I heard a student\ngot injured\nrecently...
I heard he hangs\naround the station.
I heard he only\ntargets women.\nHow disgusting.
I heard he was\ncaught right here.
I heard that shop is\ncollaborating with a\ngourmet critic.
I heard the Subway\nSlammer's just some\noffice worker.
I heard the train\nstopped. What\nhappened...?
I heard the\nconvenience store\nis hiring.
I heard there was\nan owl here during\nthe day!
I heard there's\na kid with a pet owl\naround here.
I heard\nthat food critic\napologized.
I hope I\nget scouted...
I hope he spends the\nrest of his life\nbehind bars.
I hope that girl\nis all right...
I hope these days\nwill never end.
I know!
I miss that izakaya.
I miss those\ngarlic-filled\ndumplings.
I really want to\npull a rare figure.
I saw Noge-san earlier.\nI hope she's doing\nokay now.
I saw a great new\nanime. You should\ncheck it out!
I saw when he was\ncaught. He was just\na normal guy.
I see a young girl\nwith a donation box\nhere sometimes.
I should clean, but\nI get tired just\nthinking of it.
I think I'll have my\nboyfriend come\npick me up.
I wanna go home\nand play games.
I wanna go lie\ndown somewhere...
I want Chinese\nfood today.
I want a new pair\nof sneakers...
I want dumplings...
I want to be\na gourmet critic too.
I want to eat fine\ncuisine from all\nover the world.
I want to eat\nsomething delicious.
I want to pet the\npigeons, but they\nalways fly away.
I want to stop at\nthe drugstore on the\nway home.
I want to\ngo on a trip.
I went to one of\nthose! Can't believe\nwhat he did.
I wish I\nhad a cat...
I won't make it in\ntime... But taxis are\nexpensive...
I wonder how long\nhis sentence is\ngonna be.
I wonder how\nKiuchi-sama's\ndoing...
I wonder if I\ncan still get\nyakisoba bread.
I wonder if Noge-san\nis okay...
I wonder if someone\ncould cover my\nshift...
I wonder if there's\na perfect place for\na date...
I wonder if they'll\ncatch the Subway\nSlammer soon.
I wonder if\nMagatsukami knows\nwho he is.
I wonder when I'll\nbe able to take\na break...
I wonder which books\nare popular lately.
I wouldn't mind\nstaying home and\ndoing nothing.
I'll stop at the\nconvenience store\non my way home.
I'm drinking\ntonight!
I'm exhausted.\nThink I'll go to the\nbathhouse.
I'm gonna sing\nuntil dawn!
I'm hungry...
I'm hungry.\nLet's go eat.
I'm in a\ngood mood today...
I'm really not\nfeeling it right\nnow...
I'm sleepy. Maybe a\nnap will make me\nfeel better.
I'm so sick of the\nsame old routine...
I'm tired. I feel\nsleep-deprived\nevery day.
I'm too scared\nto go out into\nthe city now...
I'm too scared\nto walk alone.
I'm working every\nday and have no\ntime for myself.
I've been so busy\nlately, I haven't\nhad a break...
I've been to all the\nshops around here...
I've been waiting\nfor a while now...\nWhere are you?
I've never run into\nhim, but I'm glad he\nwas arrested.
I've only seen stuff\nabout the Subway\nSlammer online.
If I had a boyfriend,\nhe would carry my\nbags for me...
If I meet him, I'll\nmake sure he\nregrets it.
If he does make it\nto majors, he won't\nlast long.
If it's true, that's\npretty abysmal.
Is this line just\nfor the fitting\nroom?
Isn't there a nicer\nrestaurant nearby?
It seems unsafe\naround here lately.
It took them way too\nlong to catch him.
It's a nice shop, so\nwhy are the reviews\nso bad?
It's always crowded\nhere no matter what\ntime you come.
It's nice to be able\nto go about the city\nwithout fear.
It's not even in the\nnews, and there's no\ninfo online...
It's our first time\nmeeting. Hmm, what\nare they like?
It's too crowded.\nI can't shop\nlike this.
Kiuchi's pitch got\nhit by some kid.\nNo way, right?
Kiuchi-sama...\nWhere is he, anyway?
Let's ask Shichi-kun\nif he knows any new\nshops nearby!
Let's check out\nthat shop.
Let's get a drink\nafter we eat!
Let's go back to\nthat old shop!
Let's go buy\nsome flowers.
Let's go eat at\nthat new shop.
Let's go eat cr\xeapes.
Let's go get\nsomething to drink.
Let's go to the\nunderground mall\nat the station.
Let's go to\nShinjuku.
Let's go to\nthe bookstore.
Let's hurry home.\nIt's been dangerous\nhere lately.
Let's just eat\nsomething.
Let's just go get\nramen from\nVictory Kitchen.
Let's just go to a\nplace with\nsolid reviews
Looks like a new\nmovie is coming out.
Make sure to take\na good one!
Man, school was fun.\nAside from tests and\nbeing broke...
Maybe I should buy\nsome new clothes.
Maybe I'm cursed...\nShould I get my\nfortune told?
Miyazawa ruined\nVictory Kitchen's\nflavor...?
Miyazawa's a Menace?\nBut his show was\nso good...
Miyazawa's channel\nis gonna bite\nthe dust now!
My entire body is\ncovered in grilled\nmeat stink.
My heart races every\ntime I see you.
My luck's no good\nlately. Maybe I'll\ngo to a shrine.
My muscles are\nkilling me. I've\nbeen slacking.
Nice. I'm gonna\npost this online.
No new stores are\nopening lately...
No news from\nDivine Justice...
No updates from\nDivine Justice yet.
Not bad...
Nothing beats a\nhearty home-cooked\nmeal.
Nothing beats the\nusual go-to!
Now I don't have to\nbe so scared to go\nout anymore.
Oh no! I'm going\nto be late for\nmy shift!
Oh no! I'm gonna be\nlate for my date!
Oh right...
Oh, Miyazawa just\nposted some kind of\nannouncement.
Old movies aren't\nbad. What's showing\nnext month?
Online shopping is\nso convenient.
Ooh, a fortune\nteller in Shinjuku\nyou say?
Ooh, something's\ngoing down on\nDivine Justice.
Ouch... It still hurts\nwhere he hit me...
Ramen... Ramen...
Really?
Really? Seriously?
Sato-senpai is\ndefinitely our\nMVP, but...
Seems like everyone\ngoes on Divine\nJustice lately.
Shhh, someone will\nhear you!
Shichi-kun's working\nlate every day...
Should we grab a\ndrink somewhere?
Since Miyazawa's\napology, a lot of\ncritics quit...
So Miyazawa screwed\nover that little\nramen place?
So it was Miyazawa's\nfault that store\nshut down!?
So tired...
Someone got pushed\non the tracks! Hope\nthey're okay...
Someone got shoved\nhere in broad\ndaylight.
Someone was shoved\nviolently at\nthe station!
Sorry I'm late!
Sorry to keep\nyou waiting.
Sticking around here\nisn't so bad,\nreally...
Take online reviews\nwith a massive pinch\nof salt.
Takeyuki Kiuchi...\nThe former baseball\npro, right?
Takeyuki Kiuchi?\nWho's that?
Talking shit behind\nmy back!?
That Subway Slammer\nactually injured\nsomeone?
That Subway Slammer\nnever came to\nShinjuku, huh.
That bastard Kiuchi.\nI hope he rots in\njail for life.
That bastard should\nhave been caught a\nlong time ago.
That car looks\nexpensive.
That fortune teller\nChihaya in Shinjuku\nis pretty cute.
That girl who was\npushed on the tracks\nis in hospital.
That girl's amazing\nat guitar.
That girl's reading\npeople's fortunes.\nIs she legit?
That gourmet food\ncritic is popular\nthese days.
That guy's\npretty cute.
That movie was\npretty good.
That must've been\nreally tough!
That ramen shop in\nShinjuku is getting\na lot of buzz.
That restaurant was\ngreat! I gotta post\npics online.
That was Noge-san\njust now, right?\nCute as always...
That's fake, right?\nNo way it looks like\nthe photo.
That's not right.
That's seriously\ntraumatizing.
The Subway Slammer\nhas become quite\na hot topic.
The Subway Slammer\nwas once a pro\nbaseball player?
The airsoft shop guy\ndoesn't look like\na civilian...
The airsoft shop\nover there is\nreal cool.
The caf\xe9 over\nthere is really\ngood...
The doctor at that\nclinic is real\nstrange...
The food I cook\nmyself is the\nmost delicious.
The gym trainer\nseems a bit strange.
The internet's\nso boring lately.
The manager of\nthe airsoft shop\nis scary...
The new release is\nout! I'm staying\nup all night!
The new teacher is\nso hot... Should I\ntalk to him?
The new teacher? Oh,\nI was distracted by\nRiko-senpai...
The new teacher\nseems pretty good.
The police should\ndo something soon.
The ramen at\nVictory Kitchen\nis really good.
The shop's too\ncrowded. Where\nshould we go?
The underground mall\nmight have a good\ngift for her...
The underground\nmall's got new\nclothes in stock!
The world is getting\nmore dangerous\nevery day.
There are some real\nsickos out there.
There are too many\npeople making food\nreview videos.
There haven't been\nany good anime\nlately...
There's a good ramen\nshop in Shinjuku.
There's a lot of\nfood review streams\nthese days.
There's a really\ncute chubby cat\nin Zoshigaya.
There's a scary guy\non the rooftop...
There's always\nstudents studying\nat the diner.
There's been so many\nnew shops opening\nhere lately.
There's too many...
These clothes\nare so cute!
These reviews are\nglowing... Were they\npaid off?
These two review\nscores are totally\ndifferent...
They don't seem to\nknow anything.
They finally caught\nthat guy.
They're still talking\nabout Miyazawa? Who\neven cares?
Things feel really\ndangerous lately.
Think I'll visit\nthe bookstore.
This guy... I should\nreport him online as\na Menace.
This is delicious!\nI've gotta bookmark\nthis place...
This is the time we\nagreed on. Where\nare they?
This place has a\nlow rating. Let's go\nsomewhere else.
This place has\ngotten a lot of bad\nreviews lately.
This place is\ndelicious! Why's the\nrating so bad?
This place seems to\nhave good ratings.\nLet's eat here.
This store is\nso last season.
This sucks, man...
This sucks. I just\nwanna go home and\nhit the sack.
This weather's\nperfect for a\nlunchtime walk.
Those guys...\nAre they joking!?
Today I'll treat\nmyself to a steak.
Ugh! Why does\neverything have to\nbe so annoying?
Ugh...
Uh... This tastes\nstrange. I don't\nlike it.
Wait a minute...
Wait, is that\ncritic just making\nstuff up?
Wait...
Wanna go to karaoke?
Wanna head home\ntogether?
Wasn't that gourmet\nreview show on\ntoday?
We can't trust\neverything food\ninfluencers say.
We reached our sales\nquota for the month!\nLet's celebrate!
We should stop\ntalking. If someone\noverhears us...
Were there really\nthis many victims?
What are they\ndoing here?
What happened?
What is there to\neven gain from being\na Menace?
What should I do...
What should I do\nfor dinner?
What should I eat?
What should\nI get her...?
What the heck is\nan "educational\nadvisor"?
What was my name,\nagain?
What was the name of\nMiyazawa's channel\nagain?
What's that?
When are they going\nto catch him?
When will Heritage\nKitchen reopen?
When will I ever\nwin first prize?
When will that shop\nin Zoshigaya reopen?
Where should I get\na part-time job?
Where should we go\nafter school today?
Which shop should\nI go to today?
Who would do\nsuch a thing?\nThat's terrible.
Who would want to go\nup against a gourmet\nfood critic?
Whoa! Someone broke\nthe record at the\nbatting cages?
Whoa! Who can afford\nto spend this much\non clothes?
Why are you\nalways late?
Why aren't you\nanswering the phone?
Why do I have to\nfill in this\ndumb form?
Why do I have to\nstudy so much?
Why doesn't that\ngirl with the guitar\nsell CDs?
Why hasn't he\nbeen arrested?
Why hasn't she\nbeen scouted?
Why haven't you\nbeen texting me\nlately...?
Why isn't the mascot\na cat?
Why would a baseball\nplayer do something\nlike that...?
Why would someone\nslam into people?\nIt's so scary.
Without Miyazawa's\nreviews, I dunno\nwhat to eat...
Wonder if there's\nanything good on\nTV tonight.
Wonder if there's\nanything new on\nDivine Justice.
Would anyone really\nslam into people\non purpose?
Wow, it looks really\ndelicious in\nthe photo.
Yeah. But you know\nwhat he said after?
Yes! They finally\ngot him!
