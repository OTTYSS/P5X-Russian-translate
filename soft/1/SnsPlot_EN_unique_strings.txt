"Answer in 50 words or less."
"Aroma" this,\n"hot spring minerals" that,\nyou name it.
"Contrary to expectations."|Well, you come off as serious.
"Cream Soda!"
"Hula" means "dance", and\n"salsa" means "sauce".
"I'm totally gonna fail this\ntest! Help me cram!"
"Surprisingly"? What did he\nmean by that?
"The dude on the bass was\ngood. Is he in your band?"
"What kind of person do you\nwant to be in the future?"
"What matters is\nwhat comes next."
'Cause I need a new vacuum\ncleaner and a kettle too!\nLife is hard.
'Cause when we were\nplaying together earlier,\nI was thinking...
'Night, guys.
(Hold Mode: Reply Later)
...By which I mean your\nvirtual room, of course!
...and I'd like you to\ncheck it to make sure\nmy Japanese is correct!
...and I'd wish you'd hurry up\nand become a mature young man\nalready.
...before such a feat can be achieved.
...it doesn't mean\nyou don't change.
...we could be with each other\nuntil morning.
20-20 vision.|Nope.
A bassist has always gotta be\non point with both the rhythm\nand root notes.
A bunch of stuff.\nA new mic, headphones,\nan audio interface...
A bunch of them seem like\nthey'd totally be your thing!
A corrupt producer can ruin\neven the most talented idol.
A little bit, yeah... But more\nhappy than anything else.
A long time ago, I sprinkled\nsome on a friend's watermelon.
A long time ago, I was able\nto get my hands on psychic\ntraining tools.
A lot of them are pretty cute\ntoo with these unique poses.
A lot of words related to\nfoods and seasonings\ntend to double up.
A major impediment to our\ngreat quest has appeared...
A message came through\nMiyazawa's manager apologizing\nto Victory Kitchen.
A new ramen place opened up\nnear school.
A place by the station.|A stylist in my neighborhood.
A unit name?|Um, what?
AAAAAA==
Aaaaahhhhh!!! I knew it! Nooo!
About the sauce?|That stuff on etymology?
About today's modern lit\nhomework...
According to my research on\nidol photo shoots...
Actually, I guess that's a bit\nof an oxymoron...
Actually, I'm making pasta\nwith Musubi right now.
Adults are always telling us\nto watch our language\nand stuff.
After all, I've learned\nprivate inquiries are taboo.
After all, the best way\nto recreate something is\nto see it with your own eyes!
After all, we're the\nchosen ones!
After our photo shoot the\nother day...
After years out of the\npublic eye, she has returned\nto the spotlight.
Ah! Thank you,\n{NAME1}-san!
Ah, I see. Sorry to hear it...\nThere's always\nnext time!
Ah, but I guess you\naren't a housewife...
Ah, excuse me!
Ah, good idea. Hope they\nhave somethin'.
Ah, if we rent it out,\npets might be okay.
Ah, so you were thinking about\nme even during your own solo\nthen...
Ah, somewhere nice and close!
Ah, that's too bad.\nWell, lemme if you\nchange your mind.
Ah...!
Ahaha, those things're mostly\nfluff, don't ya think?
Ahh, you can't go wrong with\ngames. They're perfect for\nkilling time!
Ahhh! I said it!\nOkay, bye bye!
Akashi is unbelievable...
Aliases?|Like code names?
All I can do now is pray for\nNaruru to find peace.
All I can think about today is\ncream soda.
All right, I'm goin' to\nbed then.
All right. I'll be waiting.
All the time.|I treasure them.
Allow me to show you\naround this world!
Also, anything come to mind\nthat's popular with high\nschoolers these days?
Also, for the record...
Also, it's not a "thing"\nI'll have you know!
Although I am reluctant to use\nthe term "fan" to describe\nmy relationship with them.
Although they did make sure to\nsqueeze in a humblebrag about\ngetting autographs after.
Although you gotta agree\nthat this is an absolute gem\nof a find. Haha.
Amazing.|Sounds like a great goal.
An elementary schooler.\nTurns out it was the\nperfect fit, too!
An intriguing proposal... But\nwould it not require the unit\nto consist of multiple idols?
And I forgot to save\nthe photo.
And I thought I'd buy my\nmom and dad something\nwith the money.
And Leo-chan's going to be\noff doing his own thing\nsoon too...
And also...
And before I knew it, I sent\nyou a text. Sorry, haha!
And don't forget to lock up\nwhen you leave the house!
And for some reason I was\npicked as the replacement.
And for that, I must say,
And it looks like reciting\nan incantation isn't enough\nto summon an evil entity.
And it's been super-duper\nhelpful.
And remember to water the\nplants outside.
And still have room\nfor noodles.
And that's a promise!
And that's what kind of person\nI want to become.
And the book was a grimoire of\ndemon-summoning rituals!
And the rights to the shop\nwere returned to Pops.
And they're running this\nopening promo.
And this guy from a record\ncompany asked if I would put\nout a song with them!
And we've left you some money\nto cover any expenses,\nso don't go wasting it.
And when he was done...
Anyone would feel the same.|It's a matter of restraint.
Anyway! No surprise pinch\nof salt on your watermelon.
Anyway, I have a favor to ask.\nWould you mind recording me?
Anyway, I hope you continue\nto keep in touch with both me\nand Leo-chan, okay?
Anyway, I just thought I'd let\nyou know the spell was fake.
Anyway, I'm going to put the\nshow on now.
Anyway, see ya!
Anyway, their tails started\nbouncing along to the\nrhythm...
Anyway...
Anyway... We always have\nto stick together for stuff\nlike this! Safety first!
Anyways, I've been called to\nthe faculty office. I need to\ngo now.
Apparently he's holding an\nemergency press conference\nthis afternoon.
Apparently she's going to\nskate to the song I chose\nfor her!
Apparently, it comes from\nthe Japanese word "shoyu".
Apples grow in cold climates.\nThe greater the difference in\ntemp between day and night,
Apples, however,\ngrow well when cold!
Apples.|Mandarins.
Appreciate it.|Thanks!
Are there any you\nwould recommend,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Are they just posting whatever\nthey want to try to wear me\ndown?
Are they your favorite?|Just burn it off.
Are you a model student?
Are you drunk?|Something wrong?
Are you familiar with\nlive-action hero shows?
Are you good at languages,\n{NAME1}-san?
Are you good at math,\n{NAME1}-san?
Are you interested in idols?
Are you making proper use of\nthe Phantom Idols?
Are you mastering Persona\nfusion?
Are you okay? The house\ndoesn't feel too empty,\ndoes it?
Are you ready to enter\nMementos?
Are your parents still on that\ntrip, {NAME2}-chan?
Around the same time,\nJapanese people from the\nGoto Islands in Nagasaki...
As a legitimate idol,\nNaruru would be\nin the center.
As always, you exceed\nmy expectations.
As such, I shall not even\nshare details of\nthe store's location.
As such, I wish to clarify\nthat I would never abandon\nmy duties.
As such, this charm has the\npotential to raise desire.
As the leader of the Phantom\nThieves, you must connect with\nyour allies and build trust.
As you can probably tell,\nI was very drunk back then.
Ask anyone else and they'd\nonly bring up rice and bread.
At Central Street, 'kay?
At any rate, I'll do my best\nto make sure it doesn't\nget any worse!
At any rate, the fact that\nI have to show good results\nhasn't changed a bit.
At first I thought he was just\nsome guy in a wheelchair...
At the very least, she has the\nqualities I seek in an idol.
At this point, just seeing\nyour face is enough to calm\nmy nerves.
Awesome! I'll be waiting at my\nusual spot.
Awesome! I'm looking forward\nto learning a lot from you!
Awesome! Let's meet somewhere.
Awesome. I'm always ready for\nsome coaching!
Aww geez, I'd take the\nconstant nagging any day\nover a ticking time bomb!
Aww geez... Somehow that\nfeels even heavier, y'know?
Aww, I want a pet so badly!
Aww, you're making me blush.\nBut go on! Keep the\ncompliments flowing!
Backtracking a bit...
Bam, back to zero savings with\njust a few mouse clicks.
Basically, soy is a\nJapanese loanword.
Be right there.|Sorry, I'm busy.
Be strong, stand your ground!|I'll negotiate with it.
Before we harvest the cyber\nwatermelons, I have to ask...
Behold! The new Yui\nis here, bursting with\nserene tranquility!
Being a housewife is all about\nbuying the best thing possible\nat the cheapest price.
Being a musician is so\nexpensive!
Believe it or not, I used to\nwork in fashion.
Better luck next time!
Better make sure I don't\nhave any work that day.
Better put my nose to the\ngrindstone, as they say...
Both, I think...\nI'm half afraid,\nhalf excited... Heh.
Bring it on!
Burgers are so expensive\nthese days, huh! They used\nto be a lot cheaper.
Business must be booming.|Makes me feel welcome.
But I actually don't know what\nsort of things they like.
But I can still remember all\nthe rules in baseball.
But I can't relax till I hear\nit straight from the horse's\nmouth.
But I don't know the first\nthing about tutoring...
But I found it pretty\ncomplex...
But I found this one that's\nbeen floating around\nthe web recently...
But I guess if I'm gonna be a\nPhantom Thief, I'll need some\ngall.
But I have a bit of a problem.\nAre you free, by any chance,\n{NAME2}?
But I just can't find one\nthat feels right for me.
But I just can't\nget it right...
But I know that if I exercise\nby myself, I'm probably gonna\nslack off.
But I know that talking to you\nhelps me sort out how I feel.
But I was wrong.
But I will consider it.
But I would have never even\nconsidered eating it the way\nthey serve it here\u2014raw.
But I'll take your suggestion\nand look forward to continuing\nour chat tomorrow.
But I'm not sure what I\nshould get. Do you have\nany suggestions?
But Mom said I can't go unless\nI'm with an adult.
But a bunch of them actually\nagreed to do it!
But almost all the films\nI wanted to watch aren't\navailable there anymore.
But as they say, you'll never\nknow unless you try.
But because of that...
But diehard fans like me and\nmy folks know it anywhere.
But do give it some thought\nonce the time comes, will you?
But even if it's a lie, it\nstill bothers me.
But everyone's so busy now,\nI hardly get a chance to\ninvite them out.
But if I hold back, and\nend up failing to convey\nwhat I want to, well...
But if I was helpful\nto you in the slightest,\nthen I am satisfied.
But if we're not on a mission,\nyou can just use my real name.
But in my defense...
But instead of beating\nmyself up and backing off...
But it basically means\nthe real deal! Not the dishes\ntweaked for Japanese palates.
But it could be nice to pair\nthem with some food.
But it doesn't seem like it\nworked properly, either way.
But it ended up being\nreally fun!
But it is full of nature,\nwhich is something you don't\ntend to see in the city.
But it looks like it was\njust an illusion created\nby the camera angle...
But it seems I was worrying\nfor nothing!
But it's not like you have all\nthe money in the world, right?
But it's worse for me since\nI do flair bartending.
But like, there were a bunch\nthat I wasn't sure how you\ncould play with that setup.
But man, I couldn't believe\nhow many bath salts\nthey stock in this country!
But maybe people just want to\nget things done without the\nfuss of talking with anyone?
But maybe this means that\nI still have a sharp eye\nwhen it comes to looks?
But my impression of you\nhas changed!
But nothing's come after me.\nI haven't even sensed\nanything unholy.
But now that I've quit...\nit's only getting worse.
But now, I think my love for\nit is a good thing... Maybe?
But people close their eyes\nto it all so easily!
But some really\nover-the-top types\nin class got behind it...
But that might not be what\nthe customer wants.
But that rule only applies\nto eating out.
But that's not all! I also got\na synth keyboard, more cables,\nand some spare strings.
But the manager threw in\nthe towel after one bite...
But the trust of the people\ncan be useful. I intend to put\nin the appropriate effort.
But their roasted pork slices\nreally stood out.
But then Motoha was raving\nabout this one streaming site,\nso I signed up.
But then the software wouldn't\nlaunch, and my PC wouldn't\ndetect the audio interface...
But they all just said they're\ndoing fine and... like...
But this may be the very\nanswer to the type of person\nI want to become.
But we won't know until you're\nold enough to drink.
But we're Phantom Thieves?|We got interviewed?
But we're neighbors first and\nforemost, so here's to years\nof good memories to come!
But when it comes to baseball,\nI guess they're infused with\nmy muscle memory?
But when the nurse wheeled\nhim by, I recognized his face\nright away!
But when the time comes...
But you don't really see them\ndangling from people's phones\nthese days, do you?
But, a lot of people\nseem pretty excited\nto see her return!
But...
But... I have no clue what\nto do with my spare mitt\nand stuff I don't need.
By all means.|I'm curious about them, too.
By the way, feel free to use\nwhatever's in the fridge if\nyou feel like cooking.
By the way...
C'mon, let's study together,\n{NAME2}!
Calm down.|You've gone beyond fandom.
Can I use your kitchen?
Can you come back to the\nclassroom? There's something\nyou should see.
Can you cook, {NAME2}-kun?
Can you tell what I'm\nlooking at right now?
Can't beat a dog's loyalty.|I prefer cats.
Can't even imagine.|Great for emotional training.
Can't get enough.|If I'm super bored.
Cats really like you, huh?|Stray cats!?
Cause you do all the talking.|You're the energetic one.
Cheater...|No longer a fan of Naruru?
Coach Tomoko in the house!|I'd love to join in next time.
Cold noodles.|Ramen.
Colorful ones.|Only the best quality.
Come by whenever.
Come to think of it, teaching\ntechniques was pretty easy!
Congrats!|Could this be your big break!?
Congrats!|I'm your fan too.
Congratulations!|Good job, Teach.
Consider it my way of saying\nthanks for all the things\nyou teach me!
Cool, me too.
Cool. Good to know.
Cool. I'll see what\nI can do...
Cool. Let's get going then.
Cool. Try to hurry, okay?
Could it be...
Could this be a prelude\nto something greater?
Could we meet up now?
Could you help me go over my\nmath textbook again?
Damn it...
Darkness?|Prince?
Denying it was my fault. I was\njust trying to make excuses\nto cover up for myself.
Depends on where you live,\nhuh. Like, pasta in Italy.
Did it 'cause you told me to.|Anything for Naruru.
Did they show up?|Not a demon?
Did this message surprise you?
Did you hear what everyone was\ntalking about in class today?
Did you know some Japanese\nwords exist in Chinese too,\nbut have different meanings?
Did you say hi?|So she's working there?
Did you see the commercial for\nthe new films that were just\nadded to that streaming site?
Did you see the news today?
Did you see what's on\nDivine Justice?
Didn't mean to get you all\nworried.
Didn't mean to put you on the\nspot, sorry. Let me know when\nyou're free.
Didn't realize the story was\nso sad. I straight up cried at\nthe end.
Divvying ideas up into\nteachable chunks\nis hard.
Do moms really want to know\nabout this stuff?
Do people still have pen pals?
Do you do anything else?
Do you eat yours with salt?
Do you even know what\nI'm talking about?
Do you feel that way too,\n{NAME2}?
Do you guys talk a lot?
Do you guys wanna watch the\npress conference together at\nlunch?
Do you have a favorite fruit?
Do you have any hobbies,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Do you have any kind\nof skincare routine,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Do you have any shops\nyou'd recommend?
Do you have any\nrecommendations\nfor a good movie?
Do you have time tomorrow\nafter school?
Do you know how to enter\nother worlds?
Do you know mine,\n{NAME1}-san?
Do you make your own dinner?\nThat must be tough.
Do you mind if I message\nyou to talk like this\nfrom time to time?
Do you recall our discussion\nabout live-action heroes?
Do you recall two employees\nwho informed us of\nNaruru's plight?
Do you remember that baseball\npro staying at my hospital?
Do you remember what was going\nthrough your head when you did\nthat improv bit?
Do you see yourself in them?|Do you want to live here?
Do you take videos?|Is that useful?
Do you think I could borrow a\nmoment of your time?
Do you watch movies\non streaming services,\n{NAME1}-kun?
Do you?
Does it now?|Why do you ask?
Does that happen to you?
Dog-faced man?|What was that again?
Don't forget your goal.|What do you want to do?
Don't go neglecting your\ngrades for our farm!
Don't overdo it.|Hey, take it easy.
Don't say things that could\nruffle people's feathers,\nthey say.
Don't talk about school much?|What do you discuss?
Don't tell me that he's\nsecretly expecting more\nfrom me than Mama!
Don't worry about me,\nI've got this.
Don't you ever get lonely\nliving by yourself?
Earlier, I attempted a ritual\nto summon a spirit of\ngood fortune...
Earlier, I was working out a\nriff for a song on the keys\nand suddenly thought of you.
Either they were hella brave,\nor incredibly desperate.
Emailing friends...?|Yeah, sorta.
English is handy for reading\nbooks from all over the world.

Especially when I have\nsomething super important\nto say.
Even as a chosen one, I don't\nwant to be overly conspicuous.
Even for chosen ones,\ntelepathy is difficult.
Ever tried rice?|Don't forget the dessert.
Every step of the setup, I was\ngetting endless stupid errors.
Everyone had something to say\nabout whether they'd give up\nor give in.
Exactly! A chosen one must\nconceal their true identity.
Exactly. Focusing on what's\nright or wrong isn't enough.
Excellent, fellow chosen one.\nLet's go investigate.
Excuse me!?
Excuse me. I wish for us to go\nsomewhere together to better\nunderstand your true self.
Excuse me. I wish to propose\nwe do something that differs\nto our usual meetings.
Fair enough. For some reason,\nthat makes me glad.
Feels like it's been forever\nsince I brought up a friend.
Find some time to go,\nit'd be such a waste to let\nthis chance pass you by!
Fine by me.|Today's kinda busy, actually.
Finished up at the clinic.|We have the drugs.
Food grudges can last\nan entire lifetime,\nyou know!
For a split second, we crossed\nbehind the person getting\ninterviewed!
For now, I shall welcome you\nas a fellow fan.
For now, it is vital that I\n"like" Naruru's posts on the\ncaf\xe9's social media.
For school, I have to squeeze\nall the information into my\nbrain.
For sure. I'm still trying to\nfigure out what it is I want.
For sure.|Not that I can think of...
French fries have waaay too\nmany. It made me so sad.
Friends? With me?\nNo, I couldn't impose.
From what I have observed,\nyou share many traits.
Fun should be number one.|You should try them all out.
Gave yourself to the rhythm,\nhuh?
Geez, all this stuff has gone\nto show me just how childish\nI can be.
Glad I came to you.\nI'll let you know\nhow it goes!
Glad to hear it.|As long as you learn from it.
Glad to hear it.|Calm down.
Go to the drugstore.|Try the convenience store.
Going back over and reading\nthat is making me feel\nkind of embarrassed...
Good call. Can't go wrong\nwith that.
Good day to you!
Good idea! That way it's sure\nto end up in the hands of\nsomeone who needs it.
Good idea. They're retro,\nbut still cute. I'll find\nsomewhere else to put them.
Good idea... Maybe it's\nnot too late to get my\nvisual acuity back.
Good idea.|I can't wait.
Good luck! And stay safe!
Good luck!|Isn't that all a bit much?
Good morning! It's morning\nthere, isn't it?
Good night! Sleep tight!
Good night.|Great work today, everyone.
Good night.|See you tomorrow.
Good thing you spoke up.|So, about that autograph?
Good work!|I'm impressed.
Good work!|Ready to start writing songs?
Got any friends who'd be\ninterested in women's\nbaseball gear?
Got any ideas on how to\nimprove your sleep quality?
Gotcha. Maybe some other time.
Gotta say, that's a relief\nto hear, Sensei. Thanks!
Great idea!
Great!
Great! As your mocktail\nmentor, I'm glad to see you\nput in the effort.
Great! I know this is sudden,\nbut are you able to come over\nnow?
Great! I'll wait at the front\nof the shop!
Great! I'll wait for you\nat my usual spot.
Great! Let me know when you're\nall set up!
Great! Meet you at the usual\nspot then.
Great! Thanks!
Great! Well, you know where to\nfind me!
Great, thanks so much!\nSo, where's a good spot\nfor us to meet?
Great, thanks!
Great. I feel a lot better.
Great. Then let's plan a day\nto go sometime!
Greetings.
Guess I said something\na little weird, huh.\nI'll mull it over a bit more.
Guess what Musubi told me!
Ha ha, I thought you'd\nsay that! And honestly,\nI really needed to hear it.
Haha!
Haha, it's fun to see someone\nwho's always so calm let\nloose.
Haha, not to brag, but you're\nspeaking to the freshman who\ngot the top grades in English!
Haha. Hilarious.
Hahaha!
Hahaha! Hey, I was\njust kidding, you know!\nYou're such a cutie!
Hang on. I'd better explain\nthe situation first.
Have any high school hobbies?|You should try something new.
Have trouble sleeping?|Are you feeling sick?
Have you heard about\nthe cursed video?
Have you tried it too,\n{NAME1}-san?
Having a feline audience felt\nkinda weird, but in a good\nway.
Having to see a kid off is\nso sad! It was the same\nwith my own son.
He definitely didn't do it.
He laughed and said I was\nsurprisingly friendly.
He praised me like\nnever before.
He thanked me for remembering\nhim, and burst into tears.
He told me he's been running\nevery morning for ninety\nyears!
He told me...
He was never a bad guy.|He got a bit screwy.
He's a one-hundred-year-old\ngrandpa who lives in the\nneighborhood.
He's going down.|Let's save Naruru.
Hearing that makes me feel a\nlittle better.
Heck, I might have to give\nsome of these salts a shot.
Hee hee! You're the second one\nto call me that, after Motoha.
Heeeyyyyyy!
Heh, of course we can't lose\nto some demon...
Heh, thanks.
Heh... Can't you see? With the\nforces of yin and yang working\nin unison, we are unstoppable!
Hehe, more! Praise me more!
Hehe, sounds good to me!\nRice bowls with toppings of\nthe day, huh...?
Hehe, thanks!
Hehe... Very good.\nI can feel my telepathic\nskills awakening.
Heheh... I saw you on the\nway home today, {NAME1}-san.
Hehehe, don't take me too\nseriously.
Hello
Hello there!\nAre you free at the moment?\nCause I sure am!
Hello!
Hello! It's me! Yui!
Hello!|You surprised me.
Hello. Thank you\nfor the other day.
Her comeback at the next\ncompetition is all anybody's\ntalking about.
Heritage Kitchen?\nIn Zoshigaya?
Hey Leader, I got a favor to\nask you.
Hey Sensei, do you read\nautobiographical manga?
Hey there.
Hey {NAME1}-kun,\nwhat do you look for\nin a part-time job?
Hey! Is this {NAME2}-kun?
Hey! No one asked for\na walking dictionary.
Hey! You free right now?
Hey!\nI'm a beautiful lady\u2014not cute!
Hey, I could use your help.
Hey, I know this is sudden...
Hey, I wanna talk to you about\nsomething...
Hey, I've got a favor to ask,\nRusset!
Hey, Russet.
Hey, Sensei!\nGot some free time today?
Hey, Sensei, umm...\nDo you have time today?
Hey, are you free today,\n{NAME2}?
Hey, can't blame me for being\ncurious. When it comes to\nflavors, I'm always serious...
Hey, did you see the news on\nTV just now?
Hey, happy birthday!
Hey, remember our soy talk?
Hey, remember when I asked you\nfor film recommendations on\nthat streaming platform?
Hey, so have you been wearing\nthe clothes I gave you?
Hey, uhh...\nare you busy lately?
Hey, you busy?
Hey, you busy?\nThere's something\nI gotta ask you.
Hey, you free now?
Hey, you free right now?

Hey, {NAME1}-san,\nare you good at\nwaking up early?
Hey, {NAME2}-chan,\nthere's something that's\nbeen on my mind lately...
Hey, {NAME2}-kun.\nWhat kind of mocktail sounds\ngood right about now?
Hey, {NAME2}.\nYou got a moment?
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Hi! I know this is a bit\nout of the blue, but\nare you free today?
Hm, I see. It happens to me\na lot.
Hm... If you say so...\nBut still...
Hm... Okay, lemme rephrase my\nquestion.
Hm... Yeah, maybe.
Hm... Yeah, that makes sense.\nI think it's the same for me.
Hmm... I wouldn't say that.
Hmm... Is that it?\nNot sure if I agree.
Hmm... Yeah, I can see that.
Hmmm, come to think of it...\nit's more like the rules are\ningrained in my body.
Honestly, I'm a little\njealous. I wish I was in the\nsame class as you guys.
Hope he gets better soon!
Hope you get to talk to him!|Ask for his autograph!
Hope you have a great day!
Hopefully, once my report's\ndone, inspiration will strike\nand I can play you the song!
Horror? I kinda hate jump\nscares...
How about "friends"?|Idol group fan?
How about hitting the batting\ncages after school?
How about potted flowers?|Could grow some veggies?
How am I gonna cope...?
How are you doing?
How could I forget?|Did you get to meet him?
How did it go?|What did he say?
How did she transform\nduring her time away?
How did you learn them?|That's 'cause it's your hobby.
How do you deal\nwith heartburn?
How do you usually pass\nthe time?
How does he do it?
How was it in baseball?|Try teaching by example.
How would you\nabbreviate that I wonder...\n"Socmed pals," maybe?
How ya feelin', Senpai?
How you greet her beforehand\nis of vital importance.
How's it going?
However, if idols are meant\nto show us dreams, then I do\nbelieve I was dreaming.
However, some devout fans\ncontinue to watch even\ninto adulthood.
Huh, I had no idea you watched\nromance flicks, {NAME2}.
Huh, okay! I learned\nsomething today. Thanks,\n{NAME2}-chan!
Huh, okay! I'll check out\none or two when I have\nthe time.
Huh, so that's what living\nalone is like?
Huh, yeah. I can\nunderstand that.
Huh, you might be right.
Huh... So like, show Motoha\nhow I study for exams?
Huh? What do you mean that's\nwhat it means?
Huh? What was I\nso worried about?
Humans cannot live\nwithout desire.
I added Riko-senpai to our\nchat group!
I admire it.|How's it differ to the city?
I admit I am not familiar with\nsuch names.
I also can't wait for you to\nhear them!
I always give new teas a try\nwhen I spot them in the\nconvenience store.
I always struggle to come up\nwith an answer when she asks\nme how university's going.
I am aware that I am a\nconcierge, not a producer.
I am ever loyal to Naruru, but\nI also enjoy their company.
I am here to support you. In\nreturn, I ask that you apply\nyourself diligently each day.
I am merely interested in her\ntransformation as an idol.
I am pleased to hear that.\nI shall be waiting for you.
I am prepared! I'm not a\nchosen one for nothing!
I am.|Not really.
I appear to be unaffected...\nThe inner workings of such a\nspell remain a mystery to me.
I appreciate the space,\nbut I admit it does\nbother me a bit.
I appreciate your\nunderstanding.
I ask for your continued\ncooperation.
I ask that you refrain from\nmisleading comments.
I assume you heard from\nLeo-chan already, but he's\ngoing to be leaving.
I barely put any effort into\nmaking dinner, and my cleaning\ngets pretty sloppy too.
I basically had to look up\nevery single fix, but I got it\ndone in the end.
I believe she more than has\nthe potential to become an\nidol.
I believe you've begun to\nunderstand Naruru's charm.
I bought them forever ago.
I came across such a show\nwhile strolling Akihabara.
I can educate you on Naruru's\ncharm another time.
I can fill you in more at my\nusual spot, so meet me there.
I can hardly wait for\nthe competition!
I can imagine.|Like a record.
I can instantly check what I'm\ndoing well or getting wrong.
I can make whatever I like.|I just order whatever I want.
I can't believe it.|Was it that good?
I can't decide.|I'm not familiar with it.
I can't do that right now,\nI'm afraid.
I can't help but bite back\nwhen someone disagrees\nwith me.
I can't recall important dates\nin history, but I'll never\nforget a friend's birthday.
I can't remember the last time\nI went on a trip with your\nfather...
I can't seem to remember\nanything we learn at school.
I can't stop scrolling\nthrough online videos\nwhen I'm bored...
I cooked with it today!
I could sense a strong\nconviction within her.
I couldn't exactly get\neveryone on board...
I couldn't forget what\nI've learned here,\neven if I wanted to.
I couldn't help but feel\na little nostalgic.
I did what I could.
I didn't want to make the\nnormies suspicious, so I fled\nbefore they could notice.
I do love baseball.\nI really do!
I do wonder what you think\nof the country life...
I don't even remember sending\nthem, to be honest.
I don't have that problem with\nyou though, do I, Sensei?
I don't have the ingredients.|I'm missing some tools.
I don't have to go out,\nand I can really take my time\nto think and choose!
I don't know how she did it.\nWhy'd they turn out so well?
I don't know how you do it...
I don't know if I'd call them\nhobbies, though. More like\ndreams or ambitions.
I don't know where this power\ncomes from, and I never really\nthought about it until now.
I don't know yet what\ntruly matters.
I don't know...|What about idols?
I don't mean like right now.\nI'll be at my usual spot, so\ncome by if you've got time.
I don't mind at all.|Bring on the taste-test-athon!
I don't see much of a point\nto all these machines.
I don't think I'll be able\nto help out for a while.
I dug it up from the darkest\ndepths of the web. I'm sure\nit's the real thing.
I dunno about my skin, though.\nIt made mine almost a bit\ntoo pale, know what I mean?
I dunno, I tried playing my\nfriend's bass back in the day.
I dunno, that seems kinda far.|The convenience store's close.
I dunno...|Sounds interesting.
I even bought this recording\nsoftware that all the pros\nuse. It was pretty pricey tbh!
I even have alcohol-free\ndays so I can really give it\nmy all.
I expect no less from a leader\nlike you! Once you lock on,\nyou never lose your target!
I feel better after talking\nto you, Sensei.
I feel like I am able to fully\nunderstand your feelings.
I feel like I can write this\nnow. Thanks, {NAME2}.
I feel like I generate a lot\nof power when I admire\nsomeone.
I feel like I made things\npretty awkward...
I feel like every time we see\neach other, you end up\nhelping me out.
I feel like there's no way I\ncan't make some great music\nnow!
I feel more confident talking\nit out with you though.
I feel refreshed now that I've\nlet it all out.
I figured it would be best to\njust put it all behind me.
I figured maybe they could\ngive me a few hints.
I finished my new song lyrics!
I found a ton of unopened ones\nwhen I was cleaning out\nmy closet.
I found someone to take my\nspare baseball equipment!
I get excited thinking about\nhow it'll make my food better.\nI just can't stop.
I get that, but...
I get that.|Are you giving up?
I get the feels when I recall\nall the fun times I had while\nplaying baseball.
I got a frantic message from\nMotoha. She was like...
I got a new smartphone!
I got mad and sad.\nDragged you here\nand there, Sensei...
I guess I gotta put in the\neffort if I wanna become the\nperson I view myself to be.
I guess I'm starting to\npick up her speaking habits...
I guess it's all about social\nmedia these days. Nobody sends\nfriends emails anymore, right?
I guess it's weird to say I'm\nlooking forward to it, but,\nuh, I actually kind of am!
I guess that's just the price\nI gotta pay to do what I love.\nI'll pay it off soon enough.
I guess that's what\nmatters most.
I guess there is still much to be done...
I guess they want you to pick.|You should trust your taste.
I guess, yeah.
I guess.|Not really.
I guess?|Like it's my job.
I had him try the best bowl\nof ramen I could make.
I had no idea that there were\npeople who prefer it without.

I have?
I haven't been able to learn a\nsingle thing in class all day\nbecause of it.
I haven't been able to sleep\nwell lately.
I haven't been to the batting\ncages in forever, either.
I haven't done it yet.|What was the question?
I haven't heard anything\nfrom her yet.
I hear there is a saying:\n"What one likes, one does\nwell."
I heard Kotone-san called the\nmusic club over yesterday.
I heard from Masa-san.
I heard that live-action hero\nshows are made for children.
I heard that stable\ntemperatures produce\nsourer fruit.
I heard that there are a lot\nof electronics stores there!

I highly recommend you follow\nNaruru's example.
I hope that attracts more\nteenagers like you and others\nwho can't drink.
I hope you stay that way!
I hope you two keep on\ngetting along!
I hope you won't follow in my\nfootsteps once you're older.\nDrink responsibly!
I imagine most people wouldn't\nrecognize him by name alone.
I just dropped Tomoko off\nat home.
I just found out\nabout it today...

I just saw the gibberish I\nsent you last time.
I just throw stuff on rice.|Hot pots are my go-to.

I knew you had good sense,\nHero of Light.
I know Chinese and\nJapanese supermarkets\nsell different stuff.
I know a lot happened with\nhim, but things seem to have\nworked out.

I know that this is out of\nthe blue
I know they'll just tell me\nanything's good if I ask...
I know we'll be gone a while,\nbut make sure to eat properly,\nokay dear?
I know you are!\nYou're my first and most\nimportant fan after all.
I know you can't drink, but\nyou should come to the bar\nsometime.
I know, right!?\nEspecially since I struggled\na lot with the last one.
I know, right? I can't let\nmyself lose to some gramps!

I let it slip that I was\na big fan, and, well...
I like arts and crafts.|I make a pretty mean omelette.
I like spending time with you.|I like you the way you are.
I like to keep up-to-date with\nwhat customers like. Ttyl.
I look forward to our\ncontinued partnership.
I look so young it's like I'm\nback in high school again!
I lost myself for a bit.
I love petting animals,\nbut caring for one is so\nmuch work, you know?
I made sure to keep everything\nthat was important to me.
I managed to save up some of\nmy paycheck, so I bought some\npro recording equipment...
I may have done something...
I may have found a shop that\nlooks super useful to help us\ninfiltrate the palace.
I mean, I could barely even\nmove when we were in the\nMetaverse!
I mean, that's true, I am\na chosen one, but still!
I might make my fair share\nof messes going forward.
I might still have some\ncostumes back home.\nI can teach you!
I might try next time I go.
I must clarify that this excursion\nis not bound by the terms of\nour contract. What do you say?
I need time to prepare.|I'm bad with jokes.
I need to check out a student\nhot spot. Can you come?
I need to have full control\nover my emotions. Is that\ncalled a poker face?
I need to know...\nWhat fascinating news!\nI must do more research!
I need to throw my weight into\nbeing a Phantom Thief.
I need to try raw egg\nover rice!
I need to try this out.
I need to work on my\nself-restraint.
I need you to tell me that it\nisn't true, {NAME2}.
I never thought I'd end up\nthinking this way.
I only did what any fan would.
I only worry about whether\nor not they're picking up\nwhat I'm putting down.
I passed by an arcade and saw\none when I peeked inside.

I recall telling you\nsome time back
I saw a photo of it\nonline, remember?
I saw us in an interview!
I say it's fine to have\nnoodles for all three meals.
I see that you have grown even\nstronger.
I see!
I see. Thanks!
I see. Yeah, now that you\nmention it, you might\nbe right.
I see...
I see... All I gotta do is\njust exercise more to\ncompensate?
I see... That makes sense.
I see... You're a good friend\nwith a kind heart, {NAME2}.
I see.|Same here.
I sense a newfound desire\nrising within me.
I shall brief you on the\ndetails of this proposal\nwhen we meet in person.
I should be able to cook up\nsomething interesting.
I should have expected you\nto know, {NAME1}-san.
I should investigate\nlive-action heroes further.
I start slacking with\nthe housework when\nI'm by myself.
I still go to the hospital for\nregular checkups, right?
I suggest we find the\nanswer together.
I suppose I can't deny\nthe possibility.
I suppose I have something of\nan eye for talent.
I suppose it would work\nif the three were to\nform a group...
I sure have.|But things are getting tough.
I taught her a bunch of stuff\nwhen we used to play baseball.
I think I'd be relaxed.|I'd probably go off the walls.
I think I'll start with some\neasy-to-serve items.
I think I'm going to try\ntranslating a grimoire soon.
I think so too. Kiuchi changed\na lot faster than we expected.
I think that could work.|I want to see.
I think this unit could work.
I think...
I thought I knew what people\nthought of me.
I thought I was getting a\nlittle out of shape.
I thought about it, but\nI was on my own.
I thought about it\non my travels...
I thought my heart was gonna\npop out of my chest.
I thought our work as Phantom\nThieves would've made me more\nresilient to this kinda stuff.
I thought that me dropping out\nsuddenly caused huge problems.
I told my mom about you\nat dinner today.
I told you all the recording\nequipment I ordered showed\nup, right?
I tried making my own homemade\nseasoned bamboo shoots.
I tried some ramen at this\nrun-down Chinese restaurant.
I understand wanting to\nact like a bad boy, though.\nIn fact, it's a relief!
I use a different method.|There's an easier way.
I use my computer to keep\nin touch with Mama.
I used to be a serious collector.
I used to have more stamina\nwhen I was in college...\nProbably because I did dance.
I used to put fake tan on all\nthe time back in high school.

I wanted to watch an action\nmovie, so I subscribed to a\nstreaming service.
I was concerned that you might\nnot log on during exam season.
I was exploring a mysterious\nbookstore when I came across\nan old book covered in dust.
I was getting lonely\nonly talking to you\nin that world.
I was going to refuse\nthe position at first
I was just curious is all!\nThanks for humoring me.
I was looking it up earlier.
I was pondering on the notion\nof Naruru and her coworkers\nbecoming an idol group.
I was so captivated!\nIt was really good!
I was thinking it might\nbe nice to dance again.
I was thinking of doing\nsomething a little different\nthis time... Care to join me?
I was thinking of studying at\nthe diner.
I was thinking of studying\nfor that quiz tomorrow...
I was waiting for you\nto say that!
I was wondering if I could ask\nyou for some advice myself.
I was wondering if we could\nmeet up and I could talk\nto you about it.
I was wondering what\nMagatsushin would post,\nbut this...
I went a bit too hard with my\nflair bartending practice and\nnow my limbs are killing me...

I wish I could say things the\nbest way possible\u2014or at least\nbe nice about it.
I wish for you to become\nan adult filled with such\na bountiful desire.

I wonder which.
I would like to wish you a\nhappy birthday.
I wouldn't go that far...|Almost a full-fledged fan!
I wouldn't say regret.
I'd always thought you\nwere just a regular kid\nin the neighborhood...
I'd better make an appointment\nnow. See you tomorrow!
I'd hate to throw it out, but\nif I can't find any takers...
I'd like to visit your room!
I'd like to visit.|Sounds fun.
I'd look just like the old me\nif they'd let me adjust the\nmakeup and skin a little...
I'd love to check them out\nsometime. It'd be a whole lot\neasier than going to Hakata.
I'd love to go check out\nHakata and the Goto Islands\nsometime!
I'd love to hear about your\ntraining regimen sometime.
I'd love to make some\nmocktails with you.
I'd love to.|Reply later

I'm actually looking for one\nright now.
I'm all ears.|I'll have to get back to you.
I'm all ears.|What's up?
I'm all set.
I'm alone for a while, yeah.|Yup. They're such lovebirds.
I'm amazed by your knowledge.|How about "naan bread"?
I'm at the diner right now,\nso if you're free, I could\nreally use your help!

I'm being serious!
I'm bored out of my mind.\nTell me a joke!
I'm doing fine.|It really doesn't.
I'm down.|I need to check my schedule.
I'm finally learning how\nlackadaisical I can be.

I'm grateful to you too.|You've changed too, Merope.
I'm in a good mood and thought\nI'd text you!
I'm just a bit worried about\nyou since we won't be back for\na while.
I'm just a little stuck on the\nsong I'm writing right now.
I'm just glad to see\nyou do act your age\nevery now and then.
I'm just listening.|Got your thoughts sorted?
I'm just living my life.|You really think so?
I'm kind of curious now.|Does authentic mean spicy?
I'm listening.|What sort of movie is it?
I'm looking forward to\ndrinking with you someday.
I'm making the most of my time\nhere in Japan, but sometimes\nmy studies take a back seat...
I'm not drunk tonight!
I'm not so worried about\ngrades that I'd try to pay my\nway out.
I'm not sure... Spirits aren't\nusually visible to the\nhuman eye, after all.
I'm not that kind of person.\nDon't get the wrong idea!
I'm not the only one out there\nwith a short fuse, huh?
I'm off to try somethin' new\nto develop my palate.\nWanna tag along?
I'm really excited to make\nsome new music.
I'm really glad I got to\nmeet him.
I'm really glad you're my\ncoach, {NAME2}.
I'm really grateful.
I'm researching how to develop\ntelepathic abilities.
I'm so glad to hear you\nsay that! Well, then here's\nto even more meddling!
I'm so happy that you're\nmaking my mocktails,\n{NAME2}-kun.
I'm spinning too! Haha! Whee!
I'm starting to think a full\nmeal would sell better than\nsnacks.
I'm still in the middle\nof my studies.
I'm still in the middle\nof my studies...
I'm super curious to learn\nmore about your taste!
I'm super grateful.\nI'll thank you properly later!
I'm sure drunk me would be\nhappy to hear that.
I'm sure it will.|I can't wait.
I'm the one who'll be\nin trouble if I don't,\nafter all.
I'm the only one who struggles\nto keep it cool!?
I'm the same!
I'm thinking up some new\nrecipes, so this'll help give\nme some ideas.
I'm thinking we should add\nmore mocktails to the menu.
I'm very VERY sorry you had to\ndeal with that...
I'm well aware that I have\ntrouble speaking kindly\nor subtly.
I'm with you on that one!\nThat's the right call,\nno matter how you slice it.
I'm worried it will get in the\nway of my true purpose.
I'm... not terrible, I think.
I've added a lot of mocktail\nrecipes to my repertoire.
I've already got my alias,\nby the way.
I've always been the kind of\nperson to want to stand next\nto the one I admire.
I've been a housewife for\na while now after meeting\nmy hubby, of course.
I've been going to Inokashira\nPark a lot to practice singing\nand playing at the same time.
I've been helping him\npack his things.
I've been looking up the\namount of calories in\ndifferent foods.
I've been taking secret notes\nfor some time now, haha.
I've been testing out\nrecording my flair bartending\npractice from various angles.
I've been thinking about\nstuff. Mind hearing me out?
I've been thinking...
I've been wondering...
I've been worried about my\nskin lately. I'm usually\ncareful with it, but still!
I've given it great thought.
I've got a report due soon for\none of my worst classes.
I've got it covered.|Who are you, my mom?
I've got to pass this time\nand restore my honor!
I've gotta let them decide\non their own what's best.
I've heard of people from my\nhomeland who made the trek to\nJapan in search of something.
I've heard there are tons\nof shops there!
I've never been all that great\nat talking to others.
I've never been into them.\nMaybe I should give them\na chance.
I've never had to ask\nsomeone for something\nlike this before.
I've never owned my own store,\nso I'm not sure.
I-It really is the real thing,\nI swear! Or I wouldn't ask\nyou to watch it with me.
If I didn't talk it out with\nyou, I'd still be struggling.
If I hadn't quit the team,\nthat could've been me\npracticing in the field.
If I have, it's thanks to you.
If I hear anything more from\nthem, I'll make sure you're\nthe first to know!
If I just change my attitude,\nthen maybe everything will\nstart sticking in my head?
If I want my customers to be\ntruly satisfied...
If I'm being honest, I'm not\ngood at holding my tongue...
If I'm going to be a Phantom\nThief...
If I'm happy with them,\nI'll let you try some.
If a menu's got fries, they'll\nalways end up on my tray.
If anything, it was a spirit\nof guidance, not luck.
If it's all true, that'd be\npretty incredible,\ndon't you think?
If not, then awesome!
If possible, I should\ninvestigate her life\npre-hiatus.
If so, then maybe Japanese\npeople have always been\nreluctant to hit the books...
If speaking my mind\nmakes someone hate me,\nthen I'll be the bad guy.
If that's that case, then...
If that's the case, I should\njust suck it up and accept it.
If there's anything I can do\nto help, just say the word!
If we rent the place out,\nLufel can finally eat his\nroast pork and stewed eggs.
If you could give me tips,\nI'd appreciate it...
If you don't get something,\nfeel free to ask me for help\nanytime.
If you don't mind,\nI hope you'll keep\nlending me an ear.
If you have any trouble,\nyou can always talk to\nthe neighbors, okay?
If you miss the hourly bus,\nyou'd better be prepared\nto get biking!
If you place four dolls with\ndifferent expressions in the\ncorners of a room at midnight...
If you say so.|She was cute.
If you see me there again,\nfeel free to say hi!
If you've got time later on,\nlet's discuss which ones to\ncheck out!
Imagine two bowls of ramen,\none's perfect, one's not.
In any case, let us not\nworry over such details!
In fact, I just finished doing\nit. I hope a demon appears.\nActually, maybe not...
In my idol research, I have\ndiscovered an incredibly\nenchanting individual.
In one of my lectures, I heard\nthat the Chinese first arrived\nin Japan centuries ago.
In other words, I wasn't\nseriously considering the\nperson I was talking to.
In other words, she is an\nemployee there.
In other words, the fate of an\nidol's career depends on them.
In other words, they've put\ntheir faith in me?
In places with convenience\nstores around practically\nevery corner...
In that case, forget about\nwhat I said back then!
Including what others saw in\nchoosing to settle here.
Intriguing, right? My senses\nare tingling... It's like I'm\nbeing drawn in...
Is it?|Did something happen?
Is she talking about how I get\nriled up like this?
Is that being childish!?
Is that how it works?|You just want to convert me.
Is that right?
Is that what people who don't\ndrink tend to prefer?
Is there any way to delete it?\nOh, I hate how all this stuff\nstays on your phone!
Is there anything you want to\ndo besides farming, Russet?
Is there someone you admire?|That's what "admire" means.
Isn't the world of\nhorticulture just so\ndeep and fascinating!
Issue is, my mom moved them\naround a bunch.
It can't be easy, right?
It definitely is.|Even indirectly...
It feels like you're clearly\nolder than me in spirit.
It felt as if both\nidols and fans shared\none heart and mind.
It got me going to a burger\nshop for the first time\nin what must be forever.
It happened back when\nI was a wee sprout!
It happens when foreign foods\nare introduced to a country,\nand locals adapt the flavors.
It happens.|Case closed!
It is I who should be\nthanking you.
It is pointless for\na concierge to sing\nher own praises.
It is required to fulfill our\ncontract. Please do not\nneglect it.
It is times like these when\none's loyalty is tested.
It looks super interesting.
It made a huge impact, huh?|Sounds unreal.
It made me curious to know\nwhat movies my other friends\nare watching.
It made me wonder whether that\nnuance exists in Japanese too.
It makes sense now. Thanks.
It might have grown into\na whole other issue\nif you weren't around.
It only took half my life...
It opens a gate to another\nworld. Or so they say...
It reminded me of the first\ntime I sung with my band.
It reminds me of when I\nwas younger and finally\nleaving home.
It seemed kinda mystical once\nI started thinking about it.
It seems many idols appear in\nthem before rising to fame.
It sounds like she's awfully\nbusy with practice, anyway.
It sure did!|No.
It took being on the receiving\nend of it to finally realize\nwhat I was doing.
It was a popular ghost story\nway back in the day.
It was a real nail-biter.\nThey eked out a draw\nsomehow...
It was funny.|You were cute.
It was honestly pathetic...
It was nothing, really.|I'm glad I could help.
It was only a matter of time\nuntil I harnessed my powers.
It was so CUTE!
It will take some time for\nhis change of heart to be\nreflected in reality...
It won't get them any closer\nto understanding where\nI'm coming from.
It would've been better if I'd\nfigured this all out before\nI came to study, sure.
It'd be cool to play with you\nsometime.
It'd help with your work.|Can't wait to see your moves.
It's Motoha!
It's a good thing I checked\nto be sure!
It's a little confusing, but I\nfind it real interesting.
It's a modern-day ghost story,\nbut about a dog-faced man,\nnot a man-faced dog!
It's a pretty interesting\nconnection, don't you think?
It's a promise!
It's a symbol of my resolve to\ntake music seriously from now\non!
It's about the dog-faced man\ncase I mentioned before.
It's all still boxed up right\nnow, though...
It's amazing that you're\nable to live alone at\nsuch a young age.
It's basically training that\nincorporates boxing\ntechniques...
It's because of you that I can\nstay positive
It's been a while since I read\nthat demon-summoning spell.
It's been getting real popular\nthese days. Want to go try\nsome together next time?
It's been quite some time\nsince I became your concierge.
It's been working great.\nMy sleep's never been better!
It's easier than it looks.|I guess practice paid off.
It's easy to go overboard\nwithout realizing.
It's fine, really!
It's fun talking with you.|Maybe you've changed.
It's fun to look this\nstuff up, you know?
It's fun!|I'm fine, I have friends.
It's giving me too many ideas.\nI want to try out everything.
It's good that you went.|You okay?
It's great that they get along\nso well, but it must be\ntough on you, {NAME2}-chan.
It's hard for me to figure out\nwhat to prioritize here.
It's hard to put into words.|Nothing in particular...
It's harder for me to just\nwing it and not give a damn.
It's high time I stepped up to\nyour expectations!
It's interesting to see things\nfrom that point of view.
It's just...
It's just... it was my first\ntime hearing strangers call\nthemselves fans of mine
It's like a nonstop punch to\nthe feels.
It's like that for everyone.|Act the way you wanna be seen.
It's like time just melts away\nthe minute I'm watching vids\nof other peoples' pets!
It's like we're living our\nbest lives every day!
It's like with no warning,\nsome random thought appears\nand totally consumes my brain.
It's like you say, Sensei.\nThis has been a good\nlearning experience for me.
It's new, but it's a little on\nthe small side. Besides...
It's no surprise that some\npeople dream of escaping\nto the countryside.
It's not a big deal or\nanything
It's not a dream.|It's okay to dream.
It's not an optical illusion?|It's probably been edited.
It's not as if I go round\nseasoning my coworkers'\nlunches at the office!
It's not for long, but our\nplace just feels so big when\nit's just me, you know?
It's not the closest one,\nbut they're selling cartons\nof eggs for 99 yen!
It's not wise to reveal your\ntrue name in enemy territory.
It's only fair if I tell you\nwhat I thought of you, too!
It's quite useful for online\ndata collection, too.
It's reassuring to hear you\nsay that, Sensei!
It's slander, and it's taking\na real toll...
It's surprising how there's\nso much more to common words\nthan we think, right?
It's the perfect place to go\nto busk it out, y'know?
It's the roasted pork recipe\nI mentioned before.
It's the same reason everyone\ntalks about Menaces.
It's true! There's a photo\nof a guy with a dog's head\ndriving a car!
Japan sure loves its vending\nmachines, doesn't it?
Japan takes that to a whole\nother level.
Japanese authors have always\nbeen good at making the\nmundane sound so interesting.
Japanese loanword, right?|Of course.
Japanese people have a\nreputation for being polite,\nand I think so too.
Just as people once found\ngods within nature,
Just because I'm a resident\nof this virtual world...
Just call me sensei.|Me? Teaching?
Just felt like sharing that.\nAnyway, catch ya soon.
Just get a late train slip.|Train's fault, so you're safe.
Just kidding. I'm responsible;\nI won't let it go to my head.
Just let me know when you have\nthe time.
Just picturing the numbers\non my next bank statement is\nmaking me depressed...
Just venting your feelings\nwon't help anything.
Just watch me!\nI don't need a new name to\nshow you how I've changed!
Just watch me. I'm doing this!
Kayo-san's been asking you for\nadvice on all kinds of stuff,\nright?
Keep talking...|Thanks, but no thanks.
Kinda strange, really.\nI'd eat all that meat...
Kinda weird, right?
Know what a phone charm is?
Knowing you as well as I do,\nI knew you wouldn't\ndisappoint!
Kotone-san, performing to\nthe song I chose...
Last week's math homework
Lately, I've been taking this\nboxercise class at the gym I'm\ngoing to.
Lately, I've been trying my\nhand at making a bunch of new\ncocktails and mocktails.
Lately, my mom's been\nasking about you.
Later!
Learning how to use it took\nsome time, but these modern\nphones are amazing, huh?
Leave it to me, partner.|Only if you pay.
Leek, dried sardines,\nbonito, kelp, garlic,\nginger, celery.
Left unchecked, however,\nit invites ruin upon oneself\nand others.
Lemme know if you\nfind more, yeah?
Lemme know when you've\nfinished watching it,\n{NAME2}.
Let me know when you've\ngot some time!
Let me know your other movie\nrecs too. We can catch a flick\non the big screen next time.
Let's ask Yamagoshi-san.\nMaybe this time Lufel can eat\nroast pork and stewed eggs.
Let's both give solo life\neverything we've got, ok?
Let's farm together forever.|I'd like to meet you IRL.
Let's go shopping\ntogether sometime!
Let's see. Well, the word for\n"study" in Japanese can mean\n"reluctance" in Chinese.
Let's take some pics\ntogether sometime, okay,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Light.|Heavy.
Like Motoha and\nmy teammates...
Like at a gym? I guess, but I\nfind it hard to stay motivated\nwhen working out alone...
Like us.|And how does Kotone feel?
Like what?|Lay a good one on me.
Like with the Sahara Desert,\n"Sahara" just means desert.
Like, soybeans?|Your code name?
Like, when you drink mocktails\nwith me, you have to go home\nbefore it's too late, right?
Listen to this,\n{NAME1}-san!
Live action is a door to\nsuccess for many hopeful\nactors and idols.
Look at me, forcing my own\nopinions onto others...
Look forward to my findings!\nHehehe.
Looks like I still have a ways\nto go.
Lucky for the guy, it turned\nout to be delicious and had\na great shelf life.
Made a group chat so we can\nget in touch easily!
Make sure you're eating\nenough, okay?
Making sure you give\na youngster the space\nthey need is hard...
Mandarins prefer\nwarmer climates.
Many of our regulars are\nfriends with the owner.
Mariyan?|Shiyurin?
Math class is so hard.\nNone of it's making any sense\nto me.
Maybe I was aiming too high\nwith the bar menu.
Maybe I'll take my hubby\non a date, and we can go\nto one together next time.
Maybe I'll try reaching out\nto some friends from my\nstudent days for a change.
Maybe all these jobs\nare keeping my eyes\nin peak condition...
Maybe an e-reader app?|Put some games on it.
Maybe he's taking a back seat?|He respects your independence?
Maybe hearing you play what\nyou like made me enjoy it even\nmore?
Maybe it's about not\ntrying too hard. Is that\nwhy it's good?
Maybe it's the same endless\ncycle regardless of age.
Maybe schoolwork is the\nsame then?
Maybe the other instruments\nare getting added in post, or\nyou're using a synth keyboard?
Maybe you'll even start\nbawling?
Me, I'd go for anything that\nkeeps me moisturized.
Meant to send it to my mom.
Met Pops the other day.\nIt's been forever.
Might I suggest taking on some\ntougher Trials from the Sea of\nSouls?
Might as well make the most\nof having the whole house\nto yourself, right?
Might grow some plants...
Mind if I ask you something?
Mind if I pick your brain?
Mind showing me again?\nWhen you have time, of course!
Mine aren't.|Take care!
Mint tea is lovely in the\nwarmer months, you know.
Modern photo booths amaze me!
Most of my repertoire consists\nof bar snacks. I don't cook at\nhome at all.
Most seem to grow out of it\nas they age.
Motoha didn't fail!
Move
Much like an object of\nworship, an idol embodies the\ndesires of their believers.
Must be lonely when all the\nfans who knew you are gone...
Must be to make them\nremember what it's like\nto feel real wonder.
Must've been a fake grimoire.|Maybe you read it wrong?
Musubi and I can share a meal\nsince we're at her place!
Musubi's told me so many\nstories about her life\nin the countryside!
My apologies. My emotions\ngot the better of me.
My belly flab's all gone!\nIt feels incredible.
My eyes clearly lack the\nability to see through such\nillusions. I must train more.
My eyesight was still pretty\ngood back when I was\nplaying baseball...
My first impression\nof you was...
My goal... Yeah, you're right.
My head's been in the clouds\nlately. I need to get it\ntogether.
My hubby left on a work trip\ntoday too. I'm all alone.
My hubby's still out\non his work trip, so...
My impulse to speak my mind\ntakes the wheel.
My mom's on the night shift,\nso she might not be around.
My place is nothing special,\nbut if you really want to...
My research has led me to\na popular title called\nPhoenix Ranger Featherman.
My sincerest apologies for\nmy loss of composure.
My, my... I really can't\ncompete with you.
My, you sound confident!
N-No, I'm not!\nI'm not scared,\nit's just...
Nah, I mean regular soybeans.
Nah, forget it. I'm the adult\nhere. I can't be relying on\nyou all the time.
Nah.
Nah. It's not like my account\nis in danger of hitting zero\nor anything. It's just...
Near my house.|In Shibuya.
Needless to say, I hope you\nwill exercise due caution.
Nevertheless, please keep this\na secret from Naruru.
Next time, I would like you to\nreattempt the spell with the\npose for me.
Nice.|What did you get?
Night shifts, you know?|Sorry, I can't divulge that.
Nighty night!
Nngh... I need to pull myself\ntogether.
No clue.|A handkerchief!
No doubt.|Totally.
No idea. I just heard someone\nyell it out.
No matter. Another time, then.
No problem. I'll be at my\nusual spot if you're free.
No problem.|Lemme get back to you.
No wonder they're\nall falling apart!
No, I didn't.|What were they talking about?
No, actually I continued\nreading the book after that.
No, no, it's just with an\nindie label. No big break for\nme yet.
No, thank you for stopping by!
No. In fact...
None of our ideas stood out.\nNot really, anyway.
None of us can stomach it,\nnot even the guys who\ncooked it!
Noodles count as a\nstaple food, yeah?
Nope! It's fall.\nOnly four letters!
Nope, train was just late.\nJust my luck lol.\nActually slept like a log.
Nope.|I'd go for it.|Not sure.
Normally, I just sit and\nlet her talk my ear off.
Not a chance.|You've piquant-ed my interest.
Not a lot of girls trying out\nfor catcher these days.
Not everything is spicy,\nyou know! Different regions\nhave their own flavors.
Not exactly next door\nneighbors, when you\nthink about it.
Not gonna lie,\nI kinda want to!
Not here in the virtual world?
Not in particular.|I have a couple products.
Not only do I talk straight,\nbut I don't care what\npeople think of me.
Not sure. There's so much\nmore I need to learn about\nthis country.
Not that I know of.|Who's asking?
Not virtually,\nI mean in real life.
Nothin' out of the ordinary.
Nothing wrong with crying.|Let's get stronger together.
Now I can face my Mama\nwith pride, and tell her\nmy studies are going A-OK!
Now I feel like I've gained\nweight from all the\ntaste-testing I'm doing.
Now I want to take even\nmore photos, y'know?
Now her idol career shines\nbrighter than ever.
Now we can finally start\nsearching for the next Palace,\nright?
Of course I know the\nbasics of numerology,\nbut equations...
Of course I'll go.|Can Lufel come too?
Of course it is.|If you have no regrets, sure.
Of course you were.|Where'd this all come from?
Of course! Even I was\na child once, you know.
Of course! I haven't been\ndoing all of this for nothing.
Of course!|I've been practicing at home.
Of course, if you want to talk\nabout real life, I'm all ears!
Of course, it's always easy to\ntalk to you because you're so\nmature, {NAME2}-chan.
Of course, parents are never\nable to fully understand how\ntheir children feel either...
Of course, that may simply be\nmy own misconception.
Of course, you'd never be able\nto care for an animal if you\ncan't even care for plants.
Of course.|Take your time.
Oh btw, I forgot to ask\nearlier, but...
Oh come on! You're supposed\nto agree to join me!
Oh my...
Oh no... I was trapped in an\nendless cream soda mind loop!
Oh right. That makes sense.
Oh yeah!\nA lady of class always remains\ncalm and collected.
Oh yeah, I heard riding the\ntrain all the way to Hakata\nis brutal on the ole keister.
Oh yeah, she did say\nshe'll get some tickets\nto the competition!
Oh! Bass is pretty hard\nthough! That's impressive.
Oh! Guess it went well then.
Oh! That's kids these days\nfor you.
Oh, I guess I answered my own\nquestion already, huh?
Oh, I guess they're a little\nold-school.
Oh, I had a feeling you'd\nsay that!
Oh, I see! If it's a synth\nkeyboard, then I guess you\nfour could manage with that.
Oh, I see!|I forgot that was a thing.
Oh, I see. Ping me next time\nyou're available.
Oh, I see. Same here,\nactually.
Oh, I see... Let's do it\nanother time, then.
Oh, I think you might be onto\nsomething there. Thanks!
Oh, I'll use the one we played\nwhen I would step up to bat.
Oh, I'm being a bit of a\nwet blanket now, aren't I?\nSorry, forget I said anything!
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have\nrevealed myself?
Oh, and did you eat today?\nMake sure you're eating\nwell-balanced meals, okay?
Oh, and you know what the\nrecord company rep said to me?
Oh, but I do want to go\nwith my hubby first...
Oh, good idea! All three of us\nfor the next study session.
Oh, great idea. Apparently\nyou can even read magazines\non your phone now!
Oh, it was just a thought.\nMaybe I'm totally\noff the mark.
Oh, no, it's nothing serious.\nMy body's just aching\nall over.
Oh, of course! Your phone\ncase! Yeah, that does seem\nlike the trend these days.
Oh, okay.\nMaybe some other time.
Oh, really!? Phew, maybe I'll\ndo the same, then.
Oh, really?\nI'm sorry about that.
Oh, right! I'll take you to\none of our suppliers next\ntime.
Oh, right. The music club came\nto support the game, too!
Oh, sorry! I'm the one who's\nfalling short here, I know.
Oh, stop it. Although\nI suppose a little praise\nis nice... Heh.
Oh, sure. Yeah, I guess that\nmakes sense.
Oh, that'd work!\nI bet I'll find someone\nwho wants it!
Oh, the luster of youth!\nI'm jealous that your skin\ncan look so good.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
Oh, you! Always telling jokes,\n{NAME2}-chan!
Oh, you're always so smooth.
Oh, you're so pure!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan!\nAre you free?
Oh-ho! I thought so.
Oh. My bad.
Oh... The demon didn't appear,\nand I thought a lucky spirit\nwould be more useful anyway.
Oh? So I was right.
Ohmigosh, this takes me back!\nIt's like I've actually turned\nback the clock or something.
Okay, I'll let you know again\nnext time.
Okay, but!
Okay, see you around.
Okay, sure.|If you must.
Okay. See you guys on\nthe roof.
Okay. See you guys tonight at\nHeritage Kitchen then!
Okay...
On my phone.|Thinking about life.
On my way.|See you there.
On that note, see you\ntomorrow!
On the other hand, mandarins\ngrow well in warm climates!
Once I figured it out,\nour study session was\na breeze!
Once she absorbs a technique,\nMotoha never forgets it.
Once we recreate my hometown\nin the virtual world...
Once you're a grown-up though,\nwe can drink the night away.
One step closer to adulthood.|Empathy is important.
Ones by famous directors!|Comedies all the way.
Ones that make your\nskin smooth, improve\ncirculation, etc.
Ooh, I could see how\na bright, fragrant bath\ncould lift your mood.
Ooh, I like it!\nI bet it'd even help\nspruce up dinner!
Ooh, I'd really like to try\nyour cooking some time.
Ooh, how mysterious!\nI'm actually pretty jealous.
Ooh, maybe I should become\nyour full-time stylist next!
Oooh, I'm so excited!
Oooh, so that's what\nthey're called! Filters!
Oooh, that's where\nMusubi works!
Oops, so I guess you were\nthe one looking after me?
Or at least, I think so.
Or perhaps what we see now\nis his true character.
Or rather, it is guaranteed\nto succeed.
Or so I'd like to say, but...
Our class president is\ntransferring at the end\nof the month...
Our contract is proceeding\nsmoothly.
Our keyboardist works hard.|I don't really know either.
Our purpose is to open\nthe eyes of the masses!
Our telepathic powers are sure\nto awaken in time!
P.S.
Papa was the one who insisted\nI study abroad...
Pay no mind to\nthose messages!
People still ferment stuff.\nHell, we're getting better\nat it.
People would attach a bunch\nof them to their flip phones.
Perhaps I'm complimenting you\nway too much!
Perhaps that is a way of\nstealing desires...
Perhaps, but that is also\nentirely thanks to you.
Phoenix Ranger Featherman\napparently has many\ninstallments.
Please give live action a try\nwhen you have the chance.
Please ignore my prior\ncareless remarks.
Please recite along.
Please use the Phantom Idols\nto their fullest potential.
Please!
Please, I'm begging you.\nLet me copy your homework!
Plus, I'd be at a disadvantage\nif I didn't know the rules of\nbaseball.
Plus, apartments that let you\nplay music indoors don't come\ncheap...
Pops says the latter is\njust right.
Pretty amazing, huh?
Promise you'll have your first\ndrink with me?
Proud of you!|Queen of all bartenders!
Put it on my phone case.|Attach it to something else.
Raising a child was so much\nwork. I was relieved when\nit was over, but...
Ready when you are.
Really!? Thank you so much!
Really? I didn't know that!\nI'll give that a go tonight.
Really? I had no idea.|Aww, I want cheap burgers.
Really? I was expecting you\nto say no! Aww, I'm so happy!\nJust leave it to me!
Really? I'm glad to hear that.
Really? That makes me feel\nbetter.
Really? That's too bad. Maybe when\nyou have some time, okay?
Really? Wow, luckyyy!
Really? You couldn't?
Really? You're a lifesaver!
Really?|I don't get it.
Recently, I've been watching\ntons of dance videos online.
Remember that bit you\nfreestyled in our last jam\nsesh together?
Remember that recording\nequipment I blew my\npaycheck on?
Remember what I told you\nabout the word "soy"?
Right on my phone case.|My notebooks or my planner.
Right!
Right! He was super happy\nto sign one for me.
Right, since alcohol isn't\nthe focus, I could serve the\nmocktails as part of a meal.
Right, so...
Right, you do need some\nspecific ones. I'll take you\nshopping next time!
Right, you must be pretty\nbusy. No rush, just let me\nknow when you have time.
Right. You can't grow up if\nall you care about is whether\nor not you think it's fair.
Right... I guess I'll start by\nuncovering its mystery.
Right... I guess that\nmakes sense.
Right... yeah. There is\nsomething that I've been\nmulling over.
Right? Glad you agree.
Right? I was thinking the\nsame!
Right? Thanks!
Romance.|You should try horror.
Rumor has it there's an\nabandoned building near\nour school that's cursed.
Said it's been forever since I\ntalked about a classmate.
Salutations, {NAME2}-sama.
Say, {NAME1}-kun,\nwhat's your take on\nspicy food?
Secret frames?|Codes?
See youuuuuu!
Seems like you and Leo-chan\nare getting along well, hm?
Sell it at a flea market!|Donate it to your old team.
Shall we watch it later?\nWe need to see what\nit's all about!
She asked them to do a studio\nrecording of the song.
She said you're a\nhigh schooler, Russet!
She wants to be a pro player\nwhen she grows up!
She was shocked.
She wore not her con caf\xe9\nattire. Instead, it was a\nconvenience store uniform.
She's not the real deal?|Does that count as an idol?
She's still getting the same\nnasty comments as before...
She's treating me to dinner!
Shoot! Did we wake you up?
Shouldn't I just make what\nthe customers want to eat?
Shouldn't take too long.|Probably tomorrow?
Sign up now and get\na free plot of land!
Since I decided to become a\nPhantom Thief, I've been doing\nsome thinking...
Since I've been training a lot\nlately...
Since our visit to Akihabara,\nI have looked into "concept\ncaf\xe9s."
Since we're the chosen ones...
Sleep well, everyone.\nSee you at school.\nGood night.
Smartphones are so handy,\nright? You can watch videos\nand record videos of your own.
So I ended up as the interim\nclass president.
So I guess things haven't\nchanged. Okay, onto my\nbudget planner they go!
So I imagine I've got plenty\nof cringey moments ahead\nof me\u2014and failures, to boot.
So I made sure to focus all\nmy positive energy into it\nbefore handing it off.
So I need a cup of tea\nto force my gears to\nstart turning.
So I think the purpose of\nchosen ones like us...
So I wanted to say thanks.
So I was out busking in\nShibuya
So I was performing in Shibuya\ntoday, right?
So I was thinking about taking\nup some kind of hobby myself.
So I was thinking of using\nyour style as a point of\nreference for my new look.
So I was wondering if\nyou might be able to\ninstruct me
So I've decided to get back\ninto exercising.
So I've kinda been wondering\nhow you go about it...
So doing it all in one trip\nwouldn't be much different\nto two trips. Hmm...
So even though I'm done with\nthe lyrics, I'll have to put\nthe melody writing on hold...
So he opened the shop back up.
So how about it? Wanna form a\nduo and debut with me?
So if you have the time,\ndo you think you could be\nmy workout buddy?
So it's even more tiring...
So let's chat via IMs\nfrom time to time\nas well!
So make sure to call me\nPrince of Darkness\nfrom now on, Hero of Light!
So many things to buy...
So now they're in the market\nfor some taste testers...
So that's how kids these days\nthink about things...
So the day has finally come...|Now the fun begins!
So there's another way!?\nYou've got to tell me\nabout it!
So tomorrow after school.
So we'll get to eat both\nPops's and Masa-san's ramen.\nWanna go?
So you do? Now that's\nquite something.
So you might be wondering\nhow we're eating together...
So you understand, then?|Exactly, Prince of Darkness.
So {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\ndo you come to Shibuya a lot?
So {PLAYER_NAME}-kun...
So! I've saved up quite a bit\nfrom my part-time jobs.
So, I asked them about making\na song to cheer on Kotone-san.
So, I got all the devices\nhooked up to start composing\nand recording.
So, I saw this ad on TV.
So, I tried to remember how I\nwent about things back then.
So, I'm still working at\nthat diner in Shibuya.
So, about that song I asked\nthe music club to perform\nfor Kotone-san.
So, that thing you taught me\nthe other day... I can't seem\nto get it right on my own.
So, you were able to\nsense my emotions?
So, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nabout your band...
So... about what Musubi\nsaid about you being\na high schooler...
So... it's that tasty, huh.
Soda's got you trapped.|Wanna dash to a diner?
Some of them only use the\nupper body. Maybe I could use\nthem in my flair bartending.
Some of us would even hide\nphotos of our crush inside\nour phone's battery case.
Someone outside the classroom\nrandomly yelled...
Something I've never tried\nbefore, hm? I wonder what\nthat could be.
Something from the heart!|One that'll pump her up.
Something like... working out?
Something refreshing.|Something sweet.
Sometimes I think about you...
Sometimes, when I'm working on\na guitar lick or my backlog of\nhousework
Songs that pump me up.|Chill beats.
Soon enough, Naruru will\njoin their ranks...
Sooo, I just had to think\nabout how she took\nthe information in.
Sorry I'm late!
Sorry about the joke.|My bad.
Sorry for bringing up such a\nspicy, uh, dicey proposition!
Sorry for suddenly logging out\nlast time.
Sorry for the sudden text.\nDo you have a second?
Sorry for the weird question!\nSee ya tomorrow!
Sorry if that was random!\nBut no real reason...
Sorry, just wanted to update\nyou. Thanks for listening.
Sorry. I know this is totally\ncoming out of nowhere...
Sorry... I'm good at reading,\nbut speaking is a bit rough.
Sorry... I'm just venting\nmore than anything.
Sorry...|I will, I will.
Sounds fun.|I'm kinda busy.
Sounds good to me!|Just take it slow, okay?
Sounds like he was admitted.\nHe is pretty old, after all.
Speaking of rehearsals though,\nyou've got some mad tambourine\nskills, too.
Speaking of the park
Speaking of which, Japan is\nchock-full of hot springs.
Spoke to a guy from class...
Squee!
Squee!|SQUEE!!!
Staying on top of everything\nwhen it's just you is tougher\nthan I imagined.
Still, I have full confidence\nthat your skill is not to\nblame.
Still, can you even\nbelieve it?
Still, it's a hospital.\nI can't just barge in\non him.
Still, thanks for making this\nwhole thing into a fun memory.
Still, there must be\nsome way, right?
Still, when it comes to\ntalking about nothing,
Such a task is elementary for\nyou. Be diligent.
Summer?|Winter?
Support Naruru further,\nand our contract will proceed\nswimmingly.
Sure am, haha! But I'm glad to\nhear you say that, thanks.
Sure am.|My homeroom teacher is.
Sure am.|Not really.
Sure can!|Define "cook."
Sure do.|Yeah, it's close to my school.
Sure thing.|Reply later
Sure!
Sure!|I'll think about it.|Thanks, but...
Sure, I can help.|Sorry, kinda busy...
Sure, can't go wrong with\nice cream or almond jelly.
Sure, no problem.|I dunno...
Sure...|Well, I'm never late...
Sure.|Let me think about it.
Sure.|Tell me.
Sure.|Wouldn't call it a side dish.
Take any good pictures?|Use any good filters?
Take it slow and steady. That\nis what is most important.
Taking pics with my hubby\nwas fun, but I don't have\nanywhere to display them.
Talkin' to you made me realize\nthat all this time, all I had\nto do was just wing it.
Talking to you never fails to\nmotivate me.
Th-That's the name of\nmy old guild! The Office!
Thank yooouuu! I'd feel much\nmore comfortable using one\nwith someone younger with me.
Thank you again for your\nassistance with Naruru.
Thank you for asking. I got\nhome safe and I'm about to\nturn in.
Thank you for the\nrecommendation!
Thank you! It's just a small\nindie label, but still.
Thank you! Sorry this\nis so short notice...
Thank you.\nThat's very kind of you.
Thanks a lot. I'll let the\nmusic club know!
Thanks again! I'll get back to\nyou when I'm done watching.
Thanks for always listening to\nmy randomness.
Thanks for always putting up\nwith me. I hope I'm not\nannoying you.
Thanks for everything! Let's\ngive it our all tomorrow, too!
Thanks for listening to me.\nI'll catch you later.
Thanks for listening to my\nwhining. I'll let you know\nwhen my gear arrives!
Thanks for listening.
Thanks for replying though!\nI was so terribly bored!
Thanks for the show.|Looking forward to next time!
Thanks for your input!
Thanks so much!\nYou've been a huge help!
Thanks!
Thanks! But Motoha's the one\nwho put in all the work.
Thanks! I'll be waiting\noutside the diner.
Thanks! Look forward to my\nnext song, okay!
Thanks! Night!
Thanks! You're a lifesaver!
Thanks, I'll give it a little\nmore thought, then.
Thanks, I'll see\nwhat's around.
Thanks, Mom.|Don't worry, I'm fine.
Thanks, Motoha.
Thanks, but maybe save the\ncongrats for Motoha.
Thanks, you've been a\nbig help!
Thanks, {NAME2}-chan!\nI'll message you again later.
Thanks.
Thanks. I'll return the\nfavor sometime.
Thanks... Now I can finally\nget to the song writing part!
Thanks.|I appreciate it.
Thanks.|You think so?
That alone is the\nunshakeable truth.
That became soy in English.\nIt's why we call 'em soybeans.
That counts as studying!|There's more important things.
That first time you listened\nto me sing in the park
That is a concierge's duty.\nI will persevere.
That is pretty incredible!|At the hospital?
That is really sudden.|Did something happen?
That makes it a pretty\ndifficult instrument, I think.
That means one for you too,\nof course. We should go\nsee it! Together, I mean.
That means you finished it,\nright, {NAME2}?
That only supports her\nargument that I'm childish!
That reminds me...\nYou enjoy sports and stuff,\nright {NAME2}-kun?
That reminds me.\nSome of my furniture,\nand even tools are broken.
That said, we're not a\nrestaurant. We can't make\nanything too fancy.
That settles it! We'll meet at\nHeritage Kitchen tonight!
That so?
That sounds fun.|I'd like to try.
That sounds wonderful!\nAll that color, right outside\nmy window!
That villainous producer had\na complete change of heart.
That was fast!\nWhat about you, {NAME2}?
That way, I sure won't forget\nwhat I've learned.
That you might be forcing\nyourself to spend time\nwith me.
That you seem pretty...\nabsent-minded?
That you were interesting.|Wow, she's peppy.
That'd be great!|Can't today, sorry...
That'd be quite the trip.|Both would be no mean feat.
That's a relief, though.
That's all real world\nbusiness, so I'll ask\nMusubi to go!
That's all right, it doesn't\nneed to be now. Just when\nyou have time, Sensei.
That's deep.|You think so?
That's due the day after\ntomorrow, right?
That's exactly it! Children\nnever really get how much their\nparents love them.
That's exactly why fermented\nfoods are cool, if you ask me.
That's fine, no pressure.\nIf you happen to have time,\nyou know where I am.
That's good to hear.|Will they be enough?
That's great!|Who?
That's great!|You're one hard worker.
That's great.
That's greeeat! I'm so happy.\nThose are actually pretty\nnice pieces, you know.
That's how I used\nto think, anyway.
That's how you get the\nmarinade to taste so good.
That's it?
That's okay for now.|Focus on conveying your thoughts.
That's okay, it doesn't have\nto be right now. I'll be at my\nusual spot if you're free.
That's okay, just when you\nhave time. I'm sure you're\nbusy with other things, too.
That's one worry down for\nole Yaoling. Thanks a bunch!
That's probably why I tend to\nbe a bit too watchful when it\ncomes to you.
That's random.|What're you talking about?
That's really nice of you.|I'm sure they'll be thrilled.
That's right, you bought\na desk, didn't you? You must\nlike handiwork? Cool!
That's the right thing to do.|You're a model fan.
That's the same thing as\ngiving up and running from\nthe conversation.
That's the spirit, Sensei!\nIt'll be a great experience,\nfor sure.
That's too bad.\nLet's do it another time then!
That's too bad.\nMaybe another time!
That's true. I guess every\ninstrument just takes\npractice.
That's what I'm wondering.
That's what it means to\nbe the one having to watch\na young one leave the nest.
That's why I can't help but\nfind it so incredible.
That's why I started working\nout not too long ago.
That's why he was\nso surprised, huh.
The "Erimo" in Cape Erimo\nmeans "cape" in Ainu.
The basil grew very well.
The best bowl is just\na means to an end.
The biggest thing about the\ntype of person I want to be...
The cameras are way better\nthan the digital cameras\nwe had back in the day.
The coach and everyone\non the team invited me\nto come watch.
The demon could manifest here\nat any moment...
The eggs they sell in this\ncountry are safe to eat raw.
The fan appreciation event\nwas truly splendid.
The girl named Narumi referred\nto her establishment as an\n"idol con caf\xe9."
The gym has other courses too.\nThey're so much better than\njust running on a treadmill!
The information age sure\nmade it hard to separate\nfact from fiction.
The ingredients and seasonings\nare a bit different from\nChinese food here in Japan.
The line cooks went all out,\nand made some crazy dishes.
The noodles and soup\nwere nothing special.
The old man who ran\nthe place told me how\nto make the marinade.
The only thing that mattered\nto me was...
The other day, I happened to\nsee Naruru.
The other day, she even asked\nme to bring you along.
The pay's gotta be good.|Gotta be easy work.
The performers hid their\nfaces, so I could not tell who\nthey were.
The person with the\nhead of a dog!
The picture just overlapped\nthe driver and his dog.
The process of fusion and\nskill inheritance undoubtfully\ndemonstrates its complexity...
The ramen I just had went\nheavy on the fat.
The reason I can strive so\nhard now is because of the\nperson I admire.
The reviews say you'll be\ncaught in an endless cycle\nof tears and laughter.
The roast pork?\nWhenever you want.
The salt incident\nI mentioned earlier...
The same concept applies to\nsupporting one's idol.
The savings aren't that much.|Getting there costs money too.
The second time, I won't let\nit dissolve completely.
The strays that live there\nhave started coming over to\nlisten to my songs.
The telltale signs of\nan oversleeper. But hey,\nthat's why we're friends.
The thing about being a mom is\nthat you start worrying over\nkids who aren't yours, too.
The thing is... I can't get\nthat lick you played out of\nmy head.
The thought just popped\ninto my head, so I thought\nI'd let you know. Take care!
The time has come, {NAME1}.\nA new threat has emerged,\nand I'm going to gather intel.
The type to protect and defend\nwhat I believe in?
The uneven distribution\nof flavor is what made it\nso delicious.
The way you say something\nis important, of course.
The what?|Sounds kind of familiar.
The words are so small\nand hard to read though...\nIs it time I got glasses?
The world's spinning round\nand round!
Their anniversary's coming up\ntoo, so it's good timing.
Their names end with -man.|They're called Rangers.
Then I guess I'll have to\ncome up with something\nnext time!
Then I shall await you\nin front of the Velvet Room.
Then I wish for you to\naccompany me next time.
Then I'll see you online!
Then it was my turn to answer,\nbut I didn't know what to say.
Then it's a whole other flight\nor boat ride to the islands...
Then there's all the bugs...
Then you might not log on much\nduring exams.
Then, this is a bit\nembarrassing, but...
There are all sorts of egg\ndishes where I come from.
There are miraculous things\nto be found everywhere\nyou look.
There are so many flavors and\nrecipes I want to try out.
There is another ritual I want\nto try next time, though.
There is currently an outbreak\nof potato moles! For those\nof you with farms, be careful.
There is much depth to taking\na photo with your idol.
There was an article\nabout Kotone-san.
There was even a Chinese\nsettlement in the Hakata ward\nof Kyushu 1000 years ago!
There was this one time we had\nto perform something right out\nof The Arabian Nights.
There was this really cool guy\nwhen I was out running this\nmorning.
There's a huge difference with\nhow others see me and how I\nsee myself.
There's a huge sale at the\nsupermarket right now!
There's a new movie out on the\nstreaming service I signed\nup to.
There's actually a whole ritual\nbehind it.
There's more where that came\nfrom if you're interested!
There's no point in playing\nthe blame game.
There's no turning back!\nBehold! The new Yui is here!
There's no way I can sum up\na major life question in\n50 words or less.
There's so many of them,\nthough... I wonder if there\nare any good ones.
There's someplace I'd like\nto go with you. If you\nhave the time, of course.
There's something I wanted to\nask you about. Do you have\nsome time to spare?
There's something bothering\nme, I guess...
There's something\nI would really appreciate\nyour help with.
They act as an idol's mentor\nand key partner.
They all go down smoothly.
They always have. Though that\ncat from last time at the park\nwas one I see pretty often.
They brought it to Europe as\n"soya" in the 17th century.
They came out perfect!\nI took them with my hubby!
They didn't work out?|Hey, it happens.
They even adjust the size\nof your eyes and the length\nof your legs now!
They have Chinatowns not only\nin Yokohama, but Kobe and\nNagasaki, too.
They held a contest for their\nhot n' spicy original menu.
They may both be fruits,\nbut their needs are different!
They messaged me earlier\ntelling me how nerve-racking\nit was.
They must be the ones\nto decide how to enjoy\ntheir meal.
They really have an app\nfor everything now, too.\nI can't believe it!
They told me they were fans!
They were talking about dating\nyour best friend.
They're all old people too.\nI'm glad we're getting more\ncustomers younger than me.
They're even more convenient!|They're easy to use.
They're no use to me anymore.\nI need to buy new ones!
They're nothing like\nthe booths we had when\nI was growing up.
They're perfect.
They're so much bigger than\nthe ones I remember using.
Things got tense between us.
Things have come full circle.|History repeats itself.
Think you could come along\nwith me today...?
This again...?|I wouldn't know.
This clearly requires further\ninvestigation.
This is a message from\nthe admin of Harvest\nWorld Online.
This is to better understand\nyou and other humans.
This might take a while. Could\nwe meet outside in a bit?
This reminds me a lot\nof what we used to do\nwhen I was at school!
This requires further\ninvestigation. I'll let you\nknow if I find anything.
This too is proof of your\ntremendous growth.
This whole thing with\nYukimi-san...
This world is full\nof curiosities...
Those are their nicknames.\nPlease memorize them.
Those bamboo shoots I made\nthe other day...
Those people just love talking\nabout dating, you know.
Though I am a Sichuan girl.\nThat tongue-numbing heat\nis right up my alley.
Though I do not loathe\nthe notion.
Though there are some things\nI've felt like wanting to do\none day!
Though they may be products\nof cognition, they possess the\nstrength of a Phantom Thief.
Time to enjoy a nice, ice-cold\ncream soda!
Time to experiment.|The wonders of fermentation.
To further our contract,\nplease learn to be more\nlike her.
To possess desire without\nyielding to it... That is my\nsincere wish for you.
To think someone sealed away\nthe right food for a while and\ninvented a tasty snack... Wow!
To think that our faces would\nend up on live TV! What a\ngreat find.
Tomoko just told me\nthe same thing.
Tomoko said I'm still like a\nkid sometimes.
Too bad, but no worries. Let's go some\nother time, okay?
Too bad... It was an apple.
Totally relatable,\nif you ask me.
Try Akihabara.|Just get 'em online.
Trying to decide on which song\nto perform was tough.
Turned out better than I ever\nthought they would.
Turns out there are\nloads of them.
Ugh, I can't believe myself...
Ugh, I can't take it anymore!
Ugh, complaining to you\ndoesn't get me anywhere.
Uh oh, I think I'm gonna be\nlate for school.
Uh, I guess I still don't\ncompletely get it.
Uh, it's due tomorrow.|Bad news...
Uh, okay.|It's kinda short notice...
Um... Well, I can't play\nanymore, right?
Um... You know what, forget\nI said anything! I'm asking\ntoo much of you.
Umm, that's top secret.
Understood. Do let me know if\nyou are interested, should you\nnot have other arrangements.
Until recently, I've always\nspent my free time hanging\nwith friends.
Until then, I can only\ncontinue to support Naruru\nas a fan.
Very well. I shall be at my\nusual place, so just let me\nknow if you're interested.
Very well. I shall do so\non the next occasion.
Wait, don't just apologize!
Wait, is that really how\npeople see me?
Wait, no! I didn't mean it\nlike that!
Wait, what about your\nhomework?
Wait.
Walking around the city\nmade me realize something...
Want to try Harvest World\nOnline? It's free to play!
Warming up your feet helps.|Try eating dinner early.
Was hoping to ask you a favor.
Wasn't sure what they meant\nby authentic Chinese food\nthe first time I heard it.
Watching a cast of young,\ninexperienced actors
Watching videos online.|Mobile games.
We all even had to make\nmatching costumes.\nIt took a lot of work.
We chosen ones are embroiled\nin a never-ending battle to\nstay informed, so to speak.
We chosen ones must strive\nto fulfill our purpose\nhowever we can!
We did it!|So the change of heart worked.
We have to do all these quick\nmoves, but it's super fun!
We must search for intel in\nprint and online ensure our\nknowledge is kept up-to-date.
We need aliases.
We need cover stories to\nprotect our real identities.
We should all eat lunch\ntogether sometime!
We should have an emotional\nendurance contest to see who\ncan last the longest!
We still have a ways to go\nbefore that, though!
We'd stick them all over these\nspecial photo albums we bought\nor trade them with each other.
We'll be sure to bring you\nback some souvenirs, so look\nforward to it.
We're always discussing food!
We're talking about pets here!\nI suppose you do still have to\nraise them, but still...
We've become acquainted as I\ncontinue to visit Naruru.
We've just arrived at the\nairport.
Well I managed to find\nthat same image again.
Well now I want to try even\nharder!
Well then, it seems my support\nhas been worthwhile.
Well then, let's focus on\nexpanding our fields!
Well, I can say for sure that\nyou'd never do anything bad.
Well, I couldn't tell.|Maybe training might help?
Well, I guess someone your age\nwouldn't know any different.\nAnother sign of the times...
Well, I was wearing my\ntracksuit, so I don't know if\nI want to show you that...
Well, I'm glad I'm not the\nonly one...
Well, Masa-san's stoppin' by\ntonight to celebrate Pops's\nrecovery.
Well, apparently a pro\nbaseball player from\nway back is there!
Well, apparently she uploaded\nit to a video site, and that's\nhow the record label found me.
Well, either way. Thanks for\nall the advice! I'll message\nyou again later, okay?
Well, it's all here now!
Well, it's definitely not\nas convenient.
Well, it's very inconvenient\nfor school kids who don't\nhave a driver's license!
Well, seems like my desire to\nlook after something hasn't\ncompletely gone away.
Well, since I asked...
Well, someone has it\nfigured out! I could learn\nfrom your example.
Well, we are close in age.|We're both guys, so...
Well, {NAME2}'s house is\nclose to the shop.
Well... Yeah, there's some\nstuff that I don't do anymore.
Welp, I'm off to bed too then.\n'Night!
Welp, wish me luck, Sensei!
Wh-What in the world?
Whaaat!? No, but this is about\ngetting a good deal!
What I'm after isn't available\nnearby, you see. Wanna come\nwith me?
What a cultured woman you are.|How far will you go?
What a great day!
What about the Hero of Light?\nHaha, I like it.\nIt's perfect...

What dish would you choose to\nend a yakiniku course on?
What do kids these days even\ndo with the pictures they\ntake at photo booths anyway?
What do you do in your spare\ntime, {NAME1}-kun?
What do you mean,\n"surprisingly"!?
What do you mean?|Squee!
What do you say,\n{NAME1}-kun?\nThink you can take the heat?
What do you think about me!?
What do you think about when\nyou're playing bass?
What do you think would work\nfor cheering on Kotone-san?
What do you think\nof "Meow 3 Stars"\nfor a unit name?
What does it mean to "admire"?
What does that mean?|You have a ways to go?

What's this recipe for?|Is this a shopping list?
What's wrong?|"Salutations"?
What's wrong?|Did something happen?
Whatever I feel like!|Well, I'm always free to chat.
Whatever I feel like...
Whatever, I'll just try some\nand find out! Thank you!
Wheeeeee!!!
When I was workin',\nI'd bring up customers\nand coworkers.
When I'm feeling down
When did you come to enjoy\nfarming this much?
When everyone was on break\ntoday...
When in Japan, do as\nthe Japanese do, right!?
When we first met,\nwhat did you think of me?
When we performed that new\nsong, one of the fans took a\nvideo on her phone, right?
When you're really trying to\nfix a problem, whose fault\nit is doesn't matter.
When's Miyazawa's change of\nheart supposed to happen?
Where I'll land when\nthe dust settles.

Work hard, eat hard!\nTwo birds with one stone!
Works for me.|You all good now?

Yeah, fair enough. It's easier\nsaid than done, right?
Yeah, it sure is.
