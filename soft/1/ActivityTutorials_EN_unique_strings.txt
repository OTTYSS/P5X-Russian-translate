<color=#FF423F>Berserk Bots</color> have been hacked, and their orders were overwritten to <color=#FF423F>destroy the King Bot</color>.\n<color=#FF423F>If the King Bot is destroyed, you will fail the challenge</color>, so be sure to protect the King Bot.
<color=#FF423F>Berserk Bots</color> have been programmed to <color=#FF423F>destroy the King Bot</color>.\nWhen the <color=#FF423F>King Bot</color> moves, the <color=#FF423F>Berserk Bots</color> will automatically adjust their route.\nUse this to your advantage to defeat the enemies.
<color=#FF423F>Berserk Bots</color> will stop moving if their route to the <color=#FF423F>King Bot</color> is blocked.\nUse this to your advantage to complete the challenge.

<color=#FF423F>Firewalls</color> are unable to be crossed.\nYou will need to go around the <color=#FF423F>Firewall</color> in order to proceed.

A Kraken will appear in this stage.\nIt will appear when you have earned <color=#FF423F>800</color> points.\nWhen defeated, it awards a large amount of points and destroys all other targets onscreen.
A Pirate Captain will appear in this stage.\nWhen defeated, he will drop a treasure chest. Shoot the treasure quickly to earn a large amount of points.
After the end of your shift, your friends may also stop by the shaved ice stand.\nTheir orders will count toward your total sales, so be sure to serve them the shaved ice they want.
An octopus will appear on this stage.\nWhen destroyed, it emits a plume of black smoke that obscures your view.
But <color=#FF423F>you've only got one shot</color>! You need to time your self-destructs carefully, or you'll run out of bots!
Each stage has multiple waves, and the current wave number is displayed at the top.\nWhen time runs out, all regular tagets will automatically disappear, and a new wave of targets will appear.
Each work shift has a set limit on time and the number of customers you can serve.\nYour shift will end when <color=#FF423F>time is up</color> or <color=#FF423F>all customers have been served</color>, so try to serve as many customers as possible in the shortest amount of time.
Explosive barrels will appear on this stage.\nWhen destroyed, they will deal heavy damage to surrounding targets.
Hitting targets will build up combo points, and when your combo gets higher, you will earn more points for defeating targets.\nYou can get up to <color=#FF423F>3x</color> points with a combo of <color=#FF423F>400</color> or more.\nYour combo will be broken if you do not hit a target.
How will the challenger overcome this? Stay tuned and find out!
However, the challengers also have a new tool in their arsenal!\nIt's the <color=#FF423F>Self-Destruct Bot</color>!
If a square is occupied by a Firewall or another robot, <color=#FF423F>the protagonist and other robots cannot enter</color>. Plan your route carefully.
If you push a <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>, <color=#FF423F>King Bot</color>, or <color=#FF423F>Self-Destruct Bot</color> onto a Berserk Bot's square, you can attack and destroy it.\nDefeat them to clear additional challenges.
In Endless Mode, there is no limit to the number of waves, and the targets are changed for each wave. The game will not end until you fail to meet a stage's requirements.
In Endless Mode, you have unlimited time and customers.\nHowever, if you serve too many incorrect orders, your shift will end.
In Endless Mode, your friends will not come to the shaved ice shop.
It may be small, but it packs a punch! It can <color=#FF423F>self-destruct to destroy Electrolock Barriers</color>!
It's an <color=#FF423F>obstacle</color> blocking the challenger's path!
Keep an eye out for <color=#FF423F>Bad Sectors</color>.\nOnly <color=#FF423F>Combat Drones</color> can cross these areas.
Monitor the situation carefully as you move the <color=#FF423F>King Bot</color>.\nOnce the <color=#FF423F>King Bot</color> reaches the <color=#FF423F>Objective</color>, the challenge is complete.
PC: Use the <color=#FF423F>mouse</color> to aim, <color=#FF423F>left click</color> to fire a single shot, and <color=#FF423F>hold down left click</color> to fire continuously.\nGamepad: Use the <color=#FF423F>Left Stick</color> to aim, <color=#FF423F>R2/RT</color> to fire a single shot, and hold down to fire continously.
Quickly and accurately serving shaved ice orders will improve the shop's <color=#FF423F>Reputation</color>.\n<color=#FF423F>1</color> Reputation point will convert to <color=#FF423F>20</color> Sales at the end of the shift.
Serving shaved ice and improving your Reputation will result in higher sales.\nThe goal of the shaved ice shop is to have the highest sales possible to bring in profit.
Shooting stars will appear in this stage.\nThey move fast, but if destroyed they will award a large amount of points.
The <color=#FF423F>Key Switch</color> near an <color=#FF423F>Electrolock Barrier</color> can deactivate it, allowing you to pass.\nThe Key Switch will be activated when a robot enters its square.
There are <color=#FF423F>Gold Coins</color> on the squares. Collect them to clear additional challenges.

There is a <color=#FF423F>time limit</color> for how long customers are willing to wait for shaved ice. The waiting time is reset when the correct shaved ice is served.
This is the insurmountable <color=#FF423F>Firewall</color> that <color=#FF423F>blocks the advance of all robots</color>!
Throw away shaved ice you've created by dragging it to the trash can.
What's this? A new obstacle has appeared!\nIt's the <color=#FF423F>Electrolock Barrier</color>! Shocking!
When the protagonist is next to a robot, he can push it.\nA push instantly moves the robot one square in the direction of the push and consumes one <color=#FF423F>Movement Point</color>.
When the protagonist is next to a robot, he can push it.\nEach time a robot is pushed, it will move forward one square in the direction of the push.\nEach square moved will consume one <color=#FF423F>Movement Point</color>.
When the terrain changes, the <color=#FF423F>Berserk Bots</color> will change their route.\nUse this to your advantage to defeat the enemies.
When you hit a target, the number of hits required to destroy it will be displayed underneath.\nWhen the gauge reaches 0, the target will be destroyed.\nOne water shot usually deals <color=#FF423F>1</color> point of damage, but there are various ways to increase the damage.
When your water runs out, you will be unable to fire.\n<color=#FF423F>Release the fire button</color> to automatically refill water over time.
While business is open, customers will place orders, and you must quickly combine ingredients to <color=#FF423F>fulfill the order</color> and serve the shaved ice they request.
Will our challenger be able to make use of this new item?
