Hm? Could there be a secret\npath in this room?
Hm? I think there's something here.
Hm? Is that the unmistakable aura of a rare item?
Hmm!? Intruder!
Hmm, well, I guess we did okay, but let's try\nharder next time.
Hmm... Did you hear what those shadows said?
Hmm... Doesn't seem to be many enemies around.
Hmm... Intriguing.
Hmm... Seems like we can't get in this way.
Hmm... Seems like we need <color=#FF423F>%s</color>\nin order to unlock this.
Hmm... We could try changing spots.
Hmm... we can use this space.
Hmm? Something caught my eye...
Hmm? There's something different about this one!
Hmm? Who are you?
Hmmm, gettin' some "secret passage" vibes here!
Hmmm, it won't open.
Hmmm, it won't open...
Hmmm, it's showing an error. This <color=#FF423F>robot</color> can't enter authentication areas.
Hmmm, no response. Looks like there's <color=#FF423F>not enough energy</color>.
Hmmm, that's unfortunate... However, I do understand.
Hmmm, there's no reaction. Let's call the <color=#FF423F>robot</color> over to help.
Hmmm... This room's suspicious.\nA hidden path, maybe?
Hmmm... looks like it's locked.
Hmmm... maybe you should\nswitch to a better rod?
Hmmm... maybe you should\nswitch to better bait?
Hmph! Cowards.
Hmph, it seems it doesn't open.\nSo be it.
Hoho, I didn't expect to get my hands on something like this.

Hoohoo! Your first home run!\nYou can collect your first Home Run Award.
Hoom, we've seen this one before. I suppose\nthat's how the cookie crumbles...
Hope it's something good!
Hope this can cure my boredom.

Huh!? There was...\nsomeone there just\nnow, wasn't there?
Huh, I didn't expect this to come out.
Huh, it's not opening?
Huh, you're better than I thought.
Huh... Not bad.
Huh? Are you returning already?
Huh? Do you feel a draft?
Huh? Is it locked?
Huh? It appears this door is locked.
Huh? It won't open.
Huh? That one looks tough! Look out!
Huh? They're gone...\nHow could that be!?
Huh? This door's locked\nfrom the other side...
Huh? We're going back right now!?
Huh? We're only halfway but... Is it okay?
Huh? What was that?
Huh? You called?
Huh? You want to retreat?
Hurry up and follow them.
I am at your command!
I am indeed ready.
I am now able to go\nto Shibuya! I should go\nwhen I get some time.
I am the guardian\nof this castle...
I believe in you.
I blew it...
I can fight too.
I can see it now... Victory is in sight!
I can take the lead. Let's go!
I can't believe you're this weak...\nIf you want to win against me, you need to avoid getting <color=#FF423F>knocked down</color>...
I can't feel a thing! Unless you deal <color=#FF423F>continuous damage</color> in 1 turn, you'll never win against me!
I can't move with this wind... Sorry, but I'm leaving this to you!
I can't stand loud noises!
I cannot betray\nKiuchi-sama's trust...
I could collect some more.
I could use a rest.
I detect a hidden passage. Try to find it.
I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.
I did my best! What did you think, big bro?
I did the best I could, I suppose.
I did the thing!
I didn't know there was\na safe room here...
I don't know where they are.
I don't really like it. Give it to someone else.

I don't wanna do\nanything that's gonna\nget us killed...
I don't want to up and give up right in the middle, but... I guess there's no other way.
I doubt there's anyone\nslacking off...
I feel a breeze... Is there a hidden path there?
I feel like there's a hidden passage here.
I feel we are being guided by the unseen...
I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here somewhere.\n...Or not.
I got careless...
I got careless... Focus on healing!
I got this!
I got you.
I had fun today! Thanks.
I have a bad feeling about this...\nIt's a trap! Everyone, be careful.
I have joined the <color=#ffc000>band club</color>.\nI can participate in club activities from the Kokatsu Academy club bulletin board.

I haven't even gotten\nstarted yet.
I haven't had enough yet! I still want to keep defeating foes. Will you join me?
I hear wind... There might be a hidden passage nearby.
I heard something...
I heard your call!
I hope it's something good.
I hope this can provide some fleeting amusement.
I just checked\nover there.
I just want to punch\nsomething... A thief or a brat,\nanything will do...
I knew it had to be this way
I know how to solve this.
I let my guard down... The rest is up to you!
I look forward to working with you all!
I lost them...
I may need to pace myself...
I messed up!
I might not make it...
I must fulfill my duty!
I mustn't let\nmy guard down\nfor even a moment...
I need to let loose!
I need to maintain\nthis figure...
I need to report this\nto Kiuchi-sama.
I need to work\nharder next time...
I pledge my loyalty\nto Miyazawa-sama...
I really hope it's something good!
I request an explanation...
I said get back here!
I saw that one coming from miles away.
I saw your face!
I sealed the deal, huh?
I see, an interesting lineup...
I see... A tactical retreat...
I see... I'll return immediately.
I sense a formidable enemy approaching.\nIs it time to use... that power?
I sense a most excellent harvest!
I sense someone\nclose by...
I sense treasure! Should we look around?
I sense treasure...
I should report to Merope\nthat we changed the corrupt\nproducer's heart...
I should spend time\nwith Kira today...
I should spend time\nwith Miyu today...
I smell treasure!
I suggest we take a break.
I suppose we should get serious, then.
I think I can do it.
I think I just saw a treasure chest around here...
I think I'd better take it easy this week.\nLet's give it a shot next week.
I think I'm a bit tired...
I think it'd go well, but... Okay, I'll go back and rest.
I think that's enough\nfor today. All in moderation,\nright?
I think there's a passage nearby...
I thought I told you <color=#FF423F>not to attack me</color>...\nWhy won't you listen to me...?
I trust you.
I wanna be like\nKiuchi-sama...
I wanna be\nKiuchi-sama's favorite...
I wanna be\na starter...
I wanna keep going till the end next time!
I wanna know what's inside.
I wanna see Kiuchi-sama\nplay with my\nown eyes...
I want to come back and play again!
I want to take a\nbreak soon...
I wanted to keep going until the end...
I wanted to see it through till the end...
I was careless.
I was getting restless.
I will protect everyone...!
I will protect this...\nIt's my job...
I wish I could play\nwith Kiuchi-sama...
I won't betray your expectations!
I won't give up!
I won't hold back!
I won't let you down.
I won't let you escape!
I won't let you escape,\nyou thieves!
I won't let you go!
I won't let you go!\nEveryone, intruders!\nSurround them!
I won't let you petty\nthieves escape!
I won't let you\nslip away...!
I wonder if I'll see\nKiuchi-sama today.
I wonder if there's\nanything fun to do...
I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.
I wonder what'll happen today. I can't wait!
I wonder what's inside!
I wonder what's inside.
I wonder what's inside. Let's see!
I'd like to heal up, if we have a chance...
I'll admit you're good... but you're not on my level.
I'll be the ground to your feet!
I'll catch anything you\nthrow at me.\nBring it on!
I'll chase you\nwherever you go!
I'll curse you...
I'll do my best to keep up.
I'll do my best to support you!
I'll do my best!
I'll do my best, you just watch!

I'll give it my best shot.
I'll go above and beyond!
I'll go!
I'll handle it!
I'll help you out.
I'll hurt them... and no\none is allowed to complain.
I'll keep doing my best.
I'll kill you! I swear\nI'll kill you!
I'll live up to your expectations!
I'll make it the best show ever.
I'll never let you down!
I'll serve up a full course!
I'll show you what I can do!
I'll treat it like a research trip.
I'm a bit tired,\nbut it was an interesting\nexperience.
I'm a bit tired. Let's take a short break to regain some energy.
I'm a bit tired...\nCan we rest over here?
I'm a huge fan of\nKiuchi-sama!
I'm afraid you haven't set a new record...\nLet's rethink our strategy.
I'm aiming for the Home Run Award next time.
I'm all set!
I'm all warmed up!
I'm back... Now feel my wrath!
I'm detecting a trap...
I'm devoted to\nKiuchi-sama!
I'm down for the count!
I'm exhausted!\nI request a short break, please!
I'm feeling a breeze.\nThere could be a crack somewhere.
I'm feeling energized!\nHaha!
I'm getting a bit thirsty.\nLet's go grab a drink!
I'm getting a bit tired. Let's take a break.
I'm getting excited! Let's go!

I'm here! It'll all be okay!
I'm just about through\nwith this job...
I'm kickin' you\noutta here!
I'm kicking you\noutta here!
I'm kind of nervous all of a sudden... No, you've got this, Miyu!
I'm not feeling so great...
I'm not giving in...!
I'm not going to let you down.
I'm not scared, 'cause I am strong! Does not\nmatter who comes along!
I'm not some paper tiger, okay?
I'm okay. I'll return soon.
I'm reaching my limit...
I'm ready to fight!
I'm really tired!
I'm so bored...
I'm so bored...\nI wonder if anyone\nwill come...
I'm so pumped!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry... I wasn't strong enough...
I'm sorry... If only I could've done a little better...
I'm sweating...
I'm taking you down!
I'm the strongest\ncatcher in the game!
I'm throwing you outta\nhere right now!
I'm up... Please don't get nervous...
I'm with you.
I've already received a lot, so no thanks.
I've been waiting for this!
I've detected a strong enemy.\nStay vigilant.
I've got a bad feeling...
I've got this!
I've got this.
I've got you covered.
I've got your back!
I've gotta work hard,\nand make it onto\nthe starting lineup...
I've just realized\u2014that's quite valuable!
I've lost them... Where did\nyou hide? Show yourselves!
I've returned. What's the next mission?
I-I hope there are\nno intruders...\nPlease, no...
I-I'll do my best!
I-I'll punch you to death!\nI'll kill you with my sword!
I-I'm a bit tired...
I-I'm sorry!
I-I'm sorry... I wish\nI could've helped more...
I... I... I...
I... can't move...
If I can be an asset to the team, I'll rest easy.
If ever you need my power,\ncall upon me again.
If it keeps on like this, it'll be a cakewalk.
If it's an info war, I'm your girl.
If only I had finished up a little faster...
If only I were\nstronger...

Wait!
Wait, is this the\nright patrol route?\n...Eh, it's fine.
Wait, what\nwas that...?
Want to hang out with them?
Want to help out today?
Want to help out today?\nYou're a lifesaver!
Want to take a quick break?
Wasn't that the best show ever? Hehe.
Watch carefully!\nBlink and you'll miss it!
Watch out! Be careful!
Watch out! Strong enemies, and\nthey've got you surrounded!
Way to go, Wonder!\nI'm pumped up!
We all deserve a nice long vacation.
We can rest here safely.
We can rest over there!
We can't get through here? Let's try somewhere else.
We defeated all the enemies!
We did a pretty good\njob today, huh?
We did it!
We did it.
We did it. Let's keep up this momentum.
We didn't raise our score this time... that's\nokay, next time we'll take our revenge!
We found a new area.\nLet's go check it out.
We found a safe room!\nShould we take a quick break for drinks?
We found the treasure!
We got them all!
We got too careless. I'll see what I can do...
We gotta take this more seriously...!
We have quite a selection. You're free to pick what you like.

We made an absolute killing!
We made it back safely.\nLet's do our best next time too!
We made it back! Should we take a break?
We must protect\nthis place...
We must strengthen\nour defenses...
We must support\nKiuchi-sama!
We need to change our strategy.
We need to hold\nour position.
We need to hurry\nand find them...
We need to protect\nthis place...
We really outdid ourselves.
We should rest.\nBe careful not to put too much strain on your body.
We should rethink our strategy.
We talked a lot today. Let's check out other places too, woof.
We win!
We won't be found by the enemy here.\nLet's get organized.
We're absolutely rolling in tickets!\nWe should be able to go somewhere new.
We're all set!
We're at a disadvantage. Let's regroup!
We're at our destination.
We're bound to get a high score for sure.
We're here!
We're here! This is our destination, right?
We're here! We're here!
We're here. Now what do we do?
We're here. What do we do now?
We're here. What's next, Wonder?
We're here.\nSo... what's next?
We're here.\nWhat do we do next?
We're still in danger. We should heal.
We're surrounded. Be careful!
We've accumulated quite a few tickets.\nShould we go redeem them soon?
We've arrived. Let's go.
We've arrived. Now then...
We've arrived. What do we do from here?
We've arrived. Wonder. What should we do next?
We've arrived?
We've been exploring for a while...\nShould we take a break soon?
We've been putting in a considerable amount of effort...\nShall we rest for a moment?
We've found a secret area!
We've fully explored this area.\nGreat job.
We've gotta work together,\neveryone!
We've made it. This is the place, right?
We've reached a good stopping\npoint. Should we regroup and\nreview our intel?
We... lost...?
Weapon already selected.

What are the contents?
What are you\ndoing here?
What could be inside...?
What do we do?\nUh, we've gotta regroup!

What do you think, will you spend time with Ayaka?
What do you think? Good, right?
What is it? Something good?
What is that...?
What is that?
What kind of show will you\nput on this time, I wonder?\nI can't wait!
