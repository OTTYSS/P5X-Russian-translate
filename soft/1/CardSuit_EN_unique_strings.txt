Struggling forward along the path, carrying a great weight alone. Even when defeat seems inevitable, there is still hope ahead.
Take your desires in hand and form them into a spear, piercing through the dark clouds that obscure the truth.
The black current gradually recedes, and light appears on the horizon. Fears and doubts will be lifted with the coming dawn.
The fierce flames roar and rage, engulfing everything until silence returns and a gentle light shines through.
The fog is now lifted, and the scenery before our eyes becomes bathed in light. The true world is finally here.
The foggy path is choked with vines, and demons whisper to lead travelers astray. When will this curse be lifted?
