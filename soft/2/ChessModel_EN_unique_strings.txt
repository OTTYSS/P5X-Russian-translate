<color=#FF423F>Gold Coins</color> can be found on the ground and collected. Pick up as many as you can!
<color=#FF423F>Key Switches</color> are activated when a robot stands on them, and will disable an Electrolock Barrier.
<color=#FF423F>Self-Destruct Bots</color> can blow themselves up to destroy Electrolock Barriers or enemy robots.
The <color=#FF423F>King Bot</color> is at the heart of the robot party, and taking it to the goal will clear the challenge. Of course, you must protect it.
