Capy B. is the most popular animal in the zoo. Just seeing him and his family enjoying a relaxing time is comforting. He loves taking baths.
In Japanese, the words for owl and no hardship sound similar, which is why owls bring to mind positive concepts. These fluffy winter owls are cute and popular.
Shichi-kun works hard every day to promote his beloved Shibuya to everyone. If you want to enjoy Shibuya to the fullest, go on a walk with Shichi-kun.
With their unique characteristics and personalities, these tanks fight to the absolute limit of their abilities in an ever-changing war zone. Who will dominate the battlefield?
You feel like someone calls you name, but when you turn around, no one is there. Perhaps it's a resident of another world, calling out to you.
