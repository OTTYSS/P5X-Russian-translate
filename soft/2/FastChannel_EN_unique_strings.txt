After overhearing your conversation with Motoha on the school rooftop, Lufel could see the potential for strong desire within her.|As evidence, the Metaverse Navigator app icon appeared on her smartphone.|However, Lufel didn't think she was truly committed to the job, and thought it would be best not to get her involved.
Akashi gave his self-introduction at the morning assembly, and explained what his role would be. The students seemed to have a positive response.|Later, Mr. Yamanashi asked Riko to help out Akashi, which they both agreed to.|The next day, Ms. Katayama attempted to stop a student acting dangerously in the hall, which caused a stir.
As you started to head home, a group of girls chatting in the hallway blocked your path.|However, when you tried to call out to them, you felt strange and couldn't muster up the energy to do anything.|Just then, the head of the Disciplinary Committee happened to pass by and helped you out.
As you were infiltrating Katayama's Palace, you found your path blocked by a strangely dressed man.|Back in reality, you theorized that the man was probably a cognitive form of Akashi created by Katayama.|That night, following Shun's suggestion, the Phantom Thieves met up at Heritage Kitchen.
Defeated, Miyazawa's Shadow confessed his dreams of becoming an actor and his long-held desire to be the "real thing".|As he was on the verge of giving up, Shun lectured him, telling him to atone for his sins and then come back to the shop one more time.|But as you headed back to reality with your friends, you experienced a sudden vision of all of them disappearing...
During a volleyball match in gym class, Motoha was doing well and was congratulated by the other students.|Shun talked to you while you were stretching and asked you about her.|Later, you and Lufel paid a visit to a clinic in Yongen-Jaya.
Ever since Kiuchi's arrest, the talk about the calling card and the Phantom Thieves has increased.|Motoha was glad to hear that you wanted to continue your Phantom Thief activities, and hopes to continue working together.|At the same time, Miyazawa was scheming to take control over Victory Kitchen's business.
Fresh from your successful operation at Miyazawa's Palace, Lufel speculated that there may be a hidden mastermind behind Miyazawa's distorted desires.|Miyazawa's Shadow mentioned someone just before fading away. Could they be the true culprit?|Upon your return to reality, you found that Miyazawa's Treasure had changed form and become an old movie ticket.
Heritage Kitchen was closed, and inside, Miyazawa forced the owner, Yamagoshi, to hand over the ownership documents.|Against Yamagoshi's will, Miyazawa stamped the papers. Just then, Shun appeared and clashed with Miyazawa again.|Miyazawa suggested settling the matter in a "Food Fight", and Shun accepted the challenge.
In a high-class casino you've never seen before, a figure who appeared to be a thief was cornered by men in black suits.|The men suddenly transformed into monsters, but the thief was unshaken, and easily dispatched them.|However, before he could make his exit, a masked figure appeared and attacked him...
In order to infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace, you will need to craft some infiltration tools.|You headed to Yongen-Jaya with Lufel to secure a workbench to use.|Meanwhile, Motoha was overjoyed to hear that her best friend Tomoko was scouted for the baseball team.
In the Velvet Room, Igor offered his congratulations for your victory over the sinner of lust.|Continuing on, he suggested that even more people may be affected by your desires and the choices you make.|Later, you talked with Shun on the rooftop and learned his past, as well as his true reason for accepting Miyazawa's challenge.
In the aftermath of the Food Fight, Miyazawa wasn't doing very well, and seemed to be feeling the pressure from his mysterious contact.|Hiding his internal dissatisfaction, he headed to Victory Kitchen to record another video.|But when he arrived, he count the store plastered with calling cards from the Phantom Thieves.
In the middle of your dinner at Victory Kitchen, you got kicked out by a man named Miyazawa.|While discussing the flavor of the ramen outside the restaurant, you were approached by Shun Kano, a student who goes to your school.|Later, you saw a news report on Kiuchi's arrest, and decided to continue your work as a Phantom Thief.
In the video Motoha showed you, you find out that Shun did end up going to Victory Kitchen to settle his score with Miyazawa.|Feeling like Shun's chances of winning were slim, you called Yamagoshi at the hospital and asked for help.|He was able to give you a valuable hint, and you hurried off with your companions to help Shun.
Kiuchi had set his sights on Motoha as his next target, and attempted to attack her on her way to school.|However, sensing the danger just in time, Tomoko shielded Motoha and ended up grievously injured instead.|Motoha pleaded with the police to do something about Kiuchi, but with their desires stolen from them, they had no motivation to help.
Kiuchi's heart was successfully changed, and you went out for ramen with your teammates to celebrate.|On the train to Shinjuku, Motoha asked Lufel about regaining his lost memories.\nAccording to Lufel, each Treasure may return part of his memories, and there are seven of them in total.
Lufel flew above Shibuya and scattered a huge flurry of Kiuchi's calling cards over the plaza.|When Kiuchi saw the calling card, he stormed away from the station in a rage.|The time for a decisive battle has arrived. You and your fellow Phantom Thieves made the final preparations and headed for Kiuchi's Palace.
Miyazawa proposed the Food Fight under the orders of some mysterious person.|In exchange, this unknown benefactor said they would help make Miyazawa's dreams come true.|Meanwhile, you found the location of Miyazawa's Palace within Mementos, and attempted to begin your infiltration.
Miyazawa tried to strongarm Masa into helping with the rigged Food Fight, but Masa refused.|Ultimately, Masa was forced to leave the judging panel, and Shun's Food Fight against Miyazawa began.|At that time, you found yourself stuck on a stopped train, and you had no choice but to use a risky move...
Ms. Katayama objected to the introduction of the new educational consultant, Kei Akashi.|However, the academic coordinator Mr. Yamanashi supported Akashi and criticized the way Ms. Katayama handles her students.|After that, Ms. Katayama seemed to be irritible during class, and some of the students looked unhappy.
Ms. Katayama was suspended from school due to accusations of violent behavior.|You met with your teammates on the rooftop, and after considering what happened at Katayama's Palace, decided to investigate Akashi.|However, just as you were about to begin the operation, an unexpected person offered to help.
On a rainy day, you and Motoha forgot to bring umbrellas, so Riko Tanemura offered both of you a ride in her car to school.|Riko seemed to be constantly busy during the ride, but you also got the feeling that she has a good relationship with Motoha.|You said your goodbyes to Riko when you arrived at school, and then Motoha remembered there was a school-wide assembly in the gym.
On the way to school, you happened to meet Tomoko. She was discharged from the hospital and seemed to be doing much better.|According to Lufel, it seems highly likely that the next Palace ruler will be connected to Heritage Kitchen somehow.|To look for clues, you made your way to Heritage Kitchen after school.
Once again, Igor congratulated you for defeating the sinner of vanity.|However, he also suggested there may be others besides the Phantom Thieves capable of using the Metaverse Navigator.|The next day, you encountered Yamagoshi on your way to school. Now that Miyazawa's heart has been changed, Yamagoshi seems to be in better health.
Once again, you were summoned to the Velvet Room, where you were told about the importance of shared bonds of desire.|According to Merope, it seems several people have already been effected by the ripples of your desire.|Igor warned you that you must nurture your desires to avoid a fate of ruin.
Riko's plan went perfectly, and you were able to get the password from Akashi's PC with no problems.|After that, you met up with Riko at a caf\xe9 in Kichijoji, and asked her about the information she got from the PC.|It seemed she was not able to check everything yet, but you still got plenty of info besides just the password.
Shun realized he didn't have the shaver box he needed to prepare the ramen. Miyazawa just laughed, and told him he threw it away.|However, you were able to deliver Yamagoshi's message to Masa. He found the shaver box in the safe, and gave it to Shun.|Thanks to your efforts, Shun was able to flawlessly recreate the legendary flavor of Victory Kitchen.
Somewhere in Mementos, a massive Shadow let out a bellowing roar...|In the real world, Akashi managed to acquire evidence that Ms. Katayama was the infamous "Hit-and-Run Rider", and silently smiled to himself.|After Ms. Katayama's suspension, the teachers have been unable to control the students.
The famous food critic Hiromu Miyazawa filmed a video at Victory Kitchen while no customers were around.|Once the video was over, his demeanor changed completely, and he demanded an unbelievable sum of money from the manager, Masa.|He threatened to spread bad press about the restaurant if he refused, leaving Masa no choice but to comply.
The genuine flavor that Shun served up was enough to move Miyazawa to tears. It seemed like Shun's victory was certain.|However, Miyazawa refused to accept defeat, and even attempted to call the police on Shun.|You fled the shop along with Shun, but at that moment, Shun activated the Metaverse Navigator.
The public was shocked by Miyazawa's sudden declaration that he would quit his career as a celebrity critic.|He also made a public confession to all the crimes he committed, breaking down into tears as he apologized.|After this second successful change of heart, the bonds between the Phantom Thieves have grown even stronger.
The route to the Treasure was secured, but in order to execute the change of heart, every member of the Phantom Thieves must be in agreement.|After seeing how Tomoko's desires and will to live had been stolen from her, Motoha felt renewed motivation to change Kiuchi's heart.|You and Lufel agreed, and decided to deliver the calling card to Kiuchi.
The strange creature calling itself "Lufel" was your guide as you entered a mysterious other world called Mementos.|As you tried to find a way out, terrifying monsters surrounded you, and all hope seemed lost.|However, before your strength failed completely, you awakened to a power that was slumbering within you: your Persona.
The video of Ms. Katayama stopping the student in the hallway was posted to Divine Justice, and she was publicly branded as an abusive teacher.|Without giving her a chance to defend herself, Mr. Yamanashi condemned her and ordered her to be suspended.|With no other teachers coming to her side, Ms. Katayama had no choice but to accept the punishment.
While eating at Heritage Kitchen, you heard about Ms. Katayama's school days from Yamagoshi and Masa.|Ms. Katayama seemed worried about how busy Riko always is, but when Akashi showed up, she suddenly became enraged.|Unable to hold back her anger, Ms. Katayama started to get violent, but the scene was caught on film by a student.
You headed to a new area of Mementos, where you were attacked by an enemy you defeated once before.|With the help of your allies, you were able to defeat them, but unfortunately you couldn't locate the next Palace.|Meanwhile, the Menace known only as the "Hit-and-Run Rider" is causing chaos in the city at night.
You suddenly felt tired in the classroom and fell asleep. You awakened to find yourself in a mysterious space that seemed to be an undersea tunnel.|You met a strange, long-nosed old man who called himself Igor, along with his assistant, Merope...|Before you knew it, you awakened back in the classroom... but was it really just a dream?
You were unable to find the next Palace in Mementos, and returned to the real world, where you happened to meet Shun.|After hearing that Motoha missed the old flavors of Victory Kitchen she remembered from long ago, Shun invites you both to visit Heritage Kitchen that night.|While eating at Victory Kitchen, Masa told you about the feud between Miyazawa and Shun.
You witnessed a shocking scene from the train platform, but something wasn't right about the reactions from those around you.|Still feeling strange, you boarded the train, when suddenly a talking owl called out to you.|You struggled to process all of the unusual events of the past day, but this was really just the beginning...
Your classmate Motoha Arai told you the latest rumors about Divine Justice, a website that collects information on Menaces.|Afterwards, Lufel told you about the evil deeds committed by a Menace named Takeyuki Kiuchi.
