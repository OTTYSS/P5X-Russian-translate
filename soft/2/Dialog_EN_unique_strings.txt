Agh! I gotta get my act together! I have to\nfind a purpose fast!
Agh! I just wanna get back to kicking ASAP!

Ah well, nothing for it. I'll just have to\ntake out these fools myself.
Ah yes, outside of the train station. You\nwere with Yaoling-san then as well.
Ah yes, the story continues.
Ah yes, you have an eye for value, doncha!
Ah!
Ah! A-Apologies. I lost my composure for a\nsecond there.
Ah! Another shield!? But we just broke the\nfirst one!
Ah! Are they talking about the calling cards!?
Ah! Come on!
Ah! Gotta hurry!
Ah! Hey, Minami!
Ah! Hooo! Raaagh!
Ah! I need to get a bath ready for my hubby!
Ah! I'm late! I have to go!

Ah! I've gotta hurry! I'm supposed to help\nset up the classroom before first period...
Ah! Indeed, she's nowhere to be found.\nHow could it have taken me so long to\nnotice?
Ah! It won't open!
Ah! It'll burn if we keep chatting like this,\nSensei. Let's dig in!

Ah! {NAME2}! Sorry 'bout this!
Ah!? Don't scare me like that!
Ah, Fumi-chan. You headin' out?
Ah, Hiroto! Don't go off too far! It's not safe!
Ah, I am so glad you two showed up. Our usual\npart-timers canceled at the last minute.
Ah, I beg your pardon, miss. I'm afraid we\ndon't have any at this establishment.
Ah, I can see how it is a breach of\netiquette to hold a long conversation\nwithout compensation.
Ah, I can't believe I've been here so long already.\nI always lose track of time when I'm here...
Ah, I can't wait for that Food Fight video!
Ah, I feel much more confident about all this\nafter talking with you, {NAME1}-san!
Ah, I get it. That's too bad. Maybe some\nother time. I'd really like to come over!
Ah, I recognize this one too. But I was\nsure we defeated it back then.
Ah, I see the orange tabby is with you.
Ah, I see you're a careful reader.\nThat's right! It was his wealth.
Ah, I see. In that case, I will wait here\nuntil you are ready.
Ah, I see. Maybe I'll take it on another\ntime then.
Ah, I see. Sorry if my daughter's causing you trouble!
Ah, I should go grab something to drink!
Ah, I suppose I did catch you off guard.\nMake sure to be ready with a question\nnext time!
Ah, I'm sorry!
Ah, I'm sorry! You came out to hear me play,\nand here I am moping around...

Ah, Yui's told me about you.
Ah, a more toothsome level to try...
Ah, a new order. Hurry, but don't rush!
Ah, a treasure chest key.
Ah, an action game today?
Ah, and here's your pay. You're a lifesaver!
Ah, apologies. I should start from the\nbeginning.
Ah, are you curious about this book?
Ah, as for the state of my own room... I am \nnot taking any questions at this time,\ngot it?
Ah, but I only have one sausage. How about\nmy rolled omelet? It's my specialty!
Ah, but I only have one sausage. Well,\nI guess I can split it in half.
Ah, but if it's words of love you want to\nhear, I'm happy to oblige.
Ah, but in your world, there's no Big Bang\nBurger, right?
Ah, but you're probably right about\nthe meddling part at least.
Ah, but you're probably tired of drinking\nthe same stuff you have at home...
Ah, but, {NAME1}-san, you must\nknow their meaning.
Ah, but... I couldn't be any happier...\nMrrreow...
Ah, but... It's also nice to eat yakitori\nwhile having a drink in the park...
Ah, crap! It's that time already!?
Ah, did you say that because "hikaru" means\n"to shine"?
Ah, dinner time already...\nCan I help you?
Ah, do not be alarmed. I simply hope to speak\nwith you as usual.
Ah, excuse me. We were going to leave things\nhere for today, weren't we?
Ah, fifth period's starting. See you guys\nafter school!
Ah, forgive me. Perhaps, I was a bit\novereager.
Ah, good timing. I was just thinkin' we could do\nwith some music.
Ah, got it. Let me know when you're done,\nthen!
Ah, he's right. First, let's show you one\nof them.
Ah, hehehe... Thank you!
Ah, here's a leftover part. Hold onto that.
Ah, hey there, sport.
Ah, hey! What the hell!? Give that back!
Ah, how fascinating. What is your specialty?
Ah, is that right...?
Ah, it flew away.
Ah, it is nothing... Such lovely weather we\nare having...
Ah, it's already this late!?
Ah, it's the orange tabby! Are you hungry?
Ah, it's time.
Ah, it's you!
Ah, it's you. Perfect timing.
Ah, just like it said in the title. Quite a\nperfect happy ending, wasn't it? Not a single\nloose end.
Ah, just look at that. It appears there are\ntwo mechanisms over there.
Ah, looks like you were able to get a seat.\nWould you like to read something on\nthe way there?
Ah, me too! I wanna see too!
Ah, much appreciated!
Ah, much appreciated. It shouldn't take\ntoo long.
Ah, nice to meet you. Are you one of this\norange tabby's friends too?
Ah, no adult stores though, got it? Let's\nkeep our survey within the bounds of the law.
Ah, no... It's nothing important, but...
Ah, not right now though! I need some time to think about what I want to say.
Ah, nothing else we can do! In that case...
Ah, okay! Another time then!
Ah, okay. No worries, then. Sorry for asking\nso suddenly.
Ah, okay...
Ah, oops!
Ah, perfect for the glutes and quads.\nNo pain, no gain I guess.
Ah, perhaps I ought to open up the floor?\nLet's see here...
Ah, she's, uh... what'd you call it...? Talented. She seems like a talented kid.
Ah, shit... What the hell is my life!?
Ah, shut your mouth! Anyway... This place is still dangerous for a kid your age.
Ah, so different countries use their own\ncategorization methods, hm? For example,\npsychology books would be... Hoohoo.
Ah, so good to see ya, sweet pea!
Ah, so he solicited the public's sympathy for an injury that turned out to be fake...
Ah, so that makes it the perfect spot for our celebratory dinner.
Ah, so you heard about it from Tsurumi.\nTaiko already refused the band's offer\nthough.
Ah, so you were home after all.
Ah, sorry 'bout that! It's always like this\naround here...
Ah, sorry for butting in.
Ah, sorry for rambling on about myself.
Ah, sorry for taking up so much of your time.
Ah, sorry for yelling out of nowhere. But\nhey, look.
Ah, sorry to accost you out of nowhere.\nDon't worry, I'm not some sort of weirdo.
Ah, sorry! But I just remembered...
Ah, sorry! Forgot about the code names, hahaha...
Ah, sorry! I can tell you're still pretty\nconfused...
Ah, sorry! I just got a little excited.
Ah, sorry. Ignore me. I just heard you guys talkin' and\u2014
Ah, sorry. Let's actually go home. I didn't mean to rekindle the conversation.
Ah, sorry... I might not seem that worried,\nbut it really is a problem.
Ah, speaking of cats... I hear there's a fat\norange cat around Zoshigaya.
Ah, sweet, sweet Tomoko. I can read you\nlike a book. To think you have eyes for more\nthan just baseball!
Ah, thank goodness. Looks like the trains\nare running normally again!
Ah, thank you! This will certainly help my\npoor flowers.
Ah, thank you! You've been a great help.
Ah, that customer is ready to pay.
Ah, that girl...
Ah, that looks like it might fit with\nthe key fragment we found!
Ah, that makes it sound like some sort of\nshoddy hand-me-down, doesn't it? Sorry...
Ah, that part's not meant to overlap... Try to pass it through the bottom there and... Yes, that's it.
Ah, that's a relief... I'd be in huge trouble\nif my mom saw this.
Ah, that's correct! I see you get what makes\nregular hexagons special.
Ah, that's right! I should check with that\nguy about the photo I took.
Ah, that's right! It took over 2,000 years.
Ah, that's right. As you can see, the main\nfan's chain is broken.
Ah, that's right. I was hoping you could\nread the manual and learn the locations of\nall the shelves.
Ah, that's right. Where are my manners?\nYou may call me... <color=#FF423F>Igor</color>.
Ah, that's right. You did work out the\npuzzles faster in the beginning.
Ah, that's right. You do live in a rather lavish home.
Ah, that's right... "Change."
Ah, that's why she's Lightning Legs...
Ah, the bouquet brouhaha. I'm so grateful for\nyour help with that.
Ah, then maybe, would it be possible for my\nnext cup of tea to be a bit hotter?
Ah, there he is!
Ah, there is actually one last thing...\nThe shelves!
Ah, there may be another clue over there!
Ah, there you are. Miyashita-san!
Ah, there's another map!
Ah, there's the punching game. I could use my\nscore to measure progress.
Ah, there's the secondhand shop. Let's find ourselves a workbench.
Ah, this is from when I went to a competition\nwith my club. Here I am.
Ah, this must be what they call "tsundere."
Ah, this takes me back! Middle school was\nfun, huh?
Ah, this treasure chest is locked!
Ah, time flies. Let us leave for now and try\nagain some other time.
Ah, too bad! That's incorrect.
Ah, uh, nope! We're uhhh, all good!\nRight as rain!
Ah, um, I guess we are!
Ah, um... Sorry. I just can't stop talking,\nhuh?
Ah, very sharp. You must be an experienced\ngambler to make that connection.
Ah, visual narrative experiences!\nA fine source of sensory stimulation.
Ah, we've already got a bouquet order.
Ah, well that's part of it, but she was\nreally known for pedaling her bike crazy\nfast.
Ah, well...
Ah, well... I do have the time, but... Are\nyou, um, sure you don't mind?
Ah, what a coincidence!
Ah, what a pity... Still, you did as best\nyou could.
Ah, what am I doin' makin' you sit here and listen to our family problems.
Ah, what am I supposed to do?
Ah, what do we have here?\nA new training method!
Ah, what to do...
Ah, yes! For sure! We'd be happy to join you!
Ah, yes, I can hear it now: un, deux, trois,\nun, deux, trois! Hoohoo.
Ah, yes, that's right.
Ah, yes, you can count on us! Ahahaha...
Ah, yes.
Ah, yes. There are many terms and phrases\nmistakenly used in that way as well.
Ah, you came just at the right time!
Ah, you get it! It's so much nicer,\nisn't it?
Ah, you noticed? That's right, I added a\nlittle step to the sequence there.
Ah, you seem to be doing well today.
Ah, you're a sharp one. That's right,\nhis tombstone.
Ah, you're here.
Ah, you're right! Me too!
Ah, you're right. It's bleeding a little.
Ah, you're still aiming for a richer title?
Ah, you're up. You have school today, don't you? I'll be waiting downstairs.
Ah, {NAME1}-chan. Thank you so much for\ncoming.
Ah, {NAME1}-kun!
Ah, {NAME1}-san! Got it! You shop here\na lot?
Ah, {NAME1}-san. How are you doing?
Ah, {NAME1}-san. N-Nice day today...
Ah, {NAME2}-kun! I finished the song!
Ah, {NAME2}-san. D-Did I make you\nworry about me?
Ah, {NAME2}. Have you come for\nsome curry? What a coincidence; so have I.
Ah. A storm is brewing deep within\nmy heart today...
Ah. This about the pigtailed girl that fell on the train tracks?
Ah. We did fight an enemy similar to this one\nbefore...
Ah. Well, it's not a model I need this time,\nbut a fellow photographer.
Ah...
Ah... Aah...
Ah... All right. Um, sorry for asking out of\nthe blue.
Ah... Arghh... I... have to keep it together...
Ah... But I think all this relaxing's making\nme hungry.
Ah... But that means putting my ramen on\nhold!
Ah... But what should I do after that?\nMy boss will be so angry with me!
Ah... But you like tea, don't you? I think\n{NAME2}-kun mentioned that before.
Ah... Got it. Sorry, but could you take it\nto the back door this time?
Ah... Hm.
Ah... I did see a poster on the wall that\nsays "Recruiting for Open Mic"...
Ah... I see you don't recognize me. I'd\nprefer you introduce yourself first, but...
Ah... I think she'll be fine.
Ah... I wish I could taste all those\ndifferent cakes, too.
Ah... I'm in a hurry.
Ah... In which case, I'll be sure to steal it\nright back when the opportunity arises.
Ah... It seems my mind is still trapped\nin a state of confusion...
Ah... It's okay. Uh, sorry to bother you.
Ah... Just about the same as my grandchild. Maybe that's why I wanted to talk to you... heh.
Ah... Lord Ruby is so cool. I wish men like\nhim really existed.
Ah... Maybe that was a bit of a toughie. The\ncorrect answer is one!
Ah... Maybe that's why her Palace is a dam?
Ah... Maybe you overthought that one?
Ah... No...
Ah... Oh, but I think you'll still be able to\nappreciate this one!
Ah... Oh, yes, I almost forgot.
Ah... One word being understood in different\nways between two parties. A common issue.
Ah... Pardon me.
Ah... So that's how it's going to be.
Ah... So... hungry...
Ah... Sorry, I forgot I had work today!
Ah... Sorry. It was just the right amount of\nfluffiness, so I kinda...
Ah... That cry of anguish, welling up from\ndeep within the soul! You can feel the pain\nso vividly!
Ah... That's cool and all, but isn't it\nkinda creepy?
Ah... Those clothes are so lovely! I wish I\nhad your fashion sense!
Ah... Um, I'd like to talk about what\nhappened with Yukimi-san the other day.
Ah... What a calming space you have here!
Ah... What is it, Closer?
Ah... What strong desire. Of course, it is\nsaid that the riches can lead one to\ndistortion.
Ah... What was I doing?
Ah... Wow, it's sooo tasty! You've gotten\nsooo much better, {NAME2}-kun!
Ah... Yeah, something like that, I guess.
Ah... Yeah, that'd be nice...
Ah... You're hitting where it hurts, huh...
Ah... ain't that a massive showstopper! This\nhas got to be the most gorgeous picture frame\nI've ever laid eyes on!
Ah...!
Ah...! Here's an idea.
Ah...! Here's an idea. How about a few\nflavor substitutes to bring out the umami!
Ah...! Right. What was I thinking?
Ah\u2014 Before I forget...
Ah\u2014 I'm\u2014 Uh...
Ah\u2014 Uh\u2014 Haha...\nWell, she excels at keeping secrets too!
Aha! That room is...
Aha! What have we here? Look at all this\ndust!
Aha, correct! You must do a lot of cooking!\nIt's a task no one wants to do.
Aha, we finally get to see a smile on\nthat face!
Ahaha! Never change, Riko-senpai!
Ahaha! Sorry, I guess I'm always thinking\nabout running.
Ahaha, Hakozaki-chan spilled the tea.
Ahaha, I guess so. I really threw myself into\nevery swing.
Ahaha, I suppose I've dated myself with\nthat reference, haven't I...?
Ahaha, I suppose you're right. So, how's your\ninjury doing?
Ahaha, as you can see, Kurosawa-kun here's\na pretty energetic guy.
Ahaha, hold up! Your mascara's running!\nThat's hilarious! Can I take a video?

Ahaha, sorry! But you two always got along\nso well!
Ahaha, thanks for coming to my rescue!
Ahaha, you got it.
Ahaha. I'm telling you, that's what anyone\nwould think when they first see you.

Ahaha... I don't know why I blush when you\nsay we're a team...
Ahaha... I wonder if I can. Welp, I'll give\nit shot!
Ahaha... Now my stomach's grumbling. What\nshould I eat on the way home?
Ahaha... Thanks, {NAME2}!
Ahaha... We probably shouldn't. I think we'd\njust get in the way.
Ahaha... We'll have to keep a closer eye on\nour surroundings next time.
Ahaha... What can I say? I love ramen. Well, all food really...
Ahaha... Yeah, I understand. I even get\ntempted when I'm sending orders.

Ahem. We've managed to come this far\nthanks to our united efforts.
Ahh okay, no worries, then. Thanks anyway.
Ahh! It's hot!
Ahh, I can't seem to decide...
Ahh, I see, so it's like making it safely to base!
Ahh, I wanna see! I'll just have to hope\nwe run into you all in the Metaverse someday!
Ahh, I've heard of that place. They say you\ncan see a ton of penguins inside...
Ahh, Yongen... That brings me back to when\nmy hubby and I decided to move in together.\nWe were both broke back then, you see...
Ahh, ngh...
Ahh, so you must be our new part-time\nemployee, huh?
Ahh, this conversation is making me\nwant cr\xeapes! I'm totally getting one\nafter this!
Ahh...
Ahh... I can't decide...
Ahh... She'll definitely win today.\nShe just has to!
Ahh... real floral responsibilities at last.
Ahhh yes. The main shop Victory Kitchen branched off from... Pops's place.
Ahhh, 'cause you see it from a chef's\nperspective.
Ahhh, I feel like a new man.
Ahhh, I see.
Ahhh, I think I died and went to heaven.
Ahhh, I was really scared for a minute there.
Ahhh, I'm so full and happy...
Ahhh, I'm stuffed! What a satisfyin' meal\nthat was.
Ahhh, all that stress finally got to him,\nhuh? Thanks to a certain brat always causing\nhim trouble...
Ahhh, it finally ended...
Ahhh, remembering all this makes me so emotional... The soup seems somehow saltier than usual, hahah.
Ahhh, so approval from a celebrity critic made the shop famous?
Ahhh, you came to the shop the other day! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Ahhh. So that's why so few people have\nfinished. Who wrote these questions anyway?
Ahhh...
Ahhh... Another long day over!
Ahhh... Anyway, it's getting late, so I'll leave you with this...
Ahhh... So that's what it means.
Ahhh... This is exactly why I can't stand\nlittle fools who know nothing but violence.
Ahhh...!
Ahhhhh. Shaking up the food world as a\nfamous critic is just so exhausting...
Ahoom. Very well then... The other world\nyou visited is called "Mementos."
Aim for the eyes!|We'll save her for sure this time!
Aimless slacker! How much ruder can you get!?
Ain't no denyin' that there are lots of\nopportunities to be found here\u2014including\nexpandin' the range of my services!
Akashi already knew Ms. Katayama was the\nHit-and-Run Rider.
Akashi and Katayama both rule this Palace!
Akashi is crafty, and he's already wary\nof us. If we chase him blindly, we might\nend up walking into a trap.
Akashi's consulting has made the teachers\nignore the students and overwork Riko-senpai.
Akashi...
Akashi? Never heard of him.
Akechi...?
Alas, such withered desire... How fleeting\ndesire directed at oneself can be...
Alas, we are merely observers of your\njourney. Therefore, we cannot give you\nthe answers.
All I can say for now is, I strongly believe humans should embrace their desires.
All I ever wanted was to give customers authentic flavor...
All I had was the game. I had no idea what I\nwas supposed to do with my life without it.
All I wanted was real love. But I guess\nmy heart became twisted along the way...
All I wanted was to open your eyes to the\ncorrect way of the world.
All I've gotta do is hit it big. You get it,\nright?
All anyone ever says is it tastes good. But\nArai came right out and said the truth.\nWhat a badass.
All because I hit that pitch...
All because of my pride... everyone...
All because that power was sent into her...\nNow it's too...
All because you hit my game-winning slider ten years ago.
All because you hit that damn pitch! I had a slump, and it ruined my chance at the major leagues!
All by himself? Sounds like a reason to\nworry.
All compiled in their own special folder.
All devised for the sake of the customer's\nenjoyment.
All finished...
All her feelings for the ones who raised her for 20 years, gone like that.
All in good time. Now look over there.
All kinds of fabricated nonsense. I know what\ngoes in our soup, so I was aware he was just\ntryin' to drag our name through the mud.
All my fault...
All of humanity striving to overcome the language barrier...
All of it is your fault! All because of you\nand your ridiculous pride over a cheap bowl\nof noodles.
All of the dishes in here are delicious. They\nget the Yaoling seal of approval!
All of the other players are\nwatching... I don't think I\ncan back down.
All of these feelings\njust kind of bubble up.
All of this is just about himself! Like he\nforgot it's his team that won, not just him.
All of us have some things we need to talk\nabout right now.
All of us...
All of your cultivated <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>,\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>,and <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> came together.
All out of disdain for material pleasure...\nTch. Oh, and in case the internet misinformed\nyou:
All right already! We're going in circles\nhere. Mr. Akashi agrees with me!
All right everyone, let's continue our lesson on the French Revolution.
All right then! How about I start acting like\nthe adult here and take the lead?
All right then, give me the full tour! I'd\nlove to get to know Shibuya better.
All right then, let us head for school.
All right then, let's go look for Kano.
All right then, let's head to Mementos. I'm sure we'll be able to find Miyazawa's Palace now.
All right then, let's hear this important thing you want to discuss.
All right then. Let's go.
All right!
All right! Done cleaning. Thanks for helping out.
All right! Done deal!
All right! Happy to have you aboard, Lufel!
All right! Here I go...
All right! I was born ready!
All right! I'm gonna gun it! Wait, am I gonna\nget in trouble for running indoors?
All right! It's working! Let's keep it up!
All right! Let's crush these guys and meet up\nwith Joker!
All right! Let's do this!
All right! Let's get going!
All right! Let's get moving then!
All right! Let's grab some drinks and head\nto the roof.
All right! On to the next gig!
All right! That's a wrap!
All right! We're tied!
All right, I might just take you up on that\noffer. Thanks!
All right, I trust your judgment.
All right, I'll bring it here sometime.\nThen you can look and tell me\nyour impressions.
All right, I'll take a look at your technique. After you see your friends off, we can practice in the kitc\u2014
All right, I'm feelin' pretty good about\nthis. Time to give it another go!
All right, I'm gonna go with your\nrecommendation. Let's order!
All right, I've gotta win next week for sure.
All right, Kiuchi definitely saw the calling card. The Treasure should have materialized now.
All right, according to my intelligence, this\nis the spot.
All right, all right. I suppose I'll just\nhave to give you another lecture on\nviral videos, then.
All right, all right. I'm coming.
All right, all right. I'm not that much of\na boor. She makes an exceptional ally. I hope\nyou cherish her.
All right, all right. That's enough! Wrap it\nup, Ms. Katayama!
All right, all right. That's enough, Ms...
All right, all right. That's enough. Pack it\nin, Ms. Katayama.
All right, another power line down!\nWe'll have 'em all out soon.
All right, back to the shop, everyone!
All right, challengers!\nPlease take the stage!
All right, class. Today we'll be going over\nthe Age of Discovery, a time of great\nexpansion for European society...
All right, class. Today we'll be moving onto\nAncient Greece. There's really a lot to learn\nabout and from this period in history.
All right, class. We'll be moving onto the\nfour great civilizations. Today, we'll be\nfocusing on Egypt.
All right, class... That about does it for the start of the Norman Conquest.
All right, class... Today we'll be heading\nto ancient Rome. There's a famous\nexpression about Rome.
All right, dig in.
All right, done! Now for the last one!
All right, enough ramen talk! We still have\nanother Core to find, remember?
All right, everyone! Take it away!
All right, find a partner and start stretching!
All right, fine.
All right, get to class.
All right, good luck out there.
All right, got it!
All right, here I go! Watch me, Coach!
All right, here we go!
All right, hold on a minute, wait yer turn...
All right, if you're sure. Just don't push\nyourself too hard, okay?
All right, it's open!
All right, it's time to switch gears! Time to\nget groovy!
All right, just leave this to me!
All right, let's call it here for today. I'm\ngonna try to make a spicy cr\xeape at home!
All right, let's continue our lesson\non the French Revolution with the period\nknown as the Reign of Terror.
All right, let's do this!
All right, let's do this.|Hold up a minute.
All right, let's eat some sweets\nand charge up for tomorrow!
All right, let's get in some special training\nat the batting cages. I won't lose to Tamayo!
All right, let's get started with today's\nmath lesson.
All right, let's get started!
All right, let's get to the Metaverse!
All right, let's go! Get ready for some\nwalkin'!
All right, let's have you practice playing\nnotes. First...
All right, let's head over to the cage.
All right, let's jam!
All right, let's jam. Don't worry,\nI'll give you cues.
All right, let's leave it here for today.\nI'll continue on with my research of the\nparanormal.
All right, let's move!
All right, listen up.
All right, looks like you handled that well.
All right, nicely done. It fits the space perfectly too.
All right, now try calling your <color=#FF423F>Persona</color>!
All right, one more time!
All right, ready for another shift on\nthe register?
All right, see you later.
All right, shall we then?
All right, so first I need you to tell the\nlady at the supermarket to start selling tea\nin bulk already!
All right, sounds like a plan.
All right, then. Let's get started, {NAME2}.
All right, then. We'll go to my regular. Oh, don't worry. They let kids in too.
All right, then... Just one ball remains.
All right, this park won't investigate\nitself. Let's start from that ride over\nthere!
All right, today we're talking about taxes.
All right, we should all retire as well.\nGet some well-earned rest, everyone.
All right, we should get going as well.
All right, we'd better get in line too. Keep\nyour ears open in the queue!
All right, we'll need to gather information\nquickly, before we're discovered.
All right, we're all set. Let's hit it!
All right, we're playing that song again,\nthen?
All right, we've taken out the security\nsystem. We should be able to\nproceed now.
All right, you two, you're all done.
All right, {PLAYER_NAME}! Are you even\nlistening? Let's put that to the test.
All right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nI know you can get this one,\njust don't be a potatohead.
All right.
All right. Countin' on ya, {NAME2}.
All right. Go on, then.
All right. Here goes nothing.
All right. I sense the Core is close. It's\nsurely just beyond this door.
All right. I won't ask. I'll give an\nexplanation to the other teachers.
All right. I'll do it. If Haruna says I can\nsolve it, I'll solve it.
All right. I've got a few things to take care\nof first, so...
All right. In that case, let's make quick\nwork of this guy!
All right. It seems they are satisfied with\nour performance... But we must not let our\nguards down.
All right. It should be locked again now.
All right. Let's pick teams. Everyone throw\nrock or paper.
All right. Let's show 'em what we're made of!
All right. Our goal is to find the next Palace, right?
All right. Practice makes perfect! Go ahead\nand give it a spin!
All right. Shall we? I'm starving.
All right. Time to show them all how much our secret training has paid off!
All right. We've secured ourselves a medicine supplier.
All right. Well done, Wonder.
All right. You better fill me in later, okay?
All right...
All right... Now, let's hear both of your\nthoughts on this.
All right... See you later...
All right... Today's the day!
All right.|I understand.
All righty then! Let's go rent some boards!
All righty then, viewers. Allow me to\nintroduce the next game!
All righty, let's see what you got today!
All righty, that's settled. Thanks a\nbunch, sugar!
All set!|Let's run!
All thanks to your assist.|Were you setting me up to score?
All that careful work must have been tiring.\nI think that's enough for today.
All that cash and the first thing you think\nof is brushes? Man, you sure are an\nart freak.
All that knowledge she\ndemonstrated a second ago flew\nout the window.
All that to say, the yakitori each of\nmy customers eat...
All that's left is figuring out where it is and what form it takes.
All that's left is to get it ready to hand\nto the customer.
All that's left is to leave now... right?
All that's left is to solve the mechanism inside the bookshelves.
All that's missing are the boarding gates for\neveryone's personalized mech.
All the books on the counter look like\nthey're worth reading.
All the doors have been opened now. Nicely\ndone, Wonder.
All the doors... will lock in ten minutes?
All the fall of Miyazawa means...
All the fun had been sucked out of it, so I\nwanted to drink my worries away... and ended\nup here.
All the kids here look like they're having so\nmuch fun.
All the more reason for me to break them in.
All the people of this world are doing just that. Surely you can fall in with the crowd.
All the rules are on the sheet, so be sure to\nread it, okay?
All the water's gone now...
All they care about is what's new, while the old ways are forgotten more and more every day.
All things considered, our first photo\nsession has been most rewarding.
All this is to say that Saikaku was a speedy\nauthor and a best-seller too. It's no wonder\nhe's always been a star.
All this talk is making me want to grow\nsome greens of my own!
All this talk of food has got my stomach\ngrowling!
All those people will have to recover by their own strength. Tomoko included.
All those who've been abused by the\negocentric actions of people like Kiuchi\ncontinue to lose hope every day.
All to protect me... Even though it was\nmy fault!
All we need is a shooting game cabinet.
All you do is point the finger because you can't face up to your own issues. You're a coward.
All you gotta do is cook the batter, add the\nfilling, top with cream, then wrap it up.
All you gotta do is free me.
All you have to do is sign the contract passing ownership over to me.
All you women that destroyed my life better prepare to be used, humiliated, and have everything stolen from you.
All you've got to do is follow me! I'm sure\nyou'll make it to the end, no problem.
Allow me to accompany you from now on.
Allow me to explain. In the Metaverse, the strength of our desire causes...
Allow me to extend my congratulations to\nyou on my master's behalf.
Allow me to give you the full tour.\nCome along now!
Allow me to handle that.
Allow me to lend a hand!
Allow me to strum out the true emotions\nof your heart.
Allow me to take care of your heart.
Allow me to teach you the fundamentals\nof magic...
Allow me to welcome you back to the Velvet Room.
Almost done. Strike the shichi-go-san bell\n<color=#FF423F>3 times</color> in 1 turn and perform\ntwo different dances.
Almost everything is sold out now anyway.\nWhy can't they just let me go home already?
Almost there.
Almost... there...!
Along the riverside too, according to what\nI've read. I'm guessing we'll be able to\nsee it?
Already fast asleep...
Alright then, let's get to it.
Alright then.|What seems to be the trouble?
Alright! First order completed with no\nissues! Excellent work!
Alright! We did it!
Alright, I'll get it ready, and...
Alright, for getting every single question\nright, you've earned a reward! Here, you\ndeserve this!
Alright, let's do this! Don't get too scared,\nSkull!
Alright, let's head back there!
Alright, looks like that worked!
Alright, looks like you're finished.
Alright, thanks. I'm counting on you!
Alright, the orders are ready, so let's\nserve them.
Alright, then let's go. The place was in Shinjuku, right, Motoha?
Alright. I'll talk to Tanemura-san for you.\nEat your lunch before the break ends.
Alright. Time to start the second phase\nof the experiment...
Also, I wanted to talk to you about the whole\nsituation with Kotone-san...
Also, I'm always drainin' water and shavin'\nbonito flakes. I can do it in my sleep!
Also, I'm waaay too full, so the batting\ncages are a no-go today.
Also, I've seen her performing outside\nShibuya Station. I often pass by.
Also, add to that some...
Also, although we can't drink yet, there are\nsome stores that specialize in plum wine.
Also, he tried to steal the rights to the\nrestaurants he shut down, and made buttloads\nof money ripping people off.
Also, if I keep tasting what I make, I'll end\nup totally smashed by the end.
Also, isn't your house a studio apartment?
Also, it seems like this place has weirdly awful reviews.
Also, it'd be nice to learn\nmore about mocktails to\nget better at Cooking.
Also, they canceled that awful event.
Also, this <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color> he mentioned...\nthat was Ms. Katayama, wasn't it?
Also, what's with that look?
Also, you should never get too drunk. Even if\nyou're drinking to forget.
Also...
Also... buried among all those comments,\nthere were a few actual opinions on\nthe photo.
Although I do wonder... why were we just shown a video of Kiuchi's past?
Although I have a feeling that teens would\nrather hang out somewhere more fun than a\nplanetarium.
Although I'm always using my phone, I never\nknew that was possible!
Although J\xe1no\u0161\xedk was branded a villain, he\nnever took lives or succumbed to greed.
Although far from glamorous, this isn't a bad\nplace to work.
Although he rose to stardom through unusual\ncircumstances, his desire was just as strong\nas when he was an office worker...
Although her nerves caused her voice to\nshake, her singing was so captivating!
Although it's not exactly correct to say\nthere's "nothing" here. I understand that.
Although there are just so many of them,\nhe's forgotten where he hid them all.
Although this is a special space, make no\nmistake, it is still part of Mementos.
Although to me, it sounds like he's\npractically begging us to come steal the book\nright now.
Although you failed, I admired the bold way\nyou inhaled those noodles.
Always hanging out with friends in Shibuya\ninstead of studying...
Always meaning business, I see. There is\nmuch to be gained, but not without risk.\nWhat should we do, Wonder?
Always rejected... Always broke...\nAlways starving...
Am I a victim of the Hall of Lament?
Am I getting preferential treatment because\nI'm supposed to inherit Umetane?
Am I glad to see you! We could really use\nyour help right now.
Am I just losing my mind here? Everyone else seems to think it's perfectly fine...
Am I really that unreliable...?
Am I supposed to say, "Not my problem\nanymore, so whatever!"? That's bullshit.
Amamiya-kun!
Amazing as always, Wonder!
Amazing job, Russet!
Amazing!
Amazing! Doctors have to study lots, right?
Amazing! I knew you could do it, Ritsuka.
Amazing...
Amazing... You really did it!
Amber! Summer! Samba! Salad bar!
An arranged marriage? That sort of thing\nis rare nowadays. Seems like a bit of\nan anachronism, if you ask me.
An electric fence... Security's getting\ntighter as we go, huh.
An elementary school story, hm? The writing\nstyle is simple to understand, but I think\nadults can get something out of it too.
An employee showed me to\na solo karaoke room.
An epic climax needs some supporting\ncharacters as well... Heh, the star will take\na back seat for now.
An excellent choice, I must say.
An exhibition match? Whatever that means, it\nsounds like Kiuchi is at center field.
An idea?|Are you sure?
An idol?|Where'd that come from?
An important activity. I have heard that\nsleep is vital for humans to reach their full\npotential.
An interesting piece of text caught my eye\nwhile flipping through the pages.
An interesting pose, but this name has me\nbaffled. What does this have to do with\nbeing a warrior?
An interview? You guys don't exactly look\nlike a TV crew...
An item?|The root cause?
An odd app? So the Metaverse Navigator was\non your phone too?
An online world? ...I see, a transient\nelectronic realm separated from reality.
An opportunity will soon present itself...\nIf you make a bold choice, the results\nmay surprise you.
An uncharted territory lies beyond this\npoint. Wonder, could you take the reins?
Analysis... complete!
And "that damn Miyazawa"? What do you think that's about?
And I actually found a job that seems pretty\nnice! It's at a cr\xeape shop in Shibuya.
And I also can't go pushing my own beliefs\nonto other people.
And I always felt like I could see things\nnormal people could not.
And I am sure you know why, do you not?
And I am surely one source of that\nfrustration.
And I bring favorable news.
And I can't forget my mini fridge either!\nNot to mention a stash of snacks!
And I can't stand feeling like I'm being\nleft behind.
And I don't think it's right for us to act on\nthis without his consent either...
And I don't think the idea of eating ramen on\nthe go is bad at all.
And I finally got to savor that scrumptious\npork and stewed eggs. The flavor was just...\nso... exquisite.
And I got you on camera hitting a student!
And I guess I worked too hard, since I ended up bustin' my back.
And I have to get changed for gym first\nperiod! I gotta go, catch you later!
And I hope you'll be the first to listen\nto it, too.
And I know how concerned she gets. She's\nprobably worried sick about me right now.
And I know there's something you really want\nto do with your life. So...
And I promise I'll be back by the time the tournament rolls around.
And I said I don't care about things\nlike that.
And I said before, many of his victims have\nsuffered severe emotional dysregulation...\nand even lost their lives.
And I splashed soup in {NAME2}'s eyes... Sorry, I shouldn't have suggested this place.
And I was proud of him for that.
And I was sure the disciplinary committee\nchair would tear Katayama to shreds...
And I won't hesitate to fire your ass and\nreplace it with someone more compliant.
And I would like you to refer to me as Cattle.
And I would really appreciate if... um...
And I'll check with him after I take the\nphotos, just to be sure. If he has any\nproblem, I'll just delete them.
And I'll get away with it too! Because this is my Palace! Ahhahahahahahahaha!
And I'm Soy. Nice to meet you.
And I'm counting on you too, Leader!
And I'm in Shibuya all the time.
And I'm not going to college until I finish\nelementary school anyway!
And I'm not going to stop anytime soon.
And I'm not just talking about human\nproblem-solving either. Even bugs make\nsmart use of geometry.
And I'm not sure my allowance will cover it...
And I'm only worth as much as my salary\nto them!
And I've always told you not to worry about the shop, because I can hire a part-timer!
And I've got people cheering me on everyday\ntoo. Like {NAME1}-kun here!
And I, as your concierge, will continue to\noffer you the fullest extent of my support.
And Masa-san... He's my senior at\nVictory Kitchen.
And Mona loves sushi, by the way.
And Panther, and Fox, and... even Cattle's\nhere!
And Queen! Everything okay? We were\nworried since you're new to using Personas.
And a bunch of them said yes right away!
And a good person's friend must also be\na good person... right?
And a high volume of customers means lots\nof orders.
And about what you said to me, and about my\nacting.
And all I can hear is the cheering of\ntheir fans...
And although big and bold, dahlias signify\ncongratulations and gratitude.
And as a fellow chosen one, I understand.\nEveryday life just gets so boring,\ndoesn't it?
And as your concierge, I am confident that I\ncan provide you even greater support going\nforward.
And atone for my crimes...
And besides, I could tell her muscles were\nso grateful to me as we were leaving.
And besides, you have your own strengths.\nYou're fine just the way you are!
And by extension...
And by only a letter or two, no less!
And consequently, this space should also\ncease expansion.
And constantly too! And then the student\naffairs office glares at you every time...
And cough drops are on shelf 3 near\nthe checkout, as well.
And despite knowing there's no way he can be punished by law, you seem intent on finding a way to stop him.
And did you see how casually he asked for\nyour contact info? You kids really don't\nwaste any time.
And do you think you could lay a beat in\nas a fill after the first verse? Then after\nthat...
And don't be so mousy either! It's like you\nhave no passion!
And don't even get me started on the Italian\nplace in Shibuya. How did a place like that\neven open up?
And don't they have that 3D and 4D stuff now?\nTheaters are really changing with the times.
And eventually I'm gonna get you too, Motoha Arai! Gahahahahahaha!
And everyone who turned a blind eye...
And finish it up with some leg lifts! How's\nthat? Feeling warmed up yet?
And for the horrible crimes I've committed...\nI sincerely apologize.
And for the pasta as well! I would have\nmissed the opportunity to try it without you.
And for what!?
And from here on shall visit countless\ntimes more.
And from there, we'll shred our way down to\nthe bottom!
And get this, she apologized for labeling me\nan aimless slacker.
And given that we suddenly regained our\nmemories upon arrival...
And good luck with Shiho, Panther. I know\nyou can do it.
And guess whose fault that is. If you didn't\noppose my verdict, Masa and the rest of those\nsad sacks wouldn't have to be canned.
And hang on, I still don't get\nwhat a consultant even does.
And having someone fret over you while you're\nalready having a hard time is bound to get\nannoying.
And he disgraced himself in front of his\nprecious live audience. That was a\nnice touch.
And he goes to <color=#FF423F>Kiga Academy</color>...\nI think it's him!
And he promised me he would if I could get\none last contract...
And he started making waves in his first\nseason with his signature slider!
And he's trying to get her fired just so he\ncan look like some great consultant!
And her mother worked herself to the bone,\nbuilding a company from the ground up.
And here it is. The curry ramen set meal.
And here we are. This noodle place has been\nthe talk of the school lately...
And here ya have it! It's an\nexchange voucher!
And here you are.
And here. This is your pay.
And hey, if they have an opening, you should\napply! You'd be surprised at the things you\ndiscover in a job.
And how dare you disrupt the lead's critical\nscene!? What is this, amateur hour!?
And how does it feel to be in awe? I have\nmuch to learn about human emotions.
And if I spill anything, I'll be sure to wipe\nit right up. That's good with you, right?
And if I'm with you, I don't have to explain\nwhy I wanna get strong!
And if Kano-kun refuses to fight, this\nbarrier will probably change too.
And if it wasn't clear, your stolen desires are right back where they belong.
And if my prying eyes were to come across\nanything... suspicious, I'll be sure to keep\nmy mouth shut!
And if she hadn't smacked the lighter\noutta that girl's hand, you better believe\nI woulda.
And if that happens, we won't be able to\nsteal Akashi's Treasure.
And if that's our plan, the first thing we're\ngonna have to do is find our way outta\nthis place.
And if we get him roasted online in the process, I can finally get my hands on the replacement I've been looking for.
And if we press this...
And if we steal their Treasures, we can change their hearts?
And if you do
And if you end up broke, I'll give you a\nbowl of ramen on the house.
And if you spruce this place up a bit,\nyou'll be able to do even more here...
And if you were involved in a dispute with\nsomeone like that, well, I wish you would\nhave come to me for help.
And in Tamayo's mind, I was the hurdle she\ncould never jump over...
And in some cases, Magatsukami performs\nfollow-up investigations, apparently.
And in the real world, it causes him to terrorize them as the Subway Slammer.
And in your world of fading desires, they\nwill sparkle like brilliant gemstones...
And it appears his hope is being stolen as well. We should listen to what he has to say.
And it could also mean like, "We're the last stand against Kiuchi!" Kinda nice, right?
And it is my understanding that idols are\ncharming, multifaceted individuals.
And it seems he's been buying boxes like this\nafter every restock recently.
And it seems my feelings finally got through\nto them, as I eventually earned the\nwholehearted support of the young chefs!
And it seems you two have an even stronger influence on hope than I initially thought.
And it should be some good publicity for\nthe shop, too!
And it takes place in... a club?
And it'll give me new goals to aim for!\nI can't wait to see all of the competitors'\namazing tricks and try them out too!
And it'll start playing some tunes! Now\nain't that somethin'?
And it's all thanks to you! Seriously,\nI can't thank you enough.
And it's all thanks to you, Sensei. You'll\nkeep helping me out from now on, right?
And it's all thanks to you, {NAME1}-kun.
And it's important not to overcook it so the\nmeat doesn't dry out!
And it's much more fun with the two of us!
And it's not as if I can stop someone in the\nstreet to ask what they mean.
And it's not just us. The other clubs are losing members too.
And it's not like it's live TV. It's his own\nchannel, so he can have the footage edited\nhowever he wants. It's got to be a trap!
And it's not like we're just colleagues. After all, you're living with {NAME2}, Lufel.
And it's yet another Electric Barrier Door!\nTime to use a Self-Destruct Bot to...\nWait, it's gone!?
And just because I want to help you! I don't\nwant anything in return!
And keep an ear out for anything that might\nbe related to the threat.
And lastly, we have lotus seed soup.\nA Chinese sweet made with powdered sugar\nand corn syrup...
And look at this creepy icon! What is that,\na snake?
And look how handsome you've become!
And more than anything else, I'm just...\nso... tired.
And most visitors appear to have come with\ntheir significant other. Do you think we look\nout of place?
And no, you are not unconscious, per se.
And not very kind, if you ask me.
And now I can't help but see delinquents as\nsweet little old ladies. Their tough guy acts\njust lose all meaning. Funny, isn't it?
And now for the moment you've all been\nwaiting for: question time! Just ask\nme anything!
And now his treasures are hidden all\naround Tokyo.
And now my profile is full of\ntheir comments...
And now that knowledge has pretty much\nbecome common sense. All right,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san. I choose you!
And now that she's being treated like a\nMenace, Ms. Katayama seems to be in an\nemotionally vulnerable state.
And now that you know of our identities,\nbringing you into the fold would be\nadvantageous in another sense as well.
And now with our All-Out Attack, we have the\npotential to deal heavy damage to\npowerful enemies.
And now you're runnin' on empty. I seriously\ndon't get it.
And now, I don't know where my phone is.
And now, I feel like I can make that dream\nhappen myself.
And now, the taste test!
And now, you, with your distorted,\nself-aggrandizing soul, continue to steal\naway the hopes of countless others!
And of course I feel bad about calling\nYukimi-san out and troubling the staff,\nbut...
And of course there's enough for you too!\nWanna eat together?
And of course, I feel bad about causing so\nmuch trouble for you, too.
And of course, I shall continue to support\nyou as a fan.
And of course, I'll have some new tricks to\nshow you, too! Look forward to it.
And of course, this form has a much more stylish, Phantom Thief feel to it, don't you agree?
And one for you too. It's a souvenir\nkeychain!
And one more thing...
And over here we can put some shelves with\nplants. I'll help you care for them, too!
And please be aware that I may need to\nvisit your classrooms during your lessons.
And seeing as Shadows can only be defeated by Personas...
And shaved ice is like 50% tastier when you\neat while looking out at the sea, too!
And she said I opened her eyes to a lot of\nstuff at the tea party. Hehehe!
And she's a food consultant for them!
And since you helped me get justice for Tomoko, today's my treat!
And so we went to that little secondhand shop to pick out a fridge for our place...
And someday, I will uncover them all!
And somehow I dug myself out of the heap\nI was buried under.
And spin.
And spun tales of these entities, passing\nthem down through generations...
And study more... Mostly study more...\nReally study more...
And sure, you may only need arithmetic\nin daily life to figure out discounts\nand stuff...
And thank you both for coming to my rescue!
And thanks to promotion by me, this place has been crawling with customers! Everyone's raving about the taste!
And that bastard keeps sacrificing good\npeople like Ms. Katayama for his own gain!
And that coward Akashi... Controlling her\nwhile hiding himself away! I'll never\nforgive him!
And that even in this Kenko figure's time,\nsuch desires grow stronger the further away\none is from them.
And that means you're... {NAME1}?
And that somebody is the chosen one. Ah...
And that was the story of the Tale of Heike.\nIt seems that war never ends in any era...\nHow sad...
And that won't be all! It'll be filled to the\nbrim with my love!
And that would be with you. But you've been\nso kind to me, I can't do this...
And that's how you do it. What do you think?\nHope you'll try this one out yourself.
And that's it for chemical reactions. They're\npretty complicated stuff, so make sure you\ntake notes on this, class.
And that's it. You'll be fine, kid.
And that's not even the worst thing about\nwater.{PLAYER_NAME}-san, you take\nthis one.
And that's where our next target's Palace\nwill be? Good enough for me. Let's go\nright after school today.
And that's why I can't just leave my dad on his own.
And that's why I'm leaving... again.
And that's why you became a\ncelebrity critic?
And the caf\xe9's only a minute walk from the station!
And the culprits are called Menaces.
And the fact that one misstep by us could kill him... The thought alone freaks me out.
And the finishing touch...
And the more I dress myself up,\nthe more I'll be loved!
And the name of our pride and joy is...
And the person they hit doesn't seem to be\ndoing too great either.
And the producer has yelled at her before to\nquit the other job to focus on this one.
And the producer, fully aware of this,\nintends to force Naruru out at this event?
And the reason I can say that now is because\nof my coach. You, {NAME2}.
And the same applies to you, too. I'm not the\nonly one on this journey anymore.
And the source responsible for this is...
And the term "carats" strikes me as rather\nbizarre...
And the texture's surprisingly close to a\nregular omelette. Go on, give it a try!
And the timing of the academic coordinator\nand those two girls showing up to meet\nMr. Akashi was too convenient...
And the vehicle itself was no less spacious\nnor less comfortable than my car form.
And then I'll present it to the world's most\nprestigious food consultant!
And then Mementos tries to force us out... Hang on.
And then Mona went all crazy when he saw\nit. Man, I was stuck mulling over what to\ndo...
And then all the embarrassment and the\nlectures guaranteed to follow...! Bwaaaaah!
And then it turns into a fight. It's always like that.
And then the recipe gets lost to the ages.\nAll that hard work for nothing...
And then there's Ms. K, the violent teacher\nof K Academy...
And then there's this white pill, which\ndoesn't really have anything to do with this\nwhole situation at all.
And then, we'll ride that momentum all the way to the upcoming tournament!
And there are limits to what a chef can do on\nintuition alone.
And there are others like Tomoko and the girl\non TV, who go through all that suffering only\nto think giving up is the only option.
And there he is.
And there was that pitfall before. I think they might be on to us.
And there's no homework today, so I can take\na long bath and sleep like a rock!
And these rumors of people dying...\nCould that be what's in store for her too?
And they all just sounded so good... *sigh*
And they were officially condemned by\nMagatsukami. Kiuchi as the Subway Slammer, and\nMiyazawa a corrupt food critic.
And this armory has... zero shields.
And this attack was from the Subway Slammer people have been talking about?
And this dumbass symbol...!
And this here is... <color=#FF423F>Merope</color>. She serves\nas my assistant.
And this is Yukimi-san, the nicest neighbor a\ngirl could ever ask for! Hehe.
And this is\u2014
And this one appears to want to order.
And this one doesn't have a weapon!
And this produce is on sale, but it's not any\ndifferent from the regular produce?
And this space... I initially thought it\nwas a Palace that resembled a TV\nbroadcasting studio, but...
And this world representing Ms. Katayama's\nheart is, for some reason, protected by\nMr. Akashi.
And those of you who failed the experiment, keep your chins up!
And those samurai-lookin' Shadows are here,\ntoo. Does this place have somethin' to do\nwith Miyazawa?
And to Akashi of all people... It's just like\nin the Metaverse.
And to accomplishing all of our goals.
And to everyone...
And to overcome these inequalities,\nwe must educate ourselves. Under\ncapitalism, the educated will profit.
And to that end...
And to think I'd get to enjoy it with such a\nhandsome young man.
And um, Kano-kun? {NAME2} sort of\nmentioned... You're taking part in a\nFood Fight?
And underneath that skinsuit is a translucent,\nfaceless, four-legged alien with glowing guts...
And we can't meet her at school because\nshe's suspended, remember?
And we got to find out why everyone thought\nthe puzzle challenge was so hard!
And we haven't done\nfield maintenance.
And we promise to not tell anyone.
And we're holding a fan appreciation event\ninstead.
And we're not only friends, but kindred\nspirits reunited from our past lives!
And well, I guess it's a habit as an\nex-stylist, but I'm always looking at what\nhe's wearing.
And what a huge plot! I can't wait to put it\nto use!
And what about how Motoha feels?|You're being selfish.
And what about you? What's an owl doing\nwearing that weird hood!?
And what are you!? A burglar!?
And what did the third customer ask for?
And what do friends do together?\n...That's right!
And what is your name?
And what organization are they from?
And what perfect timing. I need some help\nfrom my teenage consultant.
And what's more, now with Heritage Kitchen\nalso in my hands, poor old Pops's heart is\nat the breaking point!
And what's the level of service these so-called maids give?
And when I did, I wished I'd been taught it sooner!
And when I get home I'll probably get an\nearful from Mom for staying out late again...
And when a new kind of bird was discovered\nthere, it was named "canary" after\nthe island.
And when did you two get so close, huh!?
And while I'm here... {NAME1}-kun, could we\nswap contact info?
And while Magatsukami does delete posts that\nare clearly connected to personal\ninformation leaks...
And who are you?
And who exactly are you!?
And why are you following us?
And with a code name like that, it sounds\nlike you just blink a lot.
And with that, we have successfully given\naway our code names and goals to complete\nstrangers...
And with the major league on the horizon, we've even heard word about a few potential sponsors.
And wouldn't you know it? I have just the\nthing we need!
And wouldn't you know! Now I can hear other\npeople's muscles too!
And yet, I'd choose fish any day! One vote\nfor sushi coming right up!
And yet, a thought sometimes crosses my mind:
And yet, he passed right by me when I walked in here. Don't tell me you're letting him come and go as he pleases?
And yet, it was that same bond that led the\npoliceman to rescue the crime boss... One\ncan only imagine how conflicted he felt.
And yet, neither of them seem to have any\nrecollection of Akashi's name.
And yet... I know my former acquaintance\nwill always come out on top.
And yet...\nI can still taste that coffee\nand curry in my mouth...
And yet? He's running around abusing women!? With his chickenshit shoving tactics!
And you are a student after all.
And you are?
And you don't have to worry about getting\nbucked off like with a moody horse either!
And you have your lesson too, Haruna.\nBe polite to the professor, okay?
And you help push me forward.
And you know what they say about publicity\nit's never really bad. Especially these days.
And you managed to drag your precious Pops\nand Masa-kun down with you.
And you seem to be a high school student.
And you there, in the strange hood. I heard\nyour voice coming from {NAME1}-kun's\nbag, didn't I?
And you think I want to be with you!?
And you three as well. Kano-kun, Arai-san,\n{NAME1}-kun...
And you won't believe the kind of record\nthat Saikaku set with this challenge!
And you'll be watching, I hope?
And you're here in Shibuya on this perfect\nday! I can tell you must really love Shibuya,\ndon't ya?
And you're holding the bass\nperfectly already.
And you're in luck, because mine's the best\nthere is! One bite and you can tell\nthe difference!
And you're saying Akashi,\nknowing all of that...
And you're with the orange tabby... How\nis that?
And you're, um...?
And you're... the transfer student?
And you, Mr. Akashi! I thought you had\nthe students delete the videos!
And your final score is... 100%! You've got\nsome serious Shibuya love, I can tell.
And your house is in Zoshigaya too, so it's\nperfect.
And, so... you know?
And, um, if you ever need to talk about\nanything, you can talk to me... Okay?
And, um... If everything goes to plan this time... Well, about the entertainment production committee...
And, um... There's one more thing I want to\nthank you for.
And...
And... Hup!
And... I don't think I could've made this\nvideo without your support.
And... Ms. Katayama is too.
And... You heard from my coworkers, right?\nThat I might lose my job.
And... promise me. The next time you three\nfind yourselves in any kind of trouble, go to\nan adult for help right away. Got it?
And... the day we...
And... what's that thing in your arms?
And... with everythin' that's happening...\nI just feel so exhausted.
Anderson and I read magazines\nfor a while...
Anderson and I spoke at\nlength about protein...
Anderson and I went shopping\nfor protein.
Anderson arranged a date with\nthe woman and saw her off...
Anderson seems deep\nin thought...
Anderson seems to be very\nconcerned about this woman...
Anderson's lunch box... There's only three\nthings to choose from.
Ann recently introduced me to a song\nthat is supposed to be popular right now.
Ann...
Annual contemporary art exhibitions,\npublic galleries, and a variety of\nunique displays...
Anonymous comments like that are wallpapered\nall over the internet.
Another bad guy? No, doesn't seem like it...
Another camera... But we can't get to it,\nhuh.

Another day where no one spoke to me...
Another day, another chance to enjoy science!
Another drum...\nLet's check it out.
Another electric fence...? There may be some\nhint about how to turn it off nearby.
Another electric fence? How gauche. Let's\ndestroy the nearby electrical box.
Another enemy! Let's take it out!
Another famous one would be perfect numbers.
Another intruder?
Another light? Maybe this will open the\ninner door.
Another nice day.
Another one, really? That's even more places\nwe can enter now.
Another one, you say? So were you fooled\nin a similar way by this Madarame fellow in\nhis Palace?
Another option, huh...
Another plan is to create point cards for the\nshop. Which idea do you think takes the win?
Another quiz? Irritating as it may be, we'll\nneed to answer if we want to continue.
Another ramen for me, too!
Another search for a power source...\nWhat a bothersome location.
Another self?|You mean like my...
Another shutter opened, Wonder!
Another side effect of living in a world of fading hope.
Another time, then.
Answer me...
Answer the phone.|Don't pick up.
Antacids and energy drinks\nare on shelf 7...
Anticlimactic as it may be, us chosen ones\nhave uncovered the truth together.
Any chance to change Akashi's heart would\nhave been lost, and he would be left to\nroam free forever.
Any flavors or colors you'd fancy? That's the\nbest place to start.
Any idea what that word would mean in\nmore modern terms? How about...\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
Any idea where I could plant this?
Any idea where the key might be, Wonder?
Any ideas for workouts I can do in this small\ncorner of the gym?
Any ideas to help me choose what to get?
Any ideas, {NAME2}? I need a\nvertical five-letter word over here...
Any ideas?|What is it?
Any longer and the wonderful effects from the\nbath will go to waste.
Any new twists in the plot?
Any objections?
Any other details?|Where did she see it?
Any other officer would tell you the same thing.
Any questions?
Any who oppose us shall be singed by the\nflames of vengeance...
Any yakitori man worth his salt cares about\ningredients. In fact, I tweak our salt\nand tare seasonings daily.
Anybody would be happy to receive a\nthoughtful present from you, Masaki.
Anyhoo, I'd love to try that yakiniku bowl\nsans rice sometime.
Anyhoo, how are you thinking we should proceed from here? Are there any leads we can\u2014
Anyhoo, it's interesting to hear the way\nyou think.
Anyhoo, that's the long and short of it.
Anyhoo, what's it you were sayin' about\nmakin' the Treasure materialize?

Anyhoo. Kano is in no state to stick around\nhere, so we should get back to the real\nworld and...
Anyhoodle, this is Katana Tongue Miyazawa,\nsigning off!
Anyhow, I'm going on break. I leave the floor\nto you!
Anyhow, things changed after we started\ncollege. Our bandmates all went to\ndifferent schools...

Anyone can suffer unexpected heartbreak.\nThose who study desire should bear this\nin mind.
Anyone can view it, yes. To post, you have to\nbecome a registered user first.

Anything... except questions that make me\nsound like a high schooler!

Anyway, fifth period's about to start. Don't be late, you two.

Anyway, looking for this Core\nis our priority right now...
Anyway, my nephew's new to the area, so I\nthought I'd go pick him up from the station.

Apartment 201... Looks like\nthe right place.
Apologies for cutting things short, but\nthere is someone I must keep a close watch on.\nLet us meet again at school.
Apologies for the abrupt summons. For now, please proceed the way your will directs you.
Apologies for the lateness of the hour.
Apologies, I got a bit carried away there.
Apologies, but perhaps we should call it a day. I was hoping not to stand out this much.
Apologies. I suppose I was pushing all of my\nown preferences onto you.
Apologies... Don't worry about it, I'm fine...
Apologize to Tomoko!
Apparently Miyazawa's lost before. So if it\nmeans even the slightest chance of winning\nthe shop back, I have to take the risk.
Apparently all his food reviews on TV and\nonline were total lies...
Apparently he has a dream of becoming... some\nkind of special actor?
Apparently if I don't make at least one\nmajor change, my luck is going to\ntake a turn for the worse...
Apparently it's been happening frequently...\nYou witnessed a similar incident yourself,\ndidn't you, Kano-kun?
Apparently it's inside the shop safe! It's\nsomething important to Yamagoshi-san.
Apparently monja contains lots of water and\nfiber, so that means I can eat loads without\ngaining weight.
Apparently she saw us talking with Kano-kun\noutside Victory Kitchen.
Apparently she's been an incredibly\nhard-working figure skater since childhood.
Apparently some customers have been causing\nthem trouble lately. Stuff like spiking the\nwater pitchers with spice...
Apparently the goddess of victory loves him\nso much that she even grants him the power\nof destiny.
Apparently there are seven Treasures in\ntotal. So there are five more Palace rulers\nout there somewhere.
Apparently they used to say that drinking\ncarbonated water was bad for you...
Apparently they'll show up and start going off whenever\nsomeone young sits in a priority seat.
Apparently this caf\xe9\nis quite popular...
Apparently this friend took care of him\nwhile he was living in this part of the city.
Apparently this is the "special exhibitions\nroom." We ought to begin by investigating\nthe other areas around here.
Apparently this special drink is rarely\navailable. What luck!
Apparently those three apologized to Take-kun\nafter that.
Apparently those who hear her voice meet with\ngreat misfortune.

Apparently, she's quitting her job and going\nback to her hometown. A wise move by the\nsound of it.
Appears you've gained something of import.\nShall we return home?
Apprentice!?
Arai did it.
Arai ruined his career...
Arai!
Arai-san must be really worried about\nNoge-san. I mean, they're such good friends\nand all.
Arai-san!
Arai-san!|You're alive!
Arai-san, is everything all right?
Arai-san...
Arai-san?|Snap out of it!
Arai-senpai's pretty cool!
Arai. How would you like to have a real bowl of Victory Ramen?
Arai...
Archimedes's cattle problem was posed\naround 250 BC. How many years did it take\nto get solved?
Are all Palace rulers bad people?
Are all those Shadows heading here? We're\nin trouble!
Are any of my favorite marshmallows left?
Are any of your friends older, {NAME2}? You\nmay find that you can be more frank with them\nafter all.
Are gullible little brats like you. If you\nknew how the world really works you'd have\ngiven up already.
Are people's desires being\nstolen because someone's Shadow\nhas gone berserk...?
Are the Phantom Thieves of Hearts legit?

At present, this town is a battlefield. Idols\nare present everywhere.
At some point I started becoming very\ninterested in trying to figure out their\nmeaning by listening to conversations.
At that time, I felt like I just hated\neverything.
At the bare minimum, this place needs an\nindoor pool. Ooh! How about we make one now!?
At the end of the day, all that matters is\nit's a place where we can relax.

At this point, it's all down to whether\nI feel ready or not. So, um, that's why\nI thought...
At this point, maybe it'd be better to just\nbreak things off...
At this press conference a few days prior,
At this rate, five of each is a bit too much\nfor my wallet, so I'm settling for only three\nfor now.

Baseball's the only thing I was good for, and now that's gone too.
Based on how many corn flakes were in my\ncereal this morning... {PLAYER_NAME}-san,\nwhy don't you try to answer?
Based on the Palace's interior, it would\nseem the source of Miyazawa's warped desire\nstems from movies.
Based on the location of our previous clues,\nthe one called "Panther" may be over there.
Based on the number of birds I saw outside on\nthe telephone lines earlier... why don't you\ntry to answer, {PLAYER_NAME}-san?
Based on the number of people I saw this\nmorning in red... {PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Based on what happened to Kiuchi it would seem that way. Even I cannot say for sure whether he confessed to the police.
Based on what she mentioned earlier, I'm not\nconvinced that is the right choice.
Based on your shoulder width, I think the\nsize should be right.
Basically we have to steal his Treasure, right? What will happen to him after that?
Basically what I wanted to say was,\n"thank you for spending time with me."
Basically, Divine Judgment reports people\ncommitting wrongdoings that aren't\nforbidden by law...
Basically, I'm saying we should get some secret training in by ourselves. What do you say?
Basically, he left Kyoto because he saw\nhimself as an "eunakimono." In Old English,\nthat'd be something like "cumber-world."
Basically, someone who can't read the room.\nHuh... So kids today don't know that one?
Basil is pretty nice. You can use it in pasta\nand stuff.
Bassists are like the glue that holds a band\ntogether. I'm jealous of your bandmates!
Bastard! How could you do this to her!?
Battered and bruised, the shinobi forged on,\nonly to find themselves facing a new trial...
Battling Shadows is an inevitable part of our\nongoing efforts. Having effective medicine on\nhand would provide peace of mind.
Battling prejudice and seeking\nunderstanding... Those things are still\nrelevant in the modern era.
Be careful as you handle them. They can be\nquite delicate.
Be careful then! Ren put a lot more spice\nin today's curry than usual!
Be careful with Angel and Succubus. They have\na particular set of attacks...
Be careful!
Be careful!|Stay on your toes.
Be careful, Wonder!
Be careful, it's easy to miss these problems\non tests.
Be careful, we'll be handling dangerous chemicals!
Be cautious. It feels powerful.
Be honest. How do you think Leo-chan would\nfeel about me getting so stressed over him?
Be my\u2014
Be on the alert for intruders! Keep those\nelevators guarded!
Be on your guard. I sense a powerful enemy.
Be sure to come and see me if you ever\nwant your fortune read again!
Be sure to take good care of your tools,\nas well as your plants.
Be sure to use your skills wisely!
Be true to your muscles, my friend,\nand they'll absolutely respond in kind!
Bean sprouts...? As in bean sprouts over\nplain rice?
Beat by a grade-school girl... Betrayed\nby some escort...
Beats me.|I mean, maybe?
Beauty may betray you, but muscles never lie!\nJust put in the work and you get the results!
Because European nations are so close to each\nother, there are lots of examples of their\ncultures mixing like this.
Because I can't!
Because I felt that you also believed\nin Ms. Katayama and were suspicious\nof Mr. Akashi.
Because I know him.
Because I saw him do it with my own eyes!
Because I'm not sorry for what I said. I said\nit for her sake!
Because I've never had any friends to defend.
Because Sensei is gone?|Because there's no energy source.
Because as an adult... Or really, as your\nteacher, I want to help you all in\nany way I can.
Because it's the Metaverse?|Maybe you're gifted?
Because of all that, I never felt that\nanxiety at games anymore...
Because of me, Kiuchi, the player I looked up to most, quit baseball.
Because of that, I didn't have to feel so\nanxious...
Because of you, eeeveryone gets the short\nend of the stick. It's sad really!
Because students... Children, should be\nallowed to live their lives freely!
Because that's exactly what you deserve!
Because the teachers are unreliable...
Because they only let family come to the hospital with you! Cut the trashy tabloid stuff, man.
Because they're dangerous?|Why are they chosen?
Because we're a team.|Because you're important to me.
Because you awakened your Shadow as\na Persona.
Because you were there, I was able to enjoy\nmyself without hesitation. I am glad it is\nsomething we were able to do together.
Because, well...
Because, well... I'm the type who loves\nhearing others praise the things I like!
Because, well... I...
Because... I loved it.
Beehives are made of many regular hexagons.\nWhy do you think that is?
Been a while.|Glad you're okay.
Been there, done that! I had more than my\nfill at Noir's house!
Before I can reveal your fate, I'll take\nthe cash up front, please!
Before I know it, I'm already a granny.\nThese days, there aren't many things\nI still cling to obsessively.
Before I know it, I'm right back where I\nstarted.
Before Miyazawa announces the date, let's\nall make sure we've prepared everything we\u2014
Before Mr. Akashi became a consultant,\napparently he worked at a TV station.
Before anything, we need to find a way out of here. Wonder, search the room for an exit.
Before arriving in Zoshigaya, it seems he\nwandered about from town to town...
Before coming to study abroad, Mama and Papa\nsaid to me...
Before it was a sort of medieval castle.\nAn imitation of a Palace belonging to a\nman called Kamoshida, I believe.
Before that, everyone thought things revolved\naround Earth... ...so I guess you could say\nthey had their world turned upside down!
Before then, there's something I need to look\ninto. Once that's done, I'll come find you.
Before we steal Kiuchi's Treasure, let's make sure we're all on the same page.
Before you begin, <color=#FF423F>hide your presence</color>.\nDon't disappoint Kiuchi-sama now.
Before your whole fixation on women, why did you start playing baseball in the first place?
Beginner Pond.|Expert Pond.|Master Pond.|Back.
Beginning navigation.
Behind me!?
Behold her brilliant smile, her pure voice,\nher gaze that unshakably meets my own...
Behold! Asakusa! Just look at this crowd.\nIt's like a festival!
Behold, a movie theater: a recreational\nfacility that serves as a hub of human\ndesire.
Bein' a Phantom Thief is tougher than\nI thought.
Bein' a child and all, I thought I had upset\nhim somehow.
Bein' supportive of your students is a\ngood thing! Why is she getting flack\nfor that!?
Being a member of the Phantom Thieves will surely help me grow,
Being a stuntman takes a lot out of you,\ndoesn't it? And you're still a growing boy!
Being below average might make you despair...
Being here alone is okay, but... it's\ndefinitely more fun with you.
Being in a band's the best. Nothing beats\nperforming with your buds, and seeing the\ncrowd go wild...
Being tortured only excites me more!
Being up high is super exciting, right? I can\ntell you think so too!
Believe it or don't. It makes no difference to me.
Besides, I don't need to improve my batting\nskills like I did before.
Besides, I was totally serious about\nthe pastries and baseball tournament!
Besides, I would stand no chance against enemy Shadows as an owl.
Besides, I'm not the type to mope around\nforever!
Besides, a pinch of jealousy can be the trick\nto keeping a marriage from growing stale!
Besides, do we know where this door\neven goes?
Besides, don't you think a secret hideout\ngives us more voguish charm as phantom\nthieves?
Besides, even if I'd done everything right\nand things worked out well...
Besides, if I stay here, I can teach you how to make infiltration tools.
Besides, if we don't escape now, we'll be\ntrapped in this Palace forever.
Besides, it seems Katayama's Shadow has\nfound a new lease on life.
Besides, our teeth take a ton of stress.\nWe grind them with the same force as our\nbody weight!
Besides, she's here because she loves\nbaseball, right?
Besides, this place is scary enough without\nme, right? Why do I need to be here?
Best hop to it.
Best of all, potatoes are both delicious and\nfilling!
Better get 'em before we get got!
Better get moving and take some orders.
Better go now, or I won't make it in time...
Better head to school...
Better not let our time here go to waste!\nWanna get started?
Better not. They're all the same.
Better take some time to stretch and\ncool down.
Better to have something...
Better to just come and soak in this space\nfrom time to time. Doubt I'd ever tire of it.
Better to keep away from it. Wouldn't want\nto get cooked.
Better try another game then, I guess.
Better yet, he got knocked flat on his back trying to stop it. That must have damaged his ego.
Between school and battling those shadows,\nyou've certainly overdone it.
Between the film studio and movie poster,\nI wonder what kind of desire twisted\nMiyazawa's heart like this.
Between their classroom responsibilities,\nadministrative tasks, and club advising,\nthey don't get enough time off.
Bewitched by the coffee's\nsweet aroma, I closed\nmy eyes without thinking...
Biceps, pecs, quads... What muscles are we\npumpin' today?
Big vegetables, huh. Sounds great! I bet\nthey're really filling!
Big words, pal. In that case, call me next\ntime you challenge Victory Kitchen!
Bingo.
Bit of a curveball, huh? Don't sweat it.\nIt threw me for a loop the first time\nI heard it too.
Black, milk, sugar?
Blaming others again?|You brought it on yourself.
Blast it... The floor is rising!
Blast, the Shadows have noticed us!
Blegh.
Blood can be another color aside from red\nand blue. Tell me, what do you think it is!
Bloody Mary, Screwdriver, and the like...
Blu's upbringing was not too dissimilar to\nthose poor children's...
Blunt, straightforward, a little rough around the edges... with a dead-set determination for cooking.
Boiled or fried, I'm servin' bottomless\nbowls of pain!
Bold move, but you're not getting through!
Bombing the capital will wipe out that rampaging gorilla... and the\ngovernment with it! But don't you worry\u2014I'll have this city functioning again!
Bonds?|Strengthening my heart?
Boom Bang Burger's morning set, or\nYang-Yang's AM combo... Which should it be?
Booyah!|Ready, set, go!|Here... we... GO!
Both Upper and Lower Egypt had their own\nkingdoms. While there were conflicts,\nthey gradually became integrated.
Both are suitable methods for improving\nyour <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>.
Both correlate to one's surgical skills.
Both genres are sure to sell fast, so stay on\nyour toes!
Both have their positives, so it's best\nto choose based on the situation.
Both of them are still sealed, so even I\ndon't know what's in them.
Both of you agreeing to continue is a big relief for me as well. Two business partners are certainly better than one.
Both ramen and hamburgers are restaurant\nstaples that fit that theme of "loved by one\nand all" to a T.
Bottoms up...
Boxes stacked high, as well as a lone box\noff on its own... I see.
Boy, you really tackled that bowl with gusto!
Boy, you're a shy one, huh? Should I call you\nJohn Doe?
Brace yourself, Soy! Defend yourself!
Brace yourself...
Brace yourselves. He's about to transform!
Brave samurai and countless automata await\nthem! Few will return alive!
Bravo! What exceptional service.
Break's over. Guess we should head back.
Breaking the <color=#FF423F>shield</color> might weaken him!
Breaks are important.|Would you prefer to be alone?
Brilliantly executed.
Bring it on!
Bring it!|All set!
Bringing it down may help us reach the next\narea, but be prepared for a tough fight!
Bringing your own desires to fruition... may come at the cost of hindering another's.
Bro, don't get stuck, we make our own luck!\nGive or take, no breaks without mistakes!
Broccoli is rich in vitamins, and a great\nsource of protein. It's definitely my\nveggie of choice!
Brother... The truth is... I'm a police officer,\nand I'm here to arrest you for that hijacking incident!
Brought to you from Victory Kitchen. With the\nmight of my pen, I cut through bad taste\ncleaner than any sword!
Brute force is important, but not as much\nas the Knowledge required to figure out\nhow to steal something.
Bully Naruru again and you'll have to deal\nwith us!
Buncha amateurs...
Burgers? Likely story.
Burglar.|Gentleman.|Lover.
Burnable garbage is collected\nevery Wednesday and Thursday.
Business is relatively slow today, so let's\nease into this.
Business partners?|What's the deal with this job?
Business...? What?
Busy as it was, you didn't even break a sweat.
But Akashi took Katayama-san. We gotta\nsave her ASAP!
But Closer, you executed your attack slightly too late.
But Confucius was also supposedly one of\nthe sages who contributed to the creationof I Ching divinat\u2014
But Haruna-chan's smarter than any grown-up.
But Haruna-chan's something else!
But I absolutely can't stand insects. I hate\ntheir creepy crawly little legs.
But I also realized... I can't bring back the\nwomen's pro league on my own.
But I am surprised to hear that you are\nworking two jobs. You appear to be rather\nfatigued.
But I can hear your muscles shoutin' louder\nthan any others! They're screamin' out to\nbe trained!
But I can use fools... They don't understand\nthe hierarchy at play.
But I can't be your teacher anymore.
But I can't bear to keep deceiving people\nlike this anymore, so I asked to be\ntransferred to another position.
But I can't enjoy baseball at a time\nlike this.
But I can't help it. I'm a teacher!
But I can't keep running away.
But I can't... Gotta stay strong. My favorite\nidol's new album comes out today...
But I could never wake up...
But I couldn't believe it when I saw all the\nother flavors they make online.
But I couldn't hear their support when the\nopponent's cheers drowned them out.
But I deleted it...
But I didn't realize how much you hate\nlosing, Shota-kun.
But I digress... Once again, congratulations,\nShun Kano-kun.
But I do feel bad, making you follow my whims\nlike this...
But I do know that Shun is blaming himself for it.
But I do think I know a way to bring my memories back. Namely, taking the Palace's Treasure.
But I do want to try and make something\nthey'd like, regardless of what my dad says.
But I do want you to tell me one thing.
But I don't have nearly enough time to\npractice. I shouldn't even be standing here\ntalking right now!
But I don't know if my body can take it.\nMaybe a quick rest wouldn't hurt...
But I don't know, I think the old Victory Kitchen tasted better.
But I don't mind playing the villain if it means protecting true flavor!
But I don't see Ritsuka\nanywhere...
But I don't see a way to remove the <color=#FF423F>lock</color> on\nthose chains...
But I don't see her hitting\nany home runs at this rate.
But I don't think I'll really be doing that if I leave you behind to do it, Dad...
But I don't think Taiko is... Hm...\nWhat should I do?
But I don't think that's right. I saw the\npain in your face.
But I don't want things to change for\nthe worse.
But I fear I might have ventured too far\ninto forbidden territory.
But I feel like I've finally discovered what\nI can offer this world as I am now.
But I feel like he made all my worries\ngo away...
But I feel like it tastes just a little\ndifferent. Did you use a new base?
But I feel the main one was that the public\nhated him. It's very important that you\ngarner favor with others.
But I find myself daunted by the sheer\nquantity. It must be very high in calories.
But I found a goal for myself in this world,\nso... I guess I wasn't special.
But I found some more interesting posts\non anonymous message boards.
But I found the Palace from the name of\n"Kumi Katayama."
But I got to see so many flair tricks and\ncocktails I'd never have thought of.
But I guess <color=#FF423F>they</color> cut ties with me anyway,\nso now is a good time to start over\nfrom scratch...
But I guess it is a bit unclear when exactly\nit was posed by Archimedes, so it's not like\nit was this ever-unsolvable problem.
But I guess it wasn't going to be that easy. At least we got a tie out of it!
But I guess it'll still be a while till you\ncan drink, huh, {NAME2}-kun?
But I guess teens these days don't know that\nfeeling either, huh?
But I guess the bad location keeps business from booming.
But I guess you already came all the\nway here...
But I guess you're too self-righteous to get\nthat, Kurotani-kun.
But I have no idea what "cynic one on" means.
But I have to say that I really admire the\ntraditional Japanese theme of yours, Wind!
But I have to say, showing\nyourself above that crowd\nearlier was an excellent move.
But I have to wonder... Where is Joker now?
But I haven't neglected to prepare a defense\nstrategy either!
But I heard that woman was saved thanks to my mom's treatment.
But I just can't remember the name. It's on\nthe tip of my tongue...
But I just haven't been able to get a single\nshot I'm satisfied with. To be honest, I'm\nin a bit of a slump.
But I learned a lot through all of this.
But I made a commitment. I probably shouldn't\ntalk like that now.
But I made him take out an expensive loan and\npushed him to buy things he doesn't need.
But I made it with you in mind. It's for you\nand you only to eat.
But I might have to give up on him...
But I never expected him to have no idea what\nI was talking about!
But I packed it with all the ingenuity\nI could muster. And I think the flavors\naren't too shabby.
But I powered through it because I wanted\nto see him. If I could just recapture that\nfeeling, I'd be invincible!
But I quit. I had some bad experiences when\nI was in dance, you see.
But I read my old copy so many times it's\nfalling apart.
But I realized I could busk on my own, so I\nthought I'd try that...
But I realized that I didn't do that when I\nlost to Tamayo the other day.
But I really rely on and look up to you\nso much! Like, a lot!
But I should ask just in case, are you resolved to continue tracking down Kiuchi?
But I should be fine now!
But I still wanna have free time to chill out and go to the movies and stuff.
But I struggle with big men. They scare me.\nSo I ended up confessing everything instead.
But I suppose now is as good a time as any. I'll show you the best way to knock down the enemy.
But I suppose there are some ramen shops that\nare all about making their food look flashy.
But I swear I've seen her somewhere before...
But I think I figured something out today.
But I think I've realized some things after\nall of this.
But I think it might be faster if I showed\nyou what kinds of pictures I take.
But I think people don't even notice they\nhave things like that they want to say.
But I think the main thing was that Ryoko\njust quit playing music one day.
But I think we should do something Yuma wants today, since we played Mei's game yesterday.
But I think we'll go far if we take it slow\nand steady. Former U.S. president Roosevelt\nsaid similar.
But I think {NAME2}'s still got some! Would\nyou mind givin' some to Shige-san?
But I thought this Palace had collapsed after\nwe had done so.
But I used the Metaverse Navigator, went to the Palace, and saw everything with my own eyes...
But I want to investigate Mr. Akashi to find\nout why this situation occurred in the first\nplace.
But I want you to remember this.
But I wanted to ask you...
But I wanted to come here with my hubby for beer and gyoza tonight...
But I wanted you to try my ramenburger 2.0\nfirst...
But I was curious what's in this\nlittle bag...
But I was incompetent. I couldn't fulfill\nanyone's dreams!
But I was smart! I talked them into giving\nme a ten thousand yen bill before I left.
But I will say the way Kiritsubo is described\nin the textbook doesn't get me very hype,\nif I'm honest...
But I would hate to sully your ability to\nchoose for yourself.
But I wouldn't say I dislike that side of the\nculinary experience here.
But I'll admit, I detest violence myself.\nSuch dirty business is best delegated.
But I'll get paid if I win the competition,\nso I'll just have to swallow my doubts as\nbest I can.
But I'll try my best, just like I will with\nthis basil.
But I'm a shy person at heart\u2014or maybe faint\nof heart is a better way to put it...
But I'm a terrible, selfish, unfair teacher.\nI'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry...
But I'm a total beginner...|I don't feel ready.
But I'm actually pretty good at them too.\nAnd with a hint, it's easy. The answer is...
But I'm afraid that's not right. They never\nused wood. The reason is because it\nrots quickly.
But I'm afraid the answer is Esperanto.\nAround a million people speak it, and yet...
But I'm already full...
But I'm glad I came across like that. Thank you.
But I'm glad your teacher gave us permission.\nThis seems like a great place to play.
But I'm gonna focus on the Phantom Thieves\nfirst! I wanna be able to throw myself back\ninto baseball at full strength.
But I'm gonna start getting back into shape.
But I'm gonna win back way more than what\nI sold it for. It was an investment, right?
But I'm happy we can study together in peace\nwithout having to worry about others.
But I'm not a fan of people telling me that\nI turned out like this because of when I\nwas born.
But I'm not at all, you know! We've just\nhappened to own a house there\nfor generations.
But I'm not going to forget about our old\nband, no matter what.
But I'm not just gonna pack it in after that.
But I'm not really in a position to help them...\nso I was wondering if you might be\nable to help them instead!
But I'm not, I promise. See for yourself.
But I'm open to all of your opinions!\nPlease feel free to get in touch with me!
But I'm really grateful that you did. It was so good to have you here.
But I'm still figuring out some bits, like\nthe outro and the chords leading into the chorus.
But I'm still not convinced we can rest here safely. I'd like to poke around a bit more just to be sure.
But I'm sure the two of us can deal with\nwhatever comes our way.
But I've actually never tried buying one of\nthese myself.
But I've also heard distance has no relation\nto languages. Hoohoo... Maybe you should take\nthis occasion to learn another language.
But I've got a serious case of jelly legs...
But I've never released an original song I\ncomposed for the world to see.
But Leo-chan's still young. I'm sure he'll\nburn it all off in no time.
But Magatsukami has never officially confirmed what the selection criteria are.
But Motoha... She was there for me through all of it. Comforting me, encouraging me...
But Mr. Akashi's password opened the door\njust now...
But Narumi's busting her ass, and he still\nkeeps most of her paycheck.
But Riko-san is...!
But Riko-senpai... I wonder where all this isn\ncoming from.
But Ritsuka and I should have told you\nbefore. It is an option to quit if you really\nwant to.
But Shota never plays with us anymore!
But Shun, you don't need to get involved\nwith him anymore.
But Tomoko...!
But actually, I'm more interested in the\nperson inside that suit.
But after chatting for a while, I'd never see\nthem again!
But after elementary school, I'll be\nattending college in America.
But after having interacted with those who\ncome to different conclusions?
But after taking all that time to craft it,\nit seems like a waste to just throw it away.\nSo... do you want to take it?
But after talking to you today...
But after talking to you, I'm starting to\nfeel excited about the future.
But all I know is baseball...
But all that effort's bound\nto pay off eventually.
But also...
But any of the students here would\nimmediately know that it's Ms. Katayama.
But anyway... You always used to say you wanted to be a nurse...
But are we really ourselves only after we\nlet loose with some alcohol?
But as curious as I am to see what a day in\nthe life of Sensei looks like...
But as it stands, the real Katayama won't\nsuffer any ill repercussions.
But as you can see, I'm getting on in years.\nI'm in no shape to be running all over Tokyo\nthese days.
But at our shop the producer takes most of it\nfor himself.
But based on the chance of rain\ntoday... Let's double-check with\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
But based on what we saw at the Palace,\nMiyazawa's intent to crush Kano is real.
But because I didn't give up, and I reached\nout to you, now here we are!
But before I head off, I've gotta keep the\npromise I made to you.
But before we go... I wanna pick your brain\na bit.
But before we issue the calling card, there's something I need to confirm with you two.
But being fine is pretty stellar in my book.
But boxes of flowers and potted plants weigh\na ton! And making bouquets is exhausting.
But by "power source," you mean...
But by then it'll already be too late!\nKano-kun's going to get hurt before we can\ncause the change of heart!
But children need adults to look out for\nthem. If he doesn't feel safe at home...
But compared to other people, I'm a bit of\na slow walker.
But considering the challenges we're bound\nto face in the Metaverse, I'd rather prepare\na way to access medicine and treatment.
But conversely, the slightest mistake could\nendanger everyone.
But could you please play along so we can change their minds?
But did Motoha not say she was concerned\nas a fellow girl?
But do hippos really weigh that much?\nThey'd flatten you in an instant!
But do not bear those burdens alone.\nMy door is always open.
But do you think that Leo-chan could secretly\ndislike me?
But does this mean that everyone carries\naround iron in the winter? Quite amusing\nwhen you think of it that way.
But doesn't that make you want to help keep\nhis morale up, or at least try to?
But doing that won't be enough.
But don't be alarmed. I promise it's all on\nthe up and up!
But don't feel bad! I've still got prizes\nwaiting for you.
But don't get me wrong. It's not the staff's fault.
But don't let comfort turn to neglect.
But don't think you can just sit and memorize\nevery idiom. There are way too many to\ndo that.
But don't worry. In terms of world famous\nawards for math, there's still the Fields\nMedal!
But don't you need to keep quiet?
But enough about my ideals for an\nEsperanto-speaking world. For now, let's just\ntry our best to study English this year.
But enough jokes. Congrats! You're right!
But essentially, I am an educational\nconsultant brought here to improve\nKokatsu Academy.
But even if I lose, I'd just be some stupid\nkid who made a fool of himself. I won't cause\nany trouble for Pops or the staff.
But even if it were to change to something\ncompletely different to my current outfit, I\nhave the feeling I'd really embrace it.
But even simply owning such a wonderful\nthing will surely result in something good, though...
But even so, I can't just leave you in this\nsituation.
But even though it always felt great in the\npast... Lately, for some reason...
But even with the mystery solved, it seems\nTake-kun is still under threat.
But ever since Miyazawa got involved...!
But ever since we found out Haruna-chan got\ninto college, Ito-kun stopped playing\nwith us.
But everyone here is so nice, I feel much\nmore comfortable.
But everyone starts from zero, so don't take\nit personally. I'll cover for you where\nI can.
But everything's gonna be okay now! I know\nwhat to do.
But first, I still need to honor that promise\nI made with you.
But first, just give me a minute, okay?
But for the first time since then, I finally\nthought...
But from now on, I'll try to make time every\nday to keep our crops healthy!
But from what we've just seen, her desire is\nbeing condemned, forbidden, and warped.
But further ahead, the warped desires\nI'm sensing lack a human's willpower...
But getting reactions from so many people\ndid give me some good motivation.
But given its original meaning, I can't help\nbut feel taken aback when people use it\nlike that.
But he always buys me these ridiculously\nfancy Japanese sweets and stuff.
But he always gets smooth! Isn't that so sad?\nWe don't even know each other's preferences.
But he always says he's busy, so we haven't\nseen each other even once since then.
But he can be a bit indecisive.
But he finally gave in in the end. And just when I was thinking, "Can I really go on living with a man like this?"
But he never actually visited Japan, it's\nsaid that he heard the name passed on\nincorrectly through word of mouth.
But he only just got here.\nYou think something happened between them?
But he wants you to know that he truly can't\nremember where he hid any of them.
But he was dozing off before I even knew it!\nI can't believe it's been so long since I was\nlast here.
But he was fuming when he left. He'll\nprobably try to stir up some kind of\ntrouble again.
But he was... truly worried about me.
But he'd even be a handful for those divine beings he mentioned earlier...
But he's hiding somewhere! How are we\nsupposed to stop him!?
But he's never gonna be like Nishimori,\nno matter how much he studies.
But hearing what Chizuko-san has to say\nmakes me feel a whole lot better.
But her homeroom teacher in second year was\nreal sympathetic to 'er.
But here's a question for you! What is it\nthat I want to eat?
But hey, I should count myself lucky in a way. I know that other people have it a whole lot worse than I do.
But hey, as long as we're having fun, right?\nThat's what matters.
But hey, just look at these noodles.
But hey, we've got the internet in the modern age, right?
But his is the first I've ever seen with its own Palace, and so deeply infected by desire I might add.
But his own crew told him off, and kept him\nfrom calling the police.
But his ugly side\u2014or I guess I should say, his real personality\u2014is something else...
But honestly, I only scroll through the site\nto kill time so I don't really know much\nabout it.
But how are we going to get to it all the\nway up there...?
But how is it visible? We didn't send out a\ncalling card, did we?
But how thou\u2014
But how will Planet Earth survive without\nits moon...?
But how're we gonna get to the next area?
But if Akashi's showin' up in her Palace,\nhe must be a big deal to Katayama-san in some\nrespect.
But if Coach {NAME2} recommends it, then I'll\ngive it a try.
But if I actually went abroad, I might get\ntoo nervous to talk to anyone.
But if I can't be myself, then there's no\npoint in me being here!
But if I do manage to write one...
But if I do nothing and then she quits figure\nskating for good, well...
But if I have you,{NAME2},\nI'll be just fine!
But if I mention I used to play baseball,\nthey always ask what pro team I like!
But if I run away from this... it means I'd\nbe responsible for ruining Pops's ramen.
But if I'm going to get the same opinion,\nI should get it from someone I can trust,\nright?
But if I'm reading something to have a good\ntime, why break my heart!?
But if I'm right, do I stand to win all these gold coins!?
But if either seeks supremacy...
But if everyone acted upon that right\nin this natural state...
But if the Phantom Thieves become well-known, would that mean we could save more people?
But if the Phantom Thieves were to do something... No. The Phantom Thieves are the only ones who can do something.
But if this Motoha Arai's desire is real, then it seems your fates will intertwine. Hoohoohoo...
But if we hadn't met...
But if we ignore Akashi, more people will\nfall victim.
But if we lose, I don't know if we'll ever recover our confidence.
But if we'd met just a little later, I woulda\nbeen loving it up all over the place!
But if you ever change your mind, don't be\nshy. We'd love to have you.
But if you want to head straight for the Palace, that's fine as well. If so, I'll give you a lift.
But if you win, I'll give up on you and\napologize sincerely to your coach. Sound\ngood?
But in many cases when it rains in the\ndesert, a year's worth of rain falls\nin a single day.
But in reality, he only thought of me and his\nother students as mere tools.
But in spite of all this, there is a kid out\nthere claiming Victory Kitchen's current\ntaste is not true to the original.
But in the Metaverse...|His Shadow was...
But in the end, all those people who tried\nto crush me...
But in the end... we couldn't stop him from\ngoing to the Food Fight...
But is this really the time for casual\nintroductions? This all does feel quite\nsurreal.
But isn't it weird? Why was he the one\nprotecting Ms. Katayama's Palace?
But isn't this whole place locked up?\nHow're we supposed find a key here?
But it closely resembles others we've seen.
But it does allow you to run come rain or shine.
But it does trouble me to know that I don't\nhave the... dignity that comes with age?
But it feels like he's expecting big things\nfrom me, you know? Leaving this here and all.
But it feels like something much worse\nthan that...
But it looks like SOMEONE's already cleaned\nhis plate.
But it looks like our challenger has their\nown new gadget! A Self-Destruct Bot!
But it makes me happy I can use my\nknowledge to support Mr. Higashino.
But it seems like Divine Justice's getting\nreally popular.
But it seems like when she fell on the tracks she... messed up her shoulder pretty badly.
But it seems my mediocrity never left an\nimpression on you...
But it seems that Ms. Katayama continued\nreaching out to students she was\nconcerned about.
But it seems there is no way for us to get close to it.
But it seems these ones have lost their\nintellectual desire.
But it turned out to be some kind of\nsuperhero show! I don't know a single thing\nabout this stuff!
But it wasn't that simple in the end.
But it'd be too easy for me to crush you now.\nLet me know when you think you're ready to\ntake me on!
But it's a lot of stuff for one person to\ncarry... Would it be too much trouble to\nask you for help?
But it's a shame. The texture would be better\nif the ingredients were cut larger...
But it's a way to pass the time.
But it's been a long time since we've\nreally had a chance to talk.
But it's been so long since I've written\nmusic. Wonder if I've still got it in me...
But it's dangerous to go out anywhere...
But it's fun! Like solving a puzzle!\nThe professor told me that's a good way\nto think of it.
But it's good to have the desire to be\ncharming. Never back down and give it\nyour all too, okay?
But it's guarded by Shadows...
But it's kind of bland if you just boil it\nin salt, right?
But it's not as intense as a Palace, so it's\nactually kinda cozy here.
But it's not like the people who hate the\nMenaces do anything to stop them, either.
But it's not movin'... Is it broken?
But it's probably quicker to just try them\nthan to listen to me explain.
But it's so much more fun having someone to\ntalk to!
But it's still kind of vague. I need to think\non this some more.
But it's true you can find the "good stuff"\nin there too! You make your own choices now!
But it's true, right? Arai did come to school afterward.
But it's very likely that they'd never met.
But just because you've perfected somethin'\ndoesn't mean it can't still be just as good\nin another form.
But just for my own peace of mind, I'll emend any clumsy wording.
But just knowing that a rule exists can make\nlistening a lot easier.
But just what does this thing symbolize?\nFill me in if you know.
But keeping in mind that our actions may be\nbeing observed... We should maintain a degree\nof caution in our virtual communications.
But knowing that from tomorrow, I can step foot in the station without that hanging over me... makes me so relieved.
But lately I've been thinking of other\nthings too. Like all the fun times we had\nin the band.
But lately all my apprentices
But lately, even when I lie down to rest,\nall I can think about is my customers.
But launching a coordinated attack like that was awesome. Kinda takes me back to my baseball days.
But let's go back to probability\ndistributions. Okay, everyone look at\npractice question one...
But let's not be discouraged. We'll just\nshake it off and find the next subject.
But let's not put the cart before the horse.\nHere ya go, as promised, {NAME2}.
But let's put aside such dark tales for now.\nLet us turn our discussion toward recent\nevents in countries abroad!
But like I said, my photos are all about\ncapturing change.
But listen to me preaching to the choir. As\na full-time student you must know that better\nthan anyone.
But listen, I'm always here to give love\nadvice! Just leave it to moi!
But look at this one. Isn't that the movie\nyou said you were curious about?
But look! I finished my first part-time job!
But maybe I can stop him from the Metaverse, as a Phantom Thief.
But maybe I did something that made him\ndislike me...
But maybe I'm being a hypocrite...
But maybe it's not. I still have my\nsuspicions, but at least it's over with.
But maybe something sweet would be best to\nfill you up after all that browsing.
But more importantly, we need to save Motoha Arai!
But more than anything, he loved to see his\ncustomers enjoy his food.
But more than one sounds hella confusing.\nI don't think I could deal with it.
But much like a bird of prey, I'll call the eggs an appetizer...
But my ability to make friends did not.
But my family can't live on this pay alone,\nso I have to work multiple jobs.
But my friends at school are all into some\nother stuff... Nobody ever wants to play\nthe games I like.
But my mom's an ER nurse, so there were days\nwhen she wouldn't get home till long past\ndinner time.
But my sports physician said it was all about\nwhen and how much you drink.
But never mind that! Look at the farm! Did\nyou do all this yourself?
But no home runs yet...
But no need to panic, this can be <color=#FF423F>healed</color>!
But no one really comes up here, so we\nshouldn't have to worry. Plus it's nice and\nroomy.
But no one treats us differently, so it's\nalways nice to spend time with everyone.
But no pain no gain, right!? Fatigue now,\nmuscles later.
But no. It's a big stick, or military might.
But not as a street performance. The only\nperson I want to listen to this song is you.
But not here... Let's go somewhere else! We\ncan grab a bite and chat at the diner!
But now I have my wonderful sensei to help me\nfigure it out, so I'll think on it real hard!
But now I realize there are other kids with\nproblems completely different than mine.
But now I think maybe he'd had it in Niigata\nand thought I should try it.
But now I understand. And it's all thanks\nto Anderson-san.
But now I'm going to focus on getting better.
But now I'm running out of space and my\nparents want me to get rid of them.
But now he admitted his guilt, like he was a\ndifferent person. And that was all... after\nyou found out about this.
But now that I'm stuck in the hospital,\nI have no way to help him...
But now that I'm writing my own lyrics,\nI think I finally get it.
But now that I've made up my mind, I'm gonna give this everything I have.
But now that you're here, {NAME1}-san,\nI can go in with confidence.
But now the question is, who's going to draw\nit? I myself wouldn't know where to begin\nwith detailed work like that.
But now the training is finally starting to\npay off.
But now you're like a different person\nentirely. It's like you found a purpose.
But now... I'm a better player than you.
But now... there's no way I could do that.\nAnd not because I'm physically weaker.
But of course that was just a silly ol' accident, right?
But of course, they're not perfect.
But our victory was the natural result of\nutilizing strategy.
But people are more complex than you may\nthink. I'm sure even Menaces had extenuating\ncircumstances that led them astray.
But people got cursed for a lot longer\nthan you might expect.
But perhaps I am pushing this on you.
But perhaps Mandrin himself would have said\nit was worth it, to live true to\nhis desires...
But perhaps it's wiser to find a way to\ncompromise with others in a way that also\nbenefits yourself.
But perhaps you've still learned about true\n<sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> by seeing its opposite.
But photographers do need to be responsible.\nAfter all this, I'm sure I won't forget that.
But please allow me to invite you both to\none of my favorite places in return for your\nkindness.
But please don't misunderstand. I don't think Shun did anything wrong.
But please don't say anything to Motoha, okay? I don't wanna burden her with it.
But rather, a longing to eat... A certain\ncraving, if you will.
But registration is quick and doesn't ask\nfor that much info. It's a low barrier\nfor entry.
But right before she started elementary school, her mom passed from an illness.
But right now we're in the afterglow of our triumph over Kiuchi. I'd hate to spoil it with what I have to say.
But rumor has it she was a kunoichi all along.
But saying I can't do anything because of that was nothing more than an excuse.
But seeing you at my side...
But seeing you here helps. I'm glad I get to go to school again.
But she does so out of necessity because\nshe holds herself and others to a higher\nstandard.
But she has to learn super formal English\nso she can write essays and stuff.\nIt sounds tough.
But she promised to contact me again when\nthings settle down. That's good enough for\nnow!
But she said she felt too weighed down by\nfamily stuff and worries that she wasn't\ntalented enough...
But she said she'll probably have to quit\nthis job so she can make enough money for\nher family.
But she said she's not going to dwell on it,\nand she won't let that kind of stuff hold her\nback anymore!
But she still prepared my lunch for school\neach and every day.
But she struggles with insects, doesn't she?
But she truly cares for all of her students.\nWe can't let that creep treat her like an\nenergy drink anymore. Right, {NAME2}?
But she's so absorbed in\nthe song, I can't tell if\nshe's noticed...
But skipping over middle and high school to\ngo straight to college... It's too far away.
But slipping and getting covered in scalding\nhot coffee would be even worse...
But small problems can really weigh you down when they start to pile up.
But so are you. Show them where all that secret training got you!
But soccer's an 11-person game. Kadota and I can't win on our own.
But some of them are a bit odd...|Why is there a bottle cap?
But somebody could've been seriously burned\nif she hadn't gotten involved.
But somehow, it seems the better part of my memories vanished when I entered the real world.
But something's not right...\nIt looks like she's pleading\nto him with tears in her eyes.
But sometimes I even get lost in the parks.
But sometimes I get this, well... chill down\nmy spine, you know?
But sometimes even I forget the name of a\nrestaurant as soon as I walk through the door!
But sometimes phrases mean more than\njust their words. I'm talking about idiomatic\nexpressions and slang.
But speaking with Noge-san, I realized\nI don't have time to spend feeling down!
But starting today, I will be retiring from\nall media platforms.
But still, this is all because I was too\ncareless. I really regret it.
But still... I want to try. Thank you,\n{NAME2}-kun.
But surely you can aim even higher. Please\ncopy each of these poses perfectly.
But thank god! I was sure Taiko was gonna\ngo back to her old band...
But thanks for all your help anyways!
But thanks to that little surprise, I finally\nmanaged to sing my song.
But thanks to that... I was able to develop\nmy palate...
But thanks to you, we made it through.
But thanks. I appreciate you saying that.
But that Palace represents the convergence\nof two individual's desires, with Akashi's\nShadow acting as a parasite.
But that also makes it feel like I'm on my\nway to work, so I try not to hang out here\nmuch.
But that barricade is blocking our path.
But that building's ancient and it doesn't get any light...
But that doesn't change the fact that this\napp helped change Miyazawa's heart.
But that doesn't mean I should pull any punches. After all, it has nothing to do with flavor, right?
But that doesn't mean she has a Palace,\nright? She's not like those other two!
But that doesn't mean they should abandon their hopes completely.
But that doesn't mean you can overlook the\n"forever loved" part of the theme.
But that meant anyone could pick up. It was\nsooo awkward when his mom answered!
But that wasn't all.
But that wasn't what I was looking for.\nMesopotamia is the correct answer.
But that wasn't what I was looking for.\nThe answer is Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk.
But that's different. I mainly wanna use this\nas a chance to unwind a little bit.
But that's just the way it goes, so I usually take care of it all myself.
But that's not the only reason no one\ncomes here...
But that's not the only reason.
But that's not what you really want to do, it's what you think you have to do! Am I wrong?
But that's not why I'm leaving.
But that's only possible because of all the\nsupport you've given us.
But that's when it dawned on me...
But that's where this here Den Maker comes to\nthe rescue! I'm positively sure it's all you\nneed to make your Den a home.
But that's...
But the aroma of coffee still lingers here.\nThe beans must have been high-quality.
But the bassline's the same as what we came\nup with last time at your school.
But the comments had nothing to do with my\nmotif of "change," or the photos I took...
But the cram school teacher said his grades\nare already good enough to get in!
But the demon could not be completely erased.\nTherefore, the hero sealed its corpse away.
But the doctor told me I can't leave from my bed...
But the door's locked...
But the elevator wasn't working...
But the feeling...\ngradually subsides...
But the flavors complement each other\nperfectly!
But the heat of it was shocking!\nIt was more than spicy\u2014it was\nsomehow revitalizing!
But the idea of someone else deciding my\nentire future for me...
But the internet works too fast. People\nalready screenshotted it and were spreading\nthe picture around.
But the job's not over quite yet. Let's find\nthe next electrical box.
But the lab had already fallen out of use\nback then.
But the last one left is a true gem.
But the more you know, right?
But the only way I can enjoy that sublime\ndish again is to rent out the entire\nrestaurant...?
But the orders got mixed up, and this is a\ntotally different character's shield!
But the plan stays the same! Dodge Kiuchi and go for the Treasure!
But the question was written wrong!\nIt's unsolvable! That's why we don't have\nthe stamp!
But the real fight's still ahead. Are you\nready, {NAME2}?
But the real hard part about winter\nis the wind. Cold wind really drains\nyour energy.
But the real motivating factor is money.\nNothing can be done without it.
But the results of my last health checkup at\nwork weren't so great...
But the same old scenery gets boring.\nSometimes I'll try a new location, and then\nof course...
But the second cartoons were on the\nscreen, they'd stop in their tracks\ninstantly!
But the time you will know it is further still.
But the wafer ones are good too.\nPerfect when you're only a little hungry.
But then I heard the mighty voice of powerful muscles screamin' out to be heard...
But then I remembered shooting games.
But then Miyazawa showed up... and\neverything changed.
But then Ren subjected me to the smell of\ntoday's curry! So now it's like what other\nchoice do I have... None, right!?
But then he looked all melancholic. Or maybe,\nawkwardly disappointed?
But then the outlaw turns it all around!
But then you invited me, so I took off for\nlunch break and here I am.
But then! I, Katana Tongue Miyazawa, whipped this place into shape!
But then, one day...
But then, the cr\xeapes from this shop cheered\nme right up!
But there are limits. It's bound to run out\nsooner or later.
But there are some fights I can't let myself\nlose.
But there are times when the show looks for\nmore diverse actors of different builds\nor height.
But there aren't many people causing an\nuproar in the real world on the same level\nas Kiuchi and Miyazawa.
But there must be something we can do about it!
But there were some circumstances on our side...
But there's a grate blockin' the way up, we\ncan't get through now...
But there's no kitchen here, so all we can\ndo is have you mimic the movements.
But there's no need, because I have you as\nmy wonderful personal trainer by my side!
But there's no telling when this place could\ncollapse as well. We should leave at once.
But there's no way everything could work\nitself out that easily.
But there's no way he'll get a fair shot...\nDamn it! I wanna help him, I just...
But there's no way she can do that because\nno matter how many hours she puts in here,\nshe still won't make much.
But there's not much time until the deadline\nfor my report... I might just have time for\na single test.
But there's plenty to admire of an unnamed\nhero who battles on alone with no one to\ncheer them on!
But there's something strange about them.\nIt's like there's noise making the voices\njumbled up.
But there's still some time before she\ngets there, so I'll give my lats that pump\nI promised them and head over.
But there's sure to be a way to lift it!
But these aren't their true forms. They're\ninfluenced by someone powerful in the real world.
But these days I get so many I've run out of\nplaces to display them.
But these days they're all busy and we can't\nget our schedules to line up.
But these roads don't just lead to Rome.\nThey extended all the way to France, England,\nand even Africa.
But they have their fans too\u2014or should I\nsay, their followers.
But they ordered food...|I'm sure this is the right place.
But they said on the news it was just trash from some bird. It doesn't have anything to do with the case.
But they stuck somewhere, in some dark corner\nof my heart. Then during rehab, they started\ngetting to me.
But they were both such wild kids back then,\nyou'd hardly recognize 'em.
But they were here just a sec\u2014!
But they're my friends.
But they're not moving...
But they're not very good yet, so it's still\nway more fun to play against you.
But things can get confusing when you look\nat the data. So why don't we review how to\ndo that?
But this area does seem to be linked to the source that stole your desire.
But this character is a warrior who carries\na sword and shield...
But this door looks like the only way ahead.
But this guy... I guess he got obsessed?\nHe kept coming to events to criticize me.
But this is quite the tangent from your\ntextbooks. Let's get back to solving\nequations.
But this number of long-time, dedicated\nemployees suddenly being incriminated right\nafter Akashi arrives...
But this orange tabby is quite different\nfrom the other neighborhood cats.
But this snake isn't biting its tail.
But this theory was supported until the birth\nof morbid anatomy in the 19th century.
But this time, experience will guide us.
But this trick will optimize your workflow,\nso keep it in mind.
But this was different. Losing wasn't\nthe end.
But this will be a good opportunity. You ought to learn how to earn money for yourself.
But those foolish intruders from the other\nday wouldn't dare return. Heheh.
But those reported on by Divine Justice\nare known as Menaces to the public.
But through willpower, you can intervene\nand change things, so "destiny" is used to\nrefer to the unknown.
But tilling alone won't make our crops grow.
But time just seems to fly by when I'm\ntalking with you, {NAME2}-chan.
But to be frank, they're quite jumbled.\nI think I may have been... wrong.
But to do that, we'll need to steal\nKatayama's Treasure and invoke a change\nof heart.
But to me, it's not really about the\ncompetition aspect...
But to some extent, these are the same\nproblems all social media sites have.
But to think I was spotted distributing the calling cards...
But to think that someone was eavesdropping\non us. Some hideout this is.
But to think there were other\nPhantom Thief groups out there...\nIt really is a small world!
But to work there even part-time... Kano-kun\nmust be really into ramen.
But unfortunately, I have no experience going\non dates with women... Do you have any good\ntips, friend?
But unlike last time, at least it's all\npositive reactions.
But unlocking the new area of Mementos\nmay have also had an effect.
But wait, this is Heritage Kitchen, isn't it? Why does the soup taste like Victory Kitchen?
But wait, what about words that also have the same nuance...?
But wait, what about you? Who's this guy you're interested in?
But we always needed to start the elevator\nto make progress, right?
But we are absolutely buying meat on the way back. It is not up for debate!
But we can talk about that some other time.\nLet's go eat some sukiyaki!
But we caught on to them too late.
But we couldn't keep that up forever, so\nwhen I went to tell him how sorry I was...
But we did come all the way out here. If you\nwanna hit, go for it, {NAME2}!
But we don't have to trade or anything...\nAh, but... maybe I would like to...
But we have math to thank for even the most\nmundane little parts of our lives, you know!
But we haven't fought a single time! Even\nthough he's been with us for a while!
But we haven't got these weird-ass gates\nlifted yet.
But we just made it back.|Wouldn't that be dangerous?
But we must be careful. The calling card will\nonly reveal the Treasure for a day.\nThat means, once we send it...
But we never let go of hope. We find new\npurpose for ourselves, put all our energy\ninto chasing it, and keep on living.
But we won't be able to do anything until we can get up there.
But we won't know what to do with you till we've seen what you're made of.
But we work in a lot of shops around Shibuya\nStation.
But we'll have to defeat it if we want to proceed... Up for the challenge?
But we'll need a workbench to make them...\nwhich I'll assume you don't have, based on\nyour expression.
But we're just on our way to get dinner...
But we're losing time, so I'll keep the explanation brief.
But we're not without recourse! The Shadow\nhimself gave us the hint we need.
But we're running out of time! I wanna play\nthe game my teacher showed me!
But we're talkin' about how to make a curry\nroux here.
But we're talking about hunting here, so...
But what I really want to do is hear him out,\nencourage him, cook him something tasty!
But what about Ms. Katayama!?
But what about her?|I can't leave her like this.
But what can we do here... We might have\nenough room for some quick sprints.
But what do they revolve? The fish or the\nrice? Hm? By the look on your face... both,\nbut surely not!?
But what do you think I should prioritize,\n{NAME1}-kun? The lyrics or melody?
But what do you think he wanted to hear?
But what does it matter what I want?\nEverything my mother does is for my sake.
But what flavors do I think are best? The\nmore I think about it, the more I don't\nknow...
But what if you could? Wouldn't that make\npeople happy?
But what is it you find mysterious\nabout wind?
But what is there that I can even change?
But what of my ramen?
But when I decided to call it a day and let\nmyself unwind, it's like all the fatigue\njust melted awaaay.
But when I find myself battling hunger,\nprotein bars are there to save the day!
But when I happened to log back in...
But when I sit down to write something,\nI just can't pick a thing to work on.
But when I stopped and thought about it,\nI haven't done anything to thank you,\nhave I?
But when I watch it, I guess I'm not\nthinking about wanting to be up there myself.
But when I'm exhausted, I'll sometimes switch\nthe flavor up with some jasmine tea.
But when she badmouthed you... I just got so\npissed.
But when the day comes that we can finally play together again, I'm gonna give it back to her.
But where do I even get the ingredients?\nWhatever, I'll figure it out!
But where there is a vault, there is\na treasure chest. It's our duty as Phantom\nThieves to push on.
But where though...? Is it only visible to you?
But who's lining them up? Today, there's even\na continuation of a series I read recently...
But why a castle? Do you think the inside's actually a huge ramen shop or something?
But why a dam? Is this a memorable place for\nher or something?
But why a film studio? Does it have something to do with Miyazawa's desires?
But why do they both have a Palace in the\nsame place?
But why do you like Shibuya so much? I really\nwant to hear all the details on that one!
But why was Papa so eager for me to study\nabroad?
But why would cognitive beings connected\nto Kiuchi be in a place linked to Kamoshida?
But why? Isn't that Ms. Katayama's\nown cognition?
But will any company even hire me?\nWhat am I supposed to do with my life...
But with a grate in the way, damn...
But with all his hope and passion\nfor acting...
But with us working together, we can tackle\nanything that comes our way.
But without it, we could've voided the deal.\nWhy would he give this back to me?
But working here now is totally different\nthan what I imagined as a kid.
But wow, it must have been quite the task\nto prepare all of this.
But y'know... Your mom was a pretty smart cookie.
But you can see how well that's going...
But you can't build courage without pushing\nyourself, or something, right?
But you can't seriously think that's enough to call the guy a Menace, do you?
But you could also say it makes me versatile.\nI could fit a lot of different roles.
But you finally figured it out... Wallowing\nin guilt isn't going to change anything!
But you gave it your best.|We having a postmortem?|It could've gone worse!
But you have to keep to a very strict diet\nto be a figure skater.
But you know, chilis didn't come to Sichuan\nuntil about 500 years ago.
But you know, what they call pop music\ntoday was at its height even when I was\na kid.
But you listen to me, {NAME1}-kun.
But you managed to create a new change\nwithin it. A hopeful one.
But you meant "a nurse like mom," huh?
But you said that you can't fly in that form,\nso I wondered if you could fly in real life.
But you seem like a good guy, {NAME1}-kun,\nand you didn't turn down Tsurumi's forceful\nrecruitment tactics either.
But you should be careful. 'Cause your entire shop's riding on you keeping me a happy camper. Got it?
But you should know better than anyone...
But you use that badass shotgun, too, right?\nThat's impressive, if you ask me.
But you were cheering for me too! I just\ncouldn't be happier!
But you won't take my money? Hmmm...
But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone\nwho knows what a momme is. Units can get\nreal complicated real quick, huh?
But you'd better be careful of parks\nwith ginkgo trees!
But you'll never know what something's really\nlike without trying it for yourself.
But you're a bit off the mark. The answer is\nthe liver. To be precise, melancholy is the\nbile secreted from there.
But you're always acting natural. You don't\nput yourself down to praise others.
But you're no longer my homeroom teacher,\nso you don't need to worry about me anymore.
But you're welcome to take on the\nUniverse-sized Ramen again anytime\nyou like. It's on the house!
But you've been supporting me like this\ndespite that...
But you've seen how I am with directions.
But you... You awakened your Persona through your unquenchable thirst for life.
But your generation so loves to categorize\nthings based on their superficial\nappearances...
But your room is just so gloomy with nothing\ninside!
But {NAME2} was the one who taught me that! Hahaha.
But!
But! I need to train...
But! These days I've been hearin' people's muscles less and less.
But, I don't know, I just feel like the\ngeneration gap is wider than ever these days.
But, I don't really have a proper,\ndistinctive autograph.
But, I made it through with <color=#FF423F>Senpai</color>'s\nsupport!
But, I think we've found ourselves a rather\ndecent base in the Metaverse...
But, I'm probably just remembering it wrong. It's been a long time since I last had it.
But, I'm still worried! What if he got caught\nup in the wrong crowd?
But, Riko-senpai, is it true that you're\nbeing called in to settle arguments?
But, before we look for Palaces, there's somewhere I want to stop by first.
But, despite their limited relationship,\nthey did collaborate...
But, even as an aspiring costumed stuntman,\nI can't just talk to them if they're on\nthe job.
But, for a person to be as willing to face danger head-on as she...
But, if we can't...
But, if we did have a monkey here in front\nof Shibuya Station...
But, if we keep working at full capacity\nlike this, the dam's likely to burst...
But, is that a bad thing? Do people prefer it\nwhen others aren't serious?
But, it's a bit of a detour going from my place\n to Zoshigaya.
But, it's your most precious desire,\nisn't it?
But, like, art is the stuff you see hangin'\nin museums, right?
But, no matter the combo, only your tongue\ncan be the judge! I think that's wonderful.
But, no! You know, actually, it's not\ntechnically lost... yet! If I find it, it\nwon't be an issue, so...
But, no, the answer is "a task no one wants to do."
But, of course... There's no guarantee, so\nit's a high-risk, high-reward situation.
But, seeing someone so young work hard\nreminds me that I have to work hard too!
But, sir...
But, that's just the first question out\nof three!
But, that's\u2014
But, this is Katayama's Palace, isn't it?\nWhat's a thing like that doing here in\nthe first place?
But, we're minors. Won't we get arrested\nor somethin'?
But, well... I am a little worried if it'll go well or not. If the timing works out...
But, while social withdrawal and lack of care\nfor one's appearance can somewhat\nresemble Diogenes...
But, yeah. I guess we did do something pretty great, huh?
But, {NAME2}! Don't you forget to put some roasted pork in your bag for me.
But...
But... Because I had friends by my side...
But... But... This is my big chance!
But... Do you really think they'd prescribe medicine to us despite not being injured or anything?
But... Hahaha...
But... I did it, didn't I? The mystery of the\nAssassin's Juice is solved!
But... I wanted to at least talk to you since\nyou know so much about muscles.
But... I'll be okay.
But... I'm just so...
But... It seems like whenever I try, my urge\nto sing just fades away.
But... Of course, I'm still getting\nnervous...
But... That doesn't fix the fact that he\nstole the shop and changed the soup.
But... We're totally fine! We'll get through\nthis one way or another!
But... When I stop and think about it,\nthere's nothing I really want to do in Japan.
But... Why did Miyazawa set his sights on Victory Kitchen in the first place?
But... how?
But... in the end I still couldn't figure out what to do.
But... recently, I've just had this urge to\ncome here again.
But... there was an incident, and she felt responsible for what happened. She ended up quitting because of it.
But... there's no way I can go back to being a pro...
But... there's no way that'll be enough.\nIs that really okay...?
But...!
But...! But...!
But\u2014
But\u2014 Wait. Maybe it's best coming from\nanother boy his own age.
But\u2014! I only found out today! I woulda\ncome the second I knew!
Butter my biscuit, looks like you're able to\nget through! I just knew you had a special\nconnection with this place!
Buuut, if you're really that insecure, you don't have to compete. I'm more than happy taking the shop here and now.
Buy|Not now
Bwahahaha! Even his brain is dense like a\nmuscle! See? It went just as I said it would.
By "face and figure of excelling beauty,"\nwhat is Kenko saying is desirable?
By awakening your Personas, you faced the Shadows embodying your desire head-on.
By cleaning every nook and cranny, your\nconscientiousness will reach new heights.
By cleaning up even more thoroughly, your\nconsideration will surely flourish.
By continuing to efficiently defeat enemies,\nyou'll be able to adapt to anything.
By deciding to continue with\nthe Phantom Thieves...
By doing so, we can ensure we access\nMementos from the entrance.
By doing so, you safeguarded the hopes and dreams of many, and with it, their will to live.
By eating what I like today... I can give it\nmy all tomorrow!
By following the listed amounts and steps,\nthe same taste can be recreated at any store.
By now the Palace's security has certainly tightened, and it will take time for us to come up with a plan of action.
By sending the calling card
By studying their mentality and aesthetic\nsense yourself, you can also develop your\ncharm as a Phantom Thief.
By taking on this job together, you and I\nwill become business partners.
By the by, there are certain items that can\nonly be found here.
By the synthesis of these personalities through Fusion, a new personality is born.
By the time the station attendants showed\nup, the rider was already gone.
By the way, Cattle. Have any more memories\ncome back to you?
By the way, Closer, do you think you\nwouldn't mind putting me down anytime soon?
By the way, I also saw some sort of fundraising drive in front of Shibuya Station. I wonder what their goal is...
By the way, I finished the lyrics for the new\nsong! The main melody is mostly done too.
By the way, I heard from Musubi that her\nbasil is growing nicely.
By the way, I heard that the crops we'll be\nharvesting are cyber radishes.
By the way, I'm not taking no for an answer.
By the way, Kano-kun. Ms. Katayama was\nworried about you when she saw the video.
By the way, Kiuchi's Palace being a baseball stadium...
By the way, Senpai, what was Akashi's\npassword? How'd you figure it out?
By the way, are you doing anything after\nthis?
By the way, are you into running, too?
By the way, based on those uniforms I'm guessing you two go to Kokatsu, right?
By the way, does it mention anything about\nan owl constellation? No? Are you sure?\nLook again. Surely there must be one!
By the way, if you happen to see Shun, tell\nhim to stop by and see me, all right?
By the way, is it just me or was\nMs. Katayama super chill today? She took\nShun's excuse without batting an eye.
By the way, is it just me, or did you have a little too much fun with that?
By the way, my owl form is quite modish,\ndon't you think?
By the way, the protagonist is modeled after\nAriwara no Narihira, the biggest playboy\nof the time.
By the way, there's a trick to ringing\nup items.
By the way, was Closer able to get justice\nfor the friend she mentioned before?
By the way, we also hold events sometimes.
By the way, what do you usually have for\nlunch?
By the way, you and your friend's servings\nhave less lard in them, Shun.
By the way, your outfit is really cute,\nRiko-senpai. It looks amazing on you!
By the way...
By the way... About what the boss was\nsaying...
By the way... Today will be the first time\nI've ridden this with someone else!
By the way... You know how you just talked\nabout this "Treasure-like thing"?
By the way... You really know how to attend\nto an older woman, don't you? Hehe.
By the way... can I ask you something?
By using the <color=#FF423F>Self-Destruct Bots</color>, you can\nbreak through its defense.
By using the Palace
By who?
Bye Minami!
Bye bye!
Bye-Bye Burger|Boom Bang Burger|Big Dog Burger
Bye-bye!
C'mere, sweet pea! I got somethin' to\nshow ya!
C'mon back once you're old enough to drink.\nWe can have one together if I'm still around!
C'mon guys, we're a team. Now let's go\nfind that Core!
C'mon now, Ayaka...
C'mon! Hurry up!
C'mon! No matter how I drunk I get, I'll only\never show you my cool side.

C'mon, fam, don't ask me how I am!\nYou know I'm great! Always first-rate!\nNo need to update!
C'mon, have a little faith in me. The only\nthing weird about it is how it looks.
C'mon, hurry up!
C'mon, let's go!
C'mon, let's make a deal.
C'mon, potatoes! Get it together already.
C'mon, that's not even close to <color=#FF423F>50</color>!\nGet it together!
C'mon, we gotta run!
C'mon, you both even have similar\nbody language...
C'mon, {NAME2}-chan! Hurry up!
C'moooooon then, try me! Bring it, babyyyyy!
C-Cram school! Bye!
Caaattle! You can't say mysterious stuff and\nthen expect us to forget about it!
Caf\xe9 Leblanc? Hm... By the looks of it,\nthis establishment is closed.
Call for Mr. Akashi or another teacher\nif that happens! Or get Tanemura-kun to help!
Call it a Yumi Special: Mocktail Edition.\nHehe.
Call me Cattle. {PLAYER_NAME} goes\nby Wonder.
Call the old man.|Maybe later.
Call upon my name, and release thy rage!
Calling card?
Calling it the "true" soup is all part of the branding. Got it?
Calling me a fake... I showed them what a\nfake truly looks like! Ahahahahahahaha!
Calm down, Closer. Those are cognitive\nbeings, not real humans.
Calm down. That will be impossible to do in\nonly ten minutes.
Calm down.|She's right.
Calm yourself. Did you not hear what Mona\njust told you? Those are cognitive beings\nwho\u2014
Cameras here, too? There's something off\nabout this.
Cameras! Check the security cameras!
Can I ask you something?
Can I ask, who are you exactly?
Can I come here again?|Is this place open to minors?
Can I drink this...?|You know I'm a minor, right?
Can I get in on this plan of yours?
Can I get you to help with cooking today?
Can I have five fried potato mochi, please?
Can I help you with something?
Can I help you...?|Have we met?
Can I reach it?|It's so close...
Can I really eat this much in one sitting?
Can I request a song?|Teach me to play guitar!
Can I say, {NAME2}...\nI'm kind of curious what sort of outfits\nyour Phantom Thief group wears.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Can I tell you something?
Can I use your place to whip up some\ndesserts?
Can do.|This is a special, one-time service.
Can he sense my Persona?
Can my work bring smiles to customers' faces\nlike my father's did?
Can other people not see\nthat door?
Can they use their <color=#FF423F>powers of transformation</color>\nand observation to escape? Or are they stupid?
Can this guy even get the ball into the net?
Can we go talk for a bit, then?
Can we still not get the prize? Do we need\nto go get the stamp?
Can we talk for a moment?
Can we talk?
Can we watch it?
Can you believe a piece of trash like that\nworks at a school!? Now it's our turn to\nteach him a lesson!
Can you believe these? They're so rad!\nShe's like fashion incarnate!
Can you believe this lush? He couldn't possibly have a broken bone...
Can you give me a little spin?
Can you give this to Shota-kun for me,\n{NAME2}?
Can you handle this?|Cover us!
Can you hear it? That's the voice of my\ndemonic blade, aching to drain the lifeblood\nfrom your wretched bodies!
Can you lay everything down, and let\nfate decide?
Can you name the woman who, despite facing\ndiscrimination, won two Nobel Prizes?
Can you play any instruments besides bass?\nOr are there any you'd like to try?
Can you rewrite it from memory?
Can you sense this noble aura? In that case,\nI shall become a mask and lead you on...\nFollow me.
Can you seriously just accept that!?
Can you spare a minute?
Can you speak cat?|Help me out here.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
Can you tell us what set of merchandise best\nrepresents Kiuchi-sama as a star pitcher?
Can't ask for much more than that.
Can't beat golden age movies.|I prefer modern flicks.
Can't deny that.|Guys do, too.
Can't forget to mention his rival too!
Can't give an immediate answer, huh?
Can't have you going soft and complimenting\nhis food during the fight. Go on, get out.
Can't he calm down a bit? His enthusiasm is\nputting a damper on my mood.
Can't say I know much about that. Tell me\nabout it some time.
Can't say I've ever been a fan.
Can't say for sure. You know, I've been struck by him at Shibuya Station before.
Can't they tell they're in the way?\nSomebody should get a teacher.
Can't wait to see you drunk.|Bet you're quite the handful.
Can't we leave all the book crap\nto the nerds? They actually like it.
Canceled. Over. Your performance is still lackluster as ever anyhow.
Captain Kidd!
Capture the intruders!
Care to join me?
Cared more about the other person?|Blamed herself for it?
Careful, it's pretty heavy.
Careful, there's a Shadow ahead.
Carmen!
Carve your path to victory!
Case in point, he had copies of the footage\ntaken by those two students stored on his PC.
Cases are up since last year, and officials\nstrive to promote a healthy lifestyle.
Cases of class-based discrimination, unequal\nrights for women, and inequitable court\nrulings were prevalent.
Cat... poop?
Catch you guys later.
Catching him could have landed me a promotion...
Cattle looks like an animal of sorts, just\nlike Mona, right?
Cattle, do your thing!
Cattle, if you don't mind.
Cattle-san, are you certain this is\nMs. Katayama's Palace?
Cattle-san... It's nice to meet you. Does\neveryone else have code names too?
Cattle...?
Cause that brat's gotten on my last nerve. Screaming "real" this, "authentic" that...
Causing a change of heart is a risky act that forcibly reshapes the target's mind.
Cavendish was a big inspiration for me.
Central Street, right?|Where are we going?
Certainly my austere appearance is too beguiling for the everyday household to handle.
Change Katayama-san's heart...?
Change of heart?
Change...? Hm, let me think...
Changing Kiuchi's heart? Do you know what that means, {NAME1}-kun?
Cheating isn't the solution! To find the key,\nall you need is knowledge of the game!
Check it out. I got these seeds! But I don't\nreally know where to plant them...
Check out all the sweet treats! Rice\ncrackers, dango, even baby castellas!
Check to make sure|Keep walking
Checkmate.
Cheers!
Chef! What are you doing waiting out here?
Chemistry.|Mathematics.|Literature.
Cherry tomatoes and edamame. It's actually\npretty fun.
Chief? Is that your owner or something?
Chizuko appears to\nbe sleeping...
Chizuko gave me an earful\nof her various\nwitty complaints...
Chocolate.|Fruit Blend.|Custard.
Choice?|Guest?
Choosing to stay in Wonderland... I see.\nFarewell.
Circles are the shape with the shortest\nperimeter. The closest to them of the three\npolygons I mentioned are...
Circling back, there's no reason\nMs. Katayama could ever know his password in\nthe first place.
City life sure has its surprises.
Civilization was founded along the Nile\nRiver, and there were kingdoms up and down\nthe river.
Cleaning... I'm not very good at it... Maybe\nI could mop the hallway at least...?
Clear your mind, and choose a tarot card...
Climax after climax... This is the true\nessence of a silver screen actor!
Clocks, calendars, maps... All of it is thanks to math.
Closer told me all about you.
Closer, Wonder, and Cattle, huh? Well, that\ngets the formalities out of the way!
Closer...
Clothes! They're wicked cool!
Clothes.|Character shops.
Club's got me so burnt out.
Coach, back me up here. This kind of conduct is indefensible, am I wrong?
Coach, can't you push him a little harder?
Coach, huh...?
Coach...
Coconut Kato is my hero.\nHe's the best bodybuilder out there!
Code name?
Code names?|Why?
Coffee flowers mean "let's take a break."
Coffee's the perfect thing when you want\nto relax for a moment, right?
Cognitive forms with Persona-like power...\nI never could have imagined such a\nthing exists.
Cognitive forms?|They aren't real?
Cohort? That sounds super old, Lufel.
Cold medicine is on shelf 1...
College or work?|Never thought about it.|A reasonable degree of happiness.
Colloquially, it means you can pick whatever\nkind you want.
Come again soon.
Come again.
Come along, Wonder!
Come and challenge me if you dare, cowards!
Come and get it, you sticky-mitted rug rats.
Come at me. I'll stop you for sure this time!
Come back anytime!
Come back anytime.
Come back next time and aim for the top!
Come back soon!
Come back when you get the chance. You're\nalways welcome here!
Come back whenever you're free!
Come by Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku too!
Come by sometime when you're old enough to drink! It'll be on the house.
Come by whenever ya feel like workin'\npart-time.
Come closer. Don't be shy now!
Come forth!
Come forth, <color=#FF423F>Awilda</color>! Let's take back\nwhat's ours!
Come forth, <color=#FF423F>Robroy</color>!
Come forth, Goemon!
Come forth...
Come look at this!
Come now, enough nonsense...\nSeriously, you lot...
Come now, {NAME1}-chan. It's lonely being\nthe only one to pose for a photograph.
Come now. Enough nonsense. This is\nenemy territory.
Come on already! We don't have time for\nlong goodbyes here!
Come on dad, you know this place isn't big enough to afford to hire anyone...
Come on you two. Back to the shop! And kids\nwho fight get no juice!
Come on! Don't just stand there blinking at\nme! Start throwing out some ideas!
Come on! Hurry up!
Come on! More traps? Just how heavily\nguarded is this place anyway?
Come on! Swashbuckling shopping and\ntea-sipping adventures await!
Come on, I can't take it! Just clue us in a little.
Come on, I'll walk you to the station.
Come on, I'm sure Wonder must be tired too.\nHe's always busting his butt as leader.
Come on, Kano-kun. Let's head outside!
Come on, Takamaki-san's waiting.
Come on, Wonder, try it!
Come on, everybody. Let's practice our dance moves to ring in the New Year!
Come on, let's go eat. She's just making broad guesses that could apply to anyone.
Come on, say it with me!
Come on, this way! Follow me.
Come on, we're some of the only ones who\ngot them! These are super ultra rare!
Come on, what are you worried about? This is the best way to guarantee Kiuchi gets the message!
Come on, you're the violent Ms. K of\nK Academy! Now give those kids a good beating!
Come right in and take a seat. What should I\nmake you today?
Come stay at our place!
Come to me!
Come to me. Become my power...
Come to the faculty office when you arrive at school tomorrow.
Come to think of it, I can't do anythin'\nother than what Pops taught me.
Come to think of it, I do recall hearing that\nyour parents are away...
Come to think of it, I have urgent business\nto attend to as well. Let's look into it\nnext time.
Come to think of it, I remember Pops always\nsmiling whenever he opened it...
Come to think of it, I saw someone steal an\numbrella right out of the stand the other\nday. How's that for a Menace?
Come to think of it, I saw\nsomething on TV the other day.
Come to think of it, I was\nable to help her without that\nstrange feeling from before...
Come to think of it, I\nwas walking around there with\nLufel on my shoulder earlier.
Come to think of it, Kiuchi's Palace was\npretty odd too... it was a weird stadium.
Come to think of it, a cat\ncame to play in the garden\nthis morning.
Come to think of it, no one's\ncleaned the house since\nthey left...
Come to think of it, the first time we ran\ninto each other was in Shimo-Kitazawa,\nwasn't it?
Come to think of it, wasn't I\ntold to nurture desire to\navoid ruin?
Come to think of it, we are still yet to\ndecide on our Phantom Thief names.
Come to think of it, when I passed by\nthere earlier...
Come to think of it,\nthat horror movie had a place\njust like this...
Come to think of it...
Come to think of it... Pops would often take\nsomething out of there with a big grin\non his face.
Come unwind with a massage or one of our\nacupuncture treatments!
Come unwind with a massage\nor one of our acupuncture treatments!
Come visit as much as you like, whenever you\nlike! You're always welcome here!
Come with us.|Just trust us.
Come work another shift when you're\nfree, okay?
Come, let the training of your mind begin...
Come. I ask that you observe my conversation\nwith Naruru.
Come. It is time to unleash your potential.
Come... Let us race through fields and\nforests, and dance across the sky!
Comestibles are food. I am referring to your\nafternoon meal break. Do humans no longer\nuse that word...?
Comin' right up!
Coming from someone at my age, it's hard to\nkeep advice from sounding preachy.
Coming from you, {NAME2}, it really does\nfeel like things will be okay.
Coming through!
Coming to Japan to study doesn't mean I have\nto follow their way of doing things without\nquestion.
Coming to this park always helps me relax...\nThanks for coming along with me.
Coming!
Commodore Perry.|Kenichi Nagara.|{PLAYER_NAME}.
Companio...? What does that even mean? Um...\nwhat should we do, Wonder?
Compared to "destiny," is "fate" more\npositive or negative of a word?
Compared to that little space, it's more\nlikely lost somewhere in the school.
Compared to you I'm just aimlessly drifting through life. Haha.
Compared to you, it's barely anything.
Comparing power levels...\nNo threat. Get 'em, Joker!
Complete quiet isn't for everyone. Studying\naround others seems to suit you.
Completely her fault.
Compose yourself. It isn't real. It's an\noptical illusion.
Conclusive evidence has proven so. There's\nno doubt you are a true friend to me.
Configuration complete. Access to the guide\nis now restricted.
Confucius said not to speak of the unknown,\nbut studied divination. Is this\ncontradictory?
Congrats! You did it! So you solved the last\nquestion, huh!?
Congrats!|I wanna hear!
Congratulations on your perfect score!
Congratulations! A new Player None is born!
Congratulations! You beat the Extra\nLarge-sized Challenge with flying colors!
Congratulations! You beat the Large-sized\nChallenge!
Congratulations, Shun Kano-kun! You're now\nofficially a condemned Menace!
Congratulations. Well done.
Consequently, please forgive my boldness,\nas I designate names for each of them.
Consider it my way of sayin' thanks for\ngussying up the place.
Consider it thanks for hanging out with me\nall day, Sensei!
Consider public executions in England and\nFrance. Even people in Edo Japan apparently\nheld similar spectacles.
Consider this a dream fulfilled!
Consider this place a tunnel in a sea of souls, paving the way to the innermost depths of your heart.
Consider yourself lucky. There aren't many places
Consideration...
Considering how I am with directions,\nthat's a plus!
Considering the band couldn't exist without\nyou, it must've been hard to refuse.
Considering the magnitude of his heinous\ndeeds, it is likely that this producer has a\nShadow in Mementos.
Considering you live alone, everything's\nsuper neat and orderly. I'd expect no less\nfrom Sensei, of course!
Consulting...?
Contact with students outside of class is\nstrictly prohibited. How many times must you\nbe told?
Continuing to fight isn't a good idea!\nWonder, give us your orders!
Contra...dictory?
Conversely, we, compelled by our intense\ndesires, force them to have a change\nof heart.

Correct. Nothing gets past a detective\nlike you, I see...
Correct. They are manifestations I have\nconstructed from cognitions buried deep\ninside your heart.
Correct. You have visited this place\nonce before.
Corrupted desires...
Could I ask you to do that now? Since Dad and I both have time.
Could I have a minute? I need some advice!
Could I use this place for running or\nweightlifting? You wouldn't get mad,\nwould you?
Could be.
Could be.|I doubt it...|Sounds delicious.
Could he be drawing their attention to help\nus out?
Could it be...? Panther!
Could it have something to do with Naruru!?
Could the Romans' desires have spurred them\nto be so? Desires truly drive people\nto improve...
Could there be an accident or something?
Could they be...?
Could this be the elevator control room?\nLet's see if we can find some sort of\nswitch nearby.

Could you watch the register in the\nmeantime?
Couldn't call this spicy where I come from.\nMore like mild I guess. Tasty, though.
Couldn't have done it without you behind\nme, {NAME2}.
Couldn't it be possible to <color=#FF423F>destroy</color> this too?
Count me in.|I'll pass.
Countless victims in all directions.
Cram inside, there's no time!
Crap!
Crap! I've got butterflies in my stomach!
Crap! There's no road!
Crap! We're cutting it close.
Crap! We're gonna stick out like sore thumbs\nif we get to the gym late!
Crap, Miyazawa just posted an update...\n"Today's Food Fight challenger has arrived!"
Crap, did you just hear all that?
Crap, they're right in front of the goal!
Crap. Now we'll actually have to play games. What a pain.
Crazy to think I said that to one of the\nguys who changed Kiuchi's heart.
Creates villains?|Finds scapegoats?|Succeeds at others' expense?
Croquettes, I guess?|Shimokita's all about curry bread.
Croquettes? Sounds great! If my memory serves\nme... my hubby and I used to love those.
Crown, grant me power...!\nMore, MORE!
Crumble before me!
Cultivating your knowledge and intelligence will be critical to our work as Phantom Thieves. We must refine ourselves.
Cumbersome.|Encumbrance.|Cucumber.
Curious about her?|Don't tell me... you like Motoha?
Curious, are you? *chuckle* Very well.
Curious, isn't it?
Curry and ramen, huh...|I've never seen this before.|Can we finish all this?
Curry with coffee... I still think\nthe combination is odd, but\nI've gotten used to it.
Cursed Eye of Time, huh? And it's a "demonic\nart" this time?
Curses, it's a trap!
Curses, that was the wrong order!\nWe've been discovered by the enemy!
Curses. They knew we were here all along!?
Cus you ate too much.
Customers ask about their meanings all the\ntime when you work at a florist.
Customers pressed for time opt for takeout.\nThey don't have the time to sit down and eat\nin a relaxed place.
Customers stare at you if you wear anything\nunusual to work...
Customers these days are so impatient...\nYou only stand to lose if you give up\nso quickly!
Cut it out, you pervert!
Cut the power? You mean beat Akashi!?
Cute, you say? I take it you are trying to\nflatter me. Very well, you may hold me in\nhigh esteem.
Cuuut! Just cut that part out! Okay,\ntake two, roll camera!
D-Does it? I mean, doesn't everybody care\nabout their mom?
D-Don't get the wrong idea!\nI'm helping the Phantom Thieves for my own sake!
D-Don't look!
Daaargh! What're you doing!?
Dad and the regulars drink it every night\nlike it's really delicious or something...
Dad's still having back pain, so I'm going\nout to buy some things for our shop.
Dahlias.|Red roses.|White lily of the valley.
Daily life can be just as dangerous,\nof course. Make sure you always\nwatch where you're going.
Dammit!
Dammit! I didn't finish the math homework\nfor Katayama-san!

Deal with her.
Dear Mr. President! What do you get when you piss off a psychotic AI idol\nthat's been abandoned by the internet and treated like malware?
Dear lord... That's definitely the Subway Slammer. Menace in the flesh.
Dear, I don't have much longer... But I need you to understand\nthe difference between what's real and what's in your mind...
Death, Reversed
Debate.|Exercise.|Nothing.
Deception, loss...
Decision?|What are you talking about?
Deep down, I feel like\nI somehow recognize\nits presence...
Deepening your bonds with others will profoundly influence the strength of your heart, that of your Persona.
Defeating enough foes within the level\nshould weaken the boss. Let's do that first.
Defend the basement at all costs! Do not\nlet him in!
Delicious...?
Delinquent brats who rely only on brute force\nshall weep! For they are powerless!
Delivery!
Depending on how the person perceives\nthemself, their Shadow can appear vastly\ndifferent than how they look in reality.
Depends on how it tastes.|Going for the weirdest entry?
Depths of your heart? Me come from there!
Descent into ruin...?
Desire that can be gleaned from names, is it?\nWhat a refreshing way to look at them!
Desires you don't act on are meaningless\nto others. We should always remember that.
Despite her outward demeanor, she was rather kind. Is this the path she spoke of?
Despite his difficulty\nspeaking, Shun taught me\na recipe.
Despite how cool you two act, you really do\nlike brute-force solutions...
Despite how things turned out, I hope you'll\ncome along with me again sometime.
Despite my best efforts to give everything\nanother once over before handing it in...\nI'll need to try harder going forward.
Despite society's biases against women...
Despite that obvious hypocrisy, do you still\nthink we're doing the right thing?
Despite that, I went in guns blazing without\ntaking a second to think about her feelings,\nand made her really upset.
Despite that... I still need to talk to her.
Despite the mishap,\nMerope looks thrilled.
Detectives are such ambiguous creatures.
Devote yourself to achieving consistent\ngrades that won't bring embarrassment on our\nname. Understood?

Far too many to handle at once... We'll have\nto avoid fighting here.
Farewell then.
Fast way to lose your memory.|Drink till you drown?
Faulty circuits?|It does seem strange.
Fear not. Use the <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>, <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>,\nand <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> you've honed in battle...

Feel free to reach out if you ever need me.
Feel free to stay the night.|Let's play till dark.
Feel free to stop by the caf\xe9 and have\na chat!
Feeling nervous?|You have the skills for it.
Feeling sober, Chizuko began\ndrawing up plans for\nthe world...
Feels great to hear that we managed to have such an impact on someone we don't even know.
Feels like a secret base for a team of\nsuperheroes. Not bad.
Feels like it's been ages, but also like\nwe just met the other day.
Feels more like magic.|Feels more like sci-fi.
Feels pretty good.|We're too young to drink.
Female bartenders are sometimes\ncalled barmaids.
Fending off selfish desire with righteous\nindignation. You truly have awakened.
Fiber-optic cables keep the whole world connected!
Fiber-optic cables may connect us with people\naround the globe, but do you have any idea\nhow that was done?
Fifth period is in the lab. If we don't leave now, we're totally screwed.
Fight like you mean it! That's it! Keep it\ncoming!
Fight on!
Filthy trespassers...
Finally time to rest...
Finally, I've found\nthe treasure.
Finally, garnish with a lime and you're done!\nIt's about as classic a mocktail as they\ncome.
Finally, we must dress the part.
Finally, what was the fourth order?
Finally... Our Phantom Thief debut.
Find the others.|Let's search for that Core.
Finding a good book is like meeting a\nspecial new friend.
Finding them seems like it would be such an\nelegant pastime. Now then, what comes after\n6 and 28?
Fine by me then. You came all this way just for medicine after all.
Fine by me! It's your code name after all. If you know what you want to be called, all the better.
Fine by me. Hey, gimme my usual. Chop-chop.
Fine by me. Shall we exchange details as\nwell, Tomoko-chan?
Fine by me.|Today's kinda busy, actually.
Fine taste...?
Fine! Let's do it!
Fine, I said that. But Tamayo is definitely\nusing this time to get ahead of me!
Fine, I'll ask you when you're done...
Fine, maybe that happened, but still...!
Fine. Guess we ought to tell you everything.\nSo we might've come here by accident, but...
Fine. I know I didn't ask her feelings\noutright, but there's no way her love for\nbaseball has changed!
Fine. I'll leave for today.
Fine. Then how 'bout this? Let's decide by\nwho can hit the most home runs.
Fine...|But I need to prepare.
Finish it, and you'll earn a fabulous cash prize!
Finished up at the clinic.|We have the drugs.
Finishing that giant ramen's\ngoing to take careful\nconsideration and <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>.
Firing laser beams from the eyes... Is that\nactually a form of ninjutsu? It seems\ndisrespectful to call it so.
First and foremost, allow me to convey\nmy gratitude.
First let me say...
First let's take out the other Shadows!
First of all, Ms. Katayama was told\nnot to make contact with students\noutside of class.
First off, would you say you're doing well financially?
First period is about to start. Report to\nyour classrooms at once.
First things first. Thank you for joining\nour club, {NAME2}-kun.
First this... Connect that... Right then,\nlet's try turning it on.
First time I heard of it...
First time fishing here? Have fun!
First time taking my class? Or... not? Well, either way...
First up is a bouquet with big, bright blooms\nto congratulate a friend on the birth of\ntheir baby.
First up is the Neo-Featherman figure. Then\nmy souped-up PC and instant yakisoba...
First up is the heart of the challenger\nteam, Kiiiiing Robooo!
First we have this Chinese tea, aaand...
First we have to figure out\nhow to lift the <color=#FF423F>grate</color>\nat the end of the hall...
First we need to agree on changing the\nPalace ruler's heart by unanimous decision.
First we need to find three <color=#FF423F>balls</color>. We can use\nthose to stop the <color=#FF423F>blade mechanism</color>.
First we should head to the furthest edge of\nthe second area. Let's go, Wonder.
First, I'll start with the straining motion.\nHa, ha, ha! Haaah!
First, bake the batter. Then put in the\nstrawberries, the cream, and wrap it all up\nin the cr\xeape. Then it's finished.
First, calm down.|We have to find a way out.|Something's fishy about this.
First, dance in 1 turn and strike the\nshichi-go-san bell <color=#FF423F>3 times</color>.\nNo more and no less.

First, to adorn himself with the blood of\nhis enemies...
First-time visitor, yeah? What brings you in?
First...
Firstly, I believe the fact that Akashi and\nKatayama are connected in the real world is\na large part of it.
Firstly, in the Metaverse your clothing changes to reflect the will of your desires.
Firstly, the shadows will not anticipate\nus returning to the palace so soon after\nleaving.
Five beef croquettes, please.
Five... four... three... two...
Flab-ber-gas-ted! It means, to be surprised!
Flabber...what?|What did you say?
Flair bartending is also a type of\nperformance, so I found it really inspiring.
Flair bartending is the art of making drinks\nwhile performing like this.
Flattery can get you pretty far after all.\nBoth with customers and your boss.
Flee with as much caution as possible,\nwe musn't be found!
Flower symbolism truly is like another\nlanguage... Humans think of all sorts of\nthings! But how did they decide on these?
Focus and try to keep track of them all.
Focus on your thighs and glutes, and use\nthat energy to push yourself ahead!
Focus! Katayama is only getting stronger!\n<color=#FF423F>Defend</color> yourselves!
Follow me.
Follow me. I know another spot where we can\nrelax a bit.
Follow my instructions.
Follow my lead!
Following Closer's previous suggestion, I believe it should make the perfect target to test out our new weapons.
Following school rumors and my own research,\nI was finally able to confirm its location.
Following the procedure imparted to me...\nTwo to form one anew... Two to form one...
Following your desire is most important.
Food delivery.|I came to deliver your yakitori...
Food delivery.|Your yakitori has arrived.
Food fight...?
Food's getting cold.
Food, electricity, heating... No matter how\nI try to cut costs, it all keeps adding up.
Food... Yes! That's certainly an interesting\nidea.
Fools... Defeating my decoy only restores my\npower. Ignorance is a sin, isn't it?\nAhahaha!
For <color=#FF423F>ruin</color> awaits you.
For I am thou...
For Narumi and Merope's sake,\nwe need to change that rotten\nproducer's heart...
For Noge!|He's going to pay.
For Suzui-san's sake.
For Tomoko's sake, we can't afford to lose, so I figured I should do what I can to get stronger.
For a Shadow I'm not sensing much hostility\nfrom it. In fact, it's more like...
For a true lover of Shibuya such as yourself,\nthis should be a cinch!
For a while I thought it might be easier for\nme to play alone.
For a while, I had trouble knowing if I was\neven awake or not.
For a year now, our goal as a club has been\nto perform in a competition.
For access to the guide, please consult\nthe administrative staff.
For all we know, she could be searching for Kiuchi. If she finds him, she might be the one in danger.
For another, their misdeeds span from pranks\nto actual crimes and everything in between.
For con caf\xe9s, I believe that kind of extra\npay is largely at the discretion of the shop.
For delinquent children you've done well...\nHowever! You will go no further!
For example, acquiring an item that's up\nhigh can be quite the challenge.
For example, all of the bookshelves here\nappear to be missing volumes.
For example, in this game you become the\nhero and defeat the demon king.
For example, the adhesive bandages are on\nthis shelf next to the register.
For example, water's pretty dangerous. People drown in rivers and oceans all the time.
For example, what do you think yellow casa\nblanca lilies represent?
For example... hacking open a locked door.
For instance, the Pythagorean theorem in\nmath. It was discovered by the ancient Greek\nPythagoras.
For me, it's Koshien Stadium and the sizzling\ndrama between Japan's top teen baseball\nstars at nationals!
For now I'll take as many chamomiles as you\nhave. Then I'll try filling out the bouquet\nat other shops.
For now all we can do is return to the real\nworld and try to get ahold of Shun Kano.
For now, let's have faith in her and simply\ndo what we can.
For now, try using it on the door from earlier.
For now, you should run!
For now, you'd best return to your own world.
For once in my life, things were going well for me... and I saw a new reason to live.
For one thing, there are just too many\nMenaces reported on Divine Judgment.
For people for want yakitori but are too far\naway, we could deliver them real yakitori...
For real! We owe it all to her!
For real!?
For real!? But... There aren't any Shadows\nhere. Maybe it's best to give it a rest\nfor now.
For real!? Then let's smash it up already!
For real. It's like you bring us together as\na unit. I finally feel like things're gonna\nbe okay now!
For real?
For real? I guess we'll be having lunch with\nyou in the Student Guidance Office,\nMr. Akashi!
For reasons unknown, Cores feel akin to\nTreasures; thus I can sense them as well.
For reference, it's about 18 miles from Tokyo\nto Yokohama. So two countries really are\nneighbors.
For so long... I agonized over what happened at that baseball clinic.
For some reason, I feel my\nresolve to get past\nthem fading...
For some reason, I woke up\nin a cold sweat...
For some reason, I'm getting\na bad feeling about this...
For some reason,\nI'm starting to feel like this\nlook isn't all that bad.
For sure. Money's good to have, but only a\nscumbag goes around tricking others to\nget it.
For sure.|I saw a light...
For that reason, I hope you'll allow me to\nentertain you today.
For that reason, I hope you'll allow me to\ninvite you to a photoshoot today.
For that reason, the police refuse to take\naction. Simply claiming it was an "accident"\nis enough for them to drop the issue.
For the sake of my future, perhaps I should\ninteract with my classmates more often.
For the sake of the interview, we could\nphrase it as, "What sort of changes have you\nexperienced recently?"
For the sake of your future? That's not\nquite why you should do it.
For the sake of your personal growth, we must\nsample them all.
For the time being, it's best we play\nalong. I'm counting on you, Wonder.
For this achievement...
For this trial can only be surmounted by the\ndemonic art of the <color=#FF423F>Cursed Eye of Time</color>!
For this, your unyielding desire must be\ncommended.
For what reason do people make and\nwatch them?
For what?|What are you up to?|I heard an explosion.
For you humans to recover what's been taken\nfrom you, we must steal it back.
For you to be here now of all times... That\nmeans you've come to see me, yes?
For you to grasp my emotions so easily\ntells me that I've still got ways to go as a\nbartender.
Force our way through.|We can take them.
Forcibly remolding another human's mind is\nnot an act that should be taken lightly.
Forget about me. You two run.
Forget about that, catch them!
Forget about that. Right now Kano-kun needs\nus to protect him.
Forget all that, everyone's here now!
Forget it. Like I said, it's pure\nspeculation. I shouldn't be sharing\nunverified information with you.
Forget it. They're never gonna listen to us.\nLet's just go home.
Forget my words and take some time now to think it over for yourself.
Forgive me,
Forgive me. I am aware that to make other\nfans wait is a breach of etiquette.
Forgive me. It isn't what you think...
Forgive me. There are still many mysteries\nin this world... and perhaps some distortions\nas well.
Forgive me. There's much I want to learn\nabout you humans. It seems smartphones are\nvery convenient sources of information.
Forgive my audacity, but please adjust the\nangle of your feet.
Fortunately the entrance to Shibuya Station\nis nearby. Let's exit Mementos from here.
Fortunately, with the police issue\neliminated, we've freed up time to make the\nproper arrangements.
Foul!
Found some interesting article, have you?
Four shinobi? Does that mean... us?
Fox, let's do this!
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a hoot.

From recollection, wasn't your quasi-cat able\nto sense Cores as well?
From that day on I decided to become a\nkeyboardist.
From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts!
From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
From the look on your face, I guess you're\nwondering why I don't go.
From the owner's perspective,\nit's instant profit...
From the pitch Arai hit?
From the smell, I'm guessin' you still can't get the shavings quite right, is that it?
From the voices of humanity responding to his name, I can sense the Palace just ahead.
From this day, you are my retainer, ho!\nServe me-hee well, ho!
From this height? Well, I can probably manage\nthat, but what do we do if the elevator\nsuddenly starts movin' again?
From this point, several paths lie ahead...
From today on, I'll be working to identify\nproblems like unnecessary work and\neliminating them.
From what I am able to recall, there are\n<color=#FF423F>seven</color> Treasures in total. Which would mean...
From what I hear, it's somethin' folks\ncall "branding."
From what I heard, it was like he was a\ndifferent person and took full\naccountability.
From what I know, he's pretty infamous in the\ndance scene. You might even find blog posts\nfrom his other victims.
From what they're saying,\nMinami's not actually these\nkids' big sister...

Future plans...
Fwahaha! Inspiration hits! My muse...
Fwahaha! It's coming along! And rather\nswimmingly at that! Wooo!
Gaaah! Easy for you to say when you're\nnot the ones running!
Gaaah! Will you hear me out, {NAME2}?
Gaagh!
Gah!
Gah! H-How did you find me? Is my star power\njust that bright...?
Gah! Um! It's time for announcements!\nI'm just gonna make them, and then we're done\nhere, okay?
Gah, curse my lack of artistic sense! Is that\nreally all I'm worth?
Gah, this really is tough... What should\nI do?
Gahaha! All eyes on me!
Gahaha! You better give me what I want!
Gaining something many covet can leave a\ntarget on your back.
Game over!
Game reenactment inaccurate.\nYou have failed.
Gardening, huh? What are you growing?
Gather 'round, gather 'round! It's time for\nI, Yui, to answer all your questions!
Gaze upon the radiant light and somber\ndarkness within me!
Gazing at a dazzling screen in a dim room is\nmuch like a ritual.
Geez, stop fighting and focus on the actual\nenemy! If it gets back up, just knock it down\nagain!
Gentileschi was unfairly tried in court and\nreleased a work based on her\nown experience...
Get a grip!

Get a part-time job, then. It's not against\nschool rules or anything.
Get home safe!

Get it right, and you'll win a special prize\nfrom me, Shichi-kun!
Get out of here how?|Who found us?

Give me that phone! Delete the video!
Give me time, leader. I promise I'll find\na way to save Ms. Katayama!
Given that the fake feline does not benefit\nfrom wealth, it appears he would rather\ndirect it toward his... other ambitions.
Given the regional diversity, it's no\nsurprise that there're infinite ways of\npairing teas and sweets together.
Given your confidence, we can make finding\nthe Core our primary objective. Now, where\nis it...
Given your responsibilities as a student, I\nwould be remiss to inhibit your desire\nto learn...
Giving up so soon!?
Glad I could help.|I haven't done anything.|I know you'll find your confidence.
Glad I was able to get it back to her.
Glad I'm not the only one getting nervous...\nOkay, I'll count from five.
Glad to be part of the team, fellow Phantom Thieves. Let's give it our all!
Glad to have you here again!
Glad to hear it! But let me know if you got\nhurt, okay?
Glad to hear it! Let's head straight to the\nfield, then!
Glad to hear it, but I need to improve\nquickly so that I can teach others.
Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! Can't be\nmuch of a merchant without satisfied\ncustomers, now, can I!?
Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it. Oh, almost forgot! I always\npost on social media when I finish a run.
Glad to hear it.|Hopefully it stays that way.|So no one's gonna lock us up again?
Glad you're having fun.|What about the wrath of god?
Glad you're here. These are pretty filling.\nDon't think I could finish 'em both on\nmy own.
Gladly.|If I must.
Glasses are better.|Contacts, of course.
Gloom?|Things do feel off.
Go ahead and choose whichever one you like!
Go ahead, I'd like to see you try!
Go ahead, bully me. C'mon, do it!
Go ahead. Choose whatever.
Go ahead.|I'm sure she'll understand.

Go on, Yaoling-san. Give the tea a try.
Go on, answer me!

Goddamn it. Women really are useless!
Going for a run under the sun just feels\nbetter, you know?
Going here would not serve you well at this\ntime, I must say.
Going through the ducts is a very phantom\nthief-like method. Since I've made it\nthis far, allow me to go first.
Gold Medal...
Gold gerbera.|White lily of the valley.|Red tulips.
Gone are the days of being a mere fledgling.

Good evening. Don't you think you're a bit\nyoung to be out at this time of night?
Good evening.|You did great.
Good eye! That's an egg white omelette.
Good faith and fair dealing also extends to\nthird parties too.
Good for you.
Good for you.|I'm excited too.
Good gracious. The ninja brutally murdered\nalmost everyone that crossed his path,\nall to reclaim his master's gold...
Good grief.
Good grief. Seems our team of Phantom Thieves certainly won't be lacking in energy.
Good grief... Took you long enough.
Good heavens! Did you see all the chili in\nthat ramen!? The soup was bright red...!
Good heavens... I can hardly believe I am on\nthe same team as that wretched cat.
Good idea! We can make it a welcome party for Yusuke, too!
Good idea. I ought to get that for dinner...
Good idea. If you got hurt in all the\nexcitement, I'd never forgive myself.
Good idea. Let's head to the station once our preparations are in order.
Good idea... It's not very common to find\nyourself overwhelmed with flowers.
Good idea.|Let's do that.
Good idea.|Let's hurry.
Good idea.|You gonna fly on over there?
Good job today! What'd you think?
Good job, {NAME1}. How are you holding up?
Good job, {NAME2}-kun. That was so fun!
Good job. Let's stop here for today.

Good morning, {NAME1}-kun.
Good morning.
Good morning...|What are you doing here?
Good morning.|Are you feeling okay?
Good morning.|You look sleepy.
Good morning? Hello? Good evening?\nI can never tell what time it is here...
Good night.
Good point, you're exactly right. It doesn't\nhave that magnificent, fascinating quality\nthat I'm after.
Good point. It is a lot of food... You did\nsay you were hungry, though!
Good point. Maybe I'm just pickier than\nmost...
Good point. There's no point in rushing if I\nget a bad review anyway.
Good point... So, Soy, can you think of a\nnumber that might fit the bill?
Good posture is important.\nI'll keep it in mind.
Good question... I know it sounds strange for\nme to say it, but I'm a bit of a contrarian.
Good question... Seems like she's\nhaving trouble focusing.
Good stuff! I'd better add another hundred\npush-ups to my set to keep up with you, man!
Good thinking. A store employee wouldn't be\nallowed to be that rude to us...
Good timing?|Did something happen?
Good to hear.
Good to hear. I'm so glad you're interested.
Good to hear. Lots of stuff to lift and move\naround at this job, so don't push yourself,\nokay?
Good to hear.|Get what?

Good to see you!
Good to see you, {NAME2}.
Good to see you.
Good with customers and well-read to boot!\nYou've been a great help today.

Good work! That's it for today.
Good work! You're free to go now.
Good work, Wonder!
Good work, Wonder. Keep it up.
Good work, Wonder. Now we can investigate\nthis area.
Good work, keep up that pace! Let's go!
Good work, {NAME2}-kun.\nHow's it going on bass?
Good work. I'll handle it from here.
Good! Not bad at all!
Good, I agree. In that case...
Good, I see you know your stuff.
Good, it seems we can proceed now!
Good, let's give this a try!
Good, let's make haste.
Good, one key obtained!
Good, the grate blocking the door is open.
Good, try to commit all the details to\nmemory. Particularly the items most frequently\nrequested by customers.
Good, we've removed that Shadow's protection\nfrom the lord shadow.
Good, you're all here.
Good. I'll bat first!
Good. I'm sick of fighting a phony.
Good. Let's get back to that first painting.
Good. Now get running!
Good. Once you get the treasure,\nlet's return to the bank entrance.
Goodbye then.
Goodbye.
Goodness, how exhausting.
Goooo team!
Goooood morning, Wonder!
Gosh, when is the last time I went to the\nYongen <color=#FF423F>batting cages</color>?
Got a minute?
Got a new item on sale?|Sorry, we don't have the funds.
Got all that?
Got an idea of how to play now?
Got it!
Got it! Gimme a shout next time you're free!
Got it! Let's go, you bastards!
Got it! So... Who's your favorite,\nMerope-chan?
Got it! {NAME1}-kun, then.
Got it!|Let your fury fly!
Got it, I'll make sure to have some\non hand next time I make you coffee.
Got it, leave it to me!
Got it.
Got it. Lemme know if you feel like it\nanother time!
Got it. Let's look around for them.
Got it. So... Who is your favorite?
Got it.|Let's find them.
Got it.|Sounds easy enough.
Got to give my full support\nfrom the kitchen...!
Gotcha. Let's go another time.
Gotcha. No wonder we couldn't find them\nhere. Turns out they were in an entirely\ndifferent Palace.
Gotcha. Oh well. Let's do it another\nday then.
Gotcha. We should make sure we're prepared.\nJust try your best to hurry!
Gotcha.\nBe careful, Senpai.
Gotta admit, I'm kinda nervous.
Gotta be a publicity stunt. It's all\nscripted, y'know? He'll just tear the guy\nto shreds in the end.
Gotta deliver this coffee while it's still\nice-cold, or the customer's gonna complain!
Gotta deliver this coffee while it's still\npiping hot, or the customer's gonna complain!
Gotta fight... Gotta fight! But I'm\njust so scared!
Gotta go find the key!
Gotta keep my head cool, and my drive fierce...*exhale* I'm cool.
Gotta run, gotta run!
Go|Don't
Grab the Treasure and run!
Grandma's always been there for me so this is\nmy way of saying thanks.
Grasping the relationships of the countries\non the map makes it a bit easier to\nunderstand historical events.
Great analysis.|Is it ramen time yet?|Want more monjayaki?
Great choice! Unlike powder, you can carry\nit around and drink it anywhere.
Great choice! You really wanna grow those\nmuscles big and beautiful, huh?
Great for times like this!
Great idea! That being said, I'll have to\nnegotiate with the school board first.
Great idea! You're right, it'd be more fun if\nall three of us played together!
Great job as always! Here's your pay.
Great job the other day! You were\nreally hustling.
Great job today!
Great job today! You nailed it.

Great work today. Here, this is what I\nowe you.
Great work today. Thanks for coming in again!
Great work!
Great work! We finished everything\nI had planned for rehearsal today,\nso let's wrap up.
Great work! You some kind of robot? No one's\never been that good on their first day.
Great work. Let's wrap up for today.\nThat was kind of tiring.
Great!
Great! Actually, talking to you made me want\nto try running in Shimo-Kitazawa again.
Great! All right, let's get going.
Great! I just knew you'd say yes!
Great! I was so worried you'd say no!
Great! I'd expect nothing less from my\nfriend! Your ear muscles are\ngetting stronger!

Great! You found them! I'll get this fixed\nin a jiffy!
Great!\nLet's head to the Palace right now!
Great, a sales tactic...|This feels sketchy...
Great, let's give this a shot...
Great, one order of Fave Omelette Rice.
Great, thank you so much!
Great, thanks a lot!
Great, that might work. I could make you\na non-alcoholic cocktail, or a "mocktail"\nin other words.
Great, you're here too now?
Great. Glad you liked it.
Great. I'll let everybody know!
Great. I'm certain I've captured some\namazing images here today.
Great. Let's walk and talk.
Great. Oh, and Arai, we're the same age and\nall, so you can drop the "-kun."
Great. Our next goal is to play in the tournament and get through the first round!
Great... All the exits are blocked off. This\ntime it's electricity instead of infrared\nlasers.
Great... You'll need to get your bass\nfirst, though.
Greater accomplishments await you. Let us\ncontinue another time.
Green.|Orange.|Brown.
Greetings.
Greetings. I am a mind-controlled robot.
Grilled frankfurters! You're quite the\ngourmand, aren't you, Cattle!
Gross! Oh my god, he is the worst!
Gross, there's a video? Damn, that's graphic...
Grovel before me like the worthless trash\nyou are, scum!
Grow, grow, potatoes! Grow, grow!
Grrr...

Grrrrr...
Grumpy bastard...
Guess I have to get changed...
Guess I have to spin around...
Guess I just block it out with booze...
Guess I should head to school.
Guess I'll check out a few job huntin' apps...
Guess I'll just practice in my head for now.\n'Kay, time to get in the zone.
Guess I'm<color=#FF423F>Cu Chulainn</color> now...
Guess it wasn't just his good looks that\nshined, but the coins in his purse too...\nJust kidding!
Guess it wasn't really for me.
Guess it'd be kinda tough to head there,\nhuh...?
Guess it's up to me.
Guess my artist's eye finally paid off.
Guess that makes it clear what we gotta do,\nthen. Let's team up to find our friends.
Guess that means no lunch\nfor me...
Guess that means we're in the same grade!
Guess that's settled, then! I'll head over\nthat way now too.
Guess they're feeling cautious. They might even be guarding something.
Guess we can't brute force it. I don't see\nanything around that'll move it, either...
Guess we just have to do it.|It'll be a long road ahead.
Guess we really have to do it.
Guess we were wrong, huh?
Guess we'll have to look somewhere else.
Guess we'll need some energy to open\nthis one, too.
Guess we're gonna have to fight!
Guess we've still got a long road ahead of\nus... Well, no use complaining. Let's keep\nmoving!
Guess what? A friend recommended me\na biopic on a man named Rob Roy. His display\nof altruism was truly amazing.
Guess what? I made\nlunch today!
Guess what? Shichi-kun's a great dancer!\nI hope you've got your phone ready,\nbecause I'm about to bust a move!
Guitar and bass go well together of course,\nbut it's also just... really fun to play\nwith you.
Gyaaah! Th-The data from our last\nexperiment... It's gone!?
Gyah...! This... wasn't in... my\nscreenplay...
H-H-How the heck did I get here? I was just at Shibuya Station a second ago.
H-Haha... Sorry, Rina-chan. I'm just a\nbartender.
H-Have a nice day.
H-He's right... I ruined the lives of\neveryone around me...
H-Here... we... GO!
H-Hey!
H-Hey! Who're you calling... Oh, I suppose\nyou have a point.
H-Hey, are you guys all right!?
H-Hey, that's...!
H-Hold on a sec... I feel like all my energy is...
H-Hold on a second!
H-Hold on! Are we really going in there,\nRiko-senpai!?
H-Hold on! You're not planning on putting\nme in there, are you?
H-Hoo!?
H-Hoo!? Me?
H-How about it? Wait, I'll even throw in the\nrecipes for you so you can make them at home!
H-Huh?
H-hoo!? Get your hands off me! I'm not a\nspecial giveaway!
Ha! Nothing but a pair of amateurs...
Ha! You can say that again!
Ha! You truly are pathetic.
Ha, even our fearless leader's exhausted,\nhuh?
Ha-yah!
Haaaaa!
Haaaayah!
Haaah!
Haaah, finally done.
Haaah... I think hangin' around with you\nguys has really increased my stamina...
Hacking may be useful in the Metaverse,\nbut it's a crime in reality.
Had trouble speaking?|Did you argue with the judges?
Hah! "Real" this, "pride" that. Geez, you and\nYamagoshi-san with your doe-eyed delusions\nabout "the soul of Victory Kitchen."
Hah! All right, fine.
Hah! It's not too late yet. Time is on our\nside, after all.
Hah! There you go again, ooon and ooon about\n"hopes" and "dreams" and "rainbows"! The\nonly ones buying that fairytale nonsense...
Hah! You're always so funny,\n{NAME2}-chan!
Hah! You've got a lot of catchin' up to do.\nYou think the royal family was out smuggling?
Hah!?
Hah, nice try. The real answer is linking.\nSometimes the simplest answer is correct.
Hah, not a thought in your head today, huh?\nAs a matter of fact, it is possible.
Hah, not even close. Just guessing?\nThe answer is exercise to train the body\nand mind.
Hah, thank you for proving that you weren't\npaying attention! The correct answer was\nMrs. Marie Curie.
Hah, you're quite the foodie, aren't you,\nSensei? No wonder we get along.
Hah. Only Miyazawa'd be satisfied playing\ndress-up as king of a made-up castle.
Hah. You're a pretty funny guy.
Hah? Are you covering this up\nbecause we caught you on camera?\nYou really are a Menace!
Haha!
Haha! Don't you get it? Everyone sacrificed\nthings they cared about to protect you.\nThere's no way they'd forgive you!
Haha! I guess even you make jokes every now\nand then, {NAME2}-kun.
Haha! I'm sure we'll find a way to meet\nagain.
Haha! It seems the orange tabby was right\nabout you after all.
Haha! Kano-kun's not fazed a bit!
Haha! Still, though. Now that there's this\nconnection between us... I'm sure we'll\nmeet again.
Haha! That's the best compliment a bartender\ncan get.
Haha! Where'd that come from? You're always\nso funny, Merope!
Haha! You're fun. {NAME1}-kun always\nkeeps good company, I guess!
Haha, I don't know about that. There are\nloads of better bartenders out there.
Haha, I feel so bad making you come here.\nSending you on a scavenger hunt to find me...
Haha, I told ya so, Shun! Great work!
Haha, age is still takin' a number on me,\nbut that won't stop me from comin' here all\nthe time.
Haha, glad someone's got a sense of humor.
Haha, harsh words! But as long as I could be\nof help, that's all that matters.
Haha, it's no problem at all. Ya have the\nplace to yourselves today.
Haha, just like you right now.
Haha, relax, Shun. Young people these days are always exchangin' beeper numbers and all that, right?
Haha, right!? That's Pops's patented flavor.
Haha, right? Even if you're just mixing\ningredients, nailing the proportions can be\ntough!
Haha, sorry. I went a bit too far, huh.
Haha, sure thing. Nobody out there's a match\nfor you, {NAME2}.
Haha, sure...
Haha, thank you. But it's still not as good\nas Pops's.
Haha, thanks.
Haha, that's true!
Haha, the heck does that mean? Just tell me!
Haha, think you have room for seconds? I was\njust about to start cooking my ramen.
Haha, well, we've all gotta start somewhere,\nright? Don't worry! As captain, I'll support\nyou every step of the way!
Haha, what on earth's gotten into you?
Haha. Ah... I see. I mean this isn't a great example, but...
Haha. But for real, don't go too hard on him\nthis time guys, all right?
Haha. By the way, {NAME2}-kun, is it\nreally okay to give roast pork to an owl?
Haha. Feels like we're taking things seriously for the first time in forever!
Haha. I can't hide anything from you,\nMerope-chan.
Haha. Sure, whatever you say. So what were you talking about?
Haha. Thank you, Merope-chan.
Haha. Thanks!
Haha. Well, then you must have some favorite\nRangers or Riders from your childhood!
Haha... Come on, it's rude not to say hello,\nyou know?
Haha... Do you honestly think people love\nyou for you?
Haha... Guess we know what Lufel's favorite is.
Haha... Nice work, Coach. I never would've\nrealized without your help, {NAME2}.
Haha... Nothing gets past you.
Haha... Thank you.
Haha... That happened last time...
Haha... You must be surprised.
Hahah, I see you have a lot of respect for him!
Hahah, don't think in extremes, kid.\nIn reality, it'd be split between you\nand the landowner.
Hahah, that rope is made with reinforced\nthread. A trifling hack and slash isn't\ngoing to cut it.
Hahah. But Menaces are at the center of public attention right now, so it certainly isn't hurting your influence.
Hahaha! A stiff drink can cure anythin'! But\nyou won't be able to taste the food with\na cold!
Hahaha! I prefer to let others handle my\ndirty work.
Hahaha! So you ignore 'em as soon as they\nsign, huh!? You really are perfect for our\nsales team! Keep up the good work!
Hahaha! What's a plot of land ever done to\ndeserve your rage?
Hahaha! You're funny.
Hahaha! You're very welcome.
Hahaha, I had a feelin' you wouldn't be\njoinin'. Welp, we're all done here then.\nGood pump today!
Hahaha, I think Senpai's car seats got yours\nbeat in the luxury department, Lufel.
Hahaha, I told you, didn't I?\nTanemura-kun does outstanding work!
Hahaha, I'm sorry I could only help you\nover the phone this time.
Hahaha, lemme show you around!
Hahaha, okay! I'll bring them right out\nfor you.
Hahaha, this really is a soap opera!
Hahaha, you seem like a hard worker! I'm\nsure I can count on you for all sorts\nof things.
Hahaha, you're so funny! Might as well exchange info.
Hahaha, you're that confident, huh? I'm\nlooking forward to it even more now.
Hahaha, you've got me there.
Hahaha.
Hahaha. I see you're in a good mood today. Something good happen?
Hahaha. Okay, okay. Since we're a team from\nhere on out, let's be the kind of teammates\nthat can tell each other anything.
Hahaha. Saying this all out loud really is\nembarrassing, huh!
Hahaha. She says she appreciates you taking\ncare of the orange tabby for her.
Hahaha. The kids really like you, huh!
Hahaha...
Hahaha... I see you still have that thing\nfor muscles...
Hahaha... It makes us sound so cool when you say it like that...
Hahaha... See? Drinking too much is\ndangerous.
Hahaha... Sorry, we're kinda in a hurry so...
Hahaha... Well you see, I haven't had many\nchances to talk to women in my lifetime.
Hahahah. Now you're finished!
Hahahaha!
Hahahaha! Even those pecs of yours can barely\ncontain their excitement!
Hahahaha! I haven't met muscles this\nmotivated in ages!
Hahahaha! It looks like you could hear\nthem, too!
Hahahaha! Looks like I'm gonna go meet up\nwith a lady by the station.
Hahahaha! This must be fate then. You're like an\nopen squat rack after 5 PM!
Hahahaha! You underestimate me, friend.\nDon't you worry!
Hahahahaha. You thought you could corner me? Well look who's cornered now!
Ham-fisted!?
Hand it over, Hiromu Miyazawa. All the hope\nyou've stolen. Now!
Hand over your phone too.
Hang on a sec! You... You look like someone\nwho knows a thing or two about Divine\nJudgment.
Hang on a sec... Where are we? How did we\nsuddenly end up here?
Hang on, I can't imagine the teacher we know\nnow as a delinquent!
Hang on, let's back up a sec. We haven't\neven explained the situation to\n{NAME2} yet!
Hang on, that's like a serious crime. Shouldn't someone report it to the police?
Hang on, we may be able to return to the\nprevious hall via the air vents.
Hang on, you made this!? Not someone from the restaurant!?
Hang on. This is the right room, but...
Hang on...
Hang on... "Heritage Kitchen." I feel like I've heard that name before.
Hang on... is it okay for owls to eat eggs and stuff?
Happy to be here.|Leave everything to me.
Happy to have you aboard! Let's aim for the national stadium together!
Happy to have you, {NAME2}-kun.\nWe're short a bassist...
Happy...
Harajuku! It feels like it's been forever...\nI want to say I was here all the time as\na kid.
Hard to say... but that would mean this is\nMs. Katayama's Palace, then.
Hard to scratch doesn't mean hard to break...\nSounds like the human spirit, if you ask me.
Hard work will always bear fruit...\nThat's right! A massive fruit we call gains!
Harder! Faster! Show me what you can do!
Harness Phantom Idols, their Persona Duos,\nand everything else at your disposal...
Haruna Nishimori-san, and\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san. All right, got it.
Haruna and I brainstormed\npuzzle ideas for Shota.
Haruna and I discussed what\ngoing to school in the States\nwould be like...
Haruna and I discussed what\nthe Explorer Club would do...
Haruna and Shota both really\nmiss having fun together...
Haruna and her friends left...
Haruna misses you.|What do you want to tell her?
Haruna must be\nincredibly smart...
Haruna proceeded to tell me\nmore tales of Buchiko...
Haruna really thinks I can solve all these?
Haruna started writing on\na large sheet of paper...
Haruna took me on a deep dive\ninto Shichi-kun lore...
Haruna!
Haruna!?
Haruna's eyes are bright\nwith wonder. It's like she's\ndying to know.
Haruna's friend, {NAME2}-san. He was\nwith everybody in Shibuya.
Haruna's really good at making this kind of\npuzzle, huh?
Haruna, did something happen with Shota?\nI just saw him run out of the building.
Haruna, don't make too much trouble for\nhim, okay?
Haruna, let's head to the diner. Let's not\nkeep Yuna-chan and Kyo-kun waiting.
Haruna-chan would figure things out so fast.\nYou were always frantic to keep up!
Haruna-chan, the next question's over here!
Haruna... I'm really sorry about this.
Haruna? As in Haruna Nishimori?
Haste makes waste.|We can't be reckless.
Hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE!
Hate... Hate...
Hate... Hate... Hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE!
Hatred and violence are the best,\ndon't you think? Wear my mask and\nlet's kick it on over to hell!
Have I?
Have a flyer! We're running a concept caf\xe9!
Have a good shift, Tomoko-chan! I'll be\ncheering you on!
Have a great day!
Have a nice day, sweety!
Have any new restaurants opened up? Maybe we\nshould see what's in the area.
Have faith in us.|Trust us.
Have no fear. I will be the force that leads\nto your awakening...
Have the car ready downstairs.
Have they started a day care here?
Have we met somewhere before?
Have you been a bad boy? Let's play!
Have you been going around with him to\ncheck out the flavors of foods at other\nrestaurants?
Have you been keeping on top of your\nhousehold chores? When you're alone, it's\neasy to neglect them, right?
Have you been to the drugstore in Shibuya?\nThat's where we'll be working today!
Have you decided to tread the path of strife...?
Have you ever considered that you yourself\nresemble an idol?
Have you ever heard of water intoxication?\nOur bodies need it, but too much\nis dangerous for you.
Have you ever played bass before,\n{NAME2}-kun?
Have you ever randomly got a huge craving\nto eat a certain food?
Have you every felt that way too? Hehe.
Have you finally come to your senses?
Have you finished warming up?
Have you found your resolve?|Show him what a real chef is!
Have you heard about the school's seven mysteries?
Have you heard the name "Ice Queen" before?\nThat's what people started calling her.
Have you heard?\nAnother new Menace appeared.
Have you met everyone in our group,\n{NAME2}? I feel like there's\na connection between us Persona-users.
Have you seen the new episode yet?
Have you thought about making videos? I hear\nyou can make money even if you just\npost random stuff.
Have you tried the limited-time special? The\nHeaping Hot 'N' Spicy Spaghetti!?
Have you tried this new app out yet?\nIt's incredible!
Having another musician here has kinda\nhelped me relax, I guess?
Having finally settled on\na shop, Yaoling and I drank\nsome tea before heading home.
Having friends by your side will give you\nstrength... Today would be a good day to\nnurture your bonds.
Having passed the first trial, the shinobi\nwere faced with a second trial!
Having so many members quit was a bummer. But we can't mope about it forever!
Having some tea!
Having students handle such sensitive\ndocuments is also an issue.
Having that which you desire rejected, hoom?\nA scenario that gives much food for thought,\nto be sure.
He also feels indebted to me.
He always provides me with the finest milk,\nafter all!
He always wants to eat the same thing every day until he gets sick of it.
He always worried we'd never get the chance\nto debut in a competition when there were\nonly three of us.
He and Haruna-chan were the only ones who\nnoticed the problem with the puzzle!
He apparently has a habit of hiding\n"treasures" around his territory.
He asked for sushi? Sorry about that,\nI'll talk to him...
He asked someone to call the cops on him?
He asked you to be partners, right? Kinda unexpected based on the vibe he gave off yesterday.
He buys cattle to help starving people, only\nfor an evil aristocrat to swindle him, kill\nhis friend and kidnap his wife.
He came in claimin' to be some famous\ngourmet so-and-so, and started spouting BS\ncriticism against our soup.
He can face any challenge with nothing but\nhis lone blade. It'd be nice to have him on\nthe Phantom Thieves, hm?
He can't help that the school he's trying to\nget into has really high standards, right?
He can.|No, he can't.
He changed back...?
He changed his form to safeguard the\nCore. I'd say it's time to go all out!
He changed the room into a giant safe that quickly!?
He commits fraud and extortion, right?
He contacted the owner about it. I was too\nscared to be there, though.
He did say something about making learning\neasier at the assembly.

Heh, gotcha!
Heh, heh, heh. One more casualty for the\ncause! Ahhh, I really want some!

Hehe, the pleasure is mine. You two must be\nquite close to work jobs together like this.
Hehe, the umeboshi is the star of the show,\nso I doubt you will see all that much of me.

Hehe, well, it was nice to get some\nreal exercise in.

Hehe.
Hehe. All right Closer, my fellow gardener.\nLet me know if you grow anything delicious.

Hehe. If I have to do that first, performing\nshould feel like a breeze.
Hehe. The brass band said the same thing. And\nthey want a picture together.
Hehe. This is a super-fancy craft tea I\nbought. I hoped we could try it together,\nSensei!
Hehe. We went to painstaking effort to make\nthis colossal bowl of ramen a reality...
Hehe. Well as they say, you gotta milk it for all it's worth.
Hehe. You're a terrible liar. I'm sure I've\nseen you before in the second-year's\nhallway.
Hehe...
Hehe... Hahaha! That was a pretty poor cheer.
Hehe... If you talk like that, I'll never\nstop relying on you, you know?
Hehe... It's a good thing I asked you.
Hehe... Praise feels pretty good!
Hehe... Sensei, know any cool places we could\ngo? I'll leave it up to you!
Hehe... Yeah, you're right.
Heheh, I bet that got your gears\nturning. All right, I'll ask you,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Heheh, I can see that confused you a bit, but\nit's true. That's the name of that component.
Heheh, I must agree with your concierge Merope.
Heheh, it appears that you would like my\nassistance with something.
Heheh, it is pretty awful, but hey, better\nthan being tied up and hurt, I guess?
Heheh, only kidding... Oh, but this might\nmake for a good question for the class.
Heheh, so while we may think we know what\nwe're talking about, people in the future\nmay laugh at us.
Heheh, the logic of the animal kingdom is\nsomething else. Still, it gets a bit spooky\nfrom time to time.
Heheh, you've really turned your attitude\naround, huh?
Heheh. Just as I thought.
Heheh. Perhaps you ought to ask her yourself.
Heheh. So if anything, you're more like our guardian angel.
Heheh. That lies in your own hands.
Heheh. We shall call this ability of yours\nthe power of the <color=#FF423F>wild card</color>.
Heheh. You're dealing with a phantom thief\nhere. Of course I'm gonna steal the\nspotlight!

Hehehe!
Hehehe, no need to be so humble. Please,\naccept my thanks.
Hehehe, shopping with someone else is so fun!
Hehehe.
Hehehe. I should try to use the slang you\ntaught me next time.
Hehehe... Guess I can't sit on my laurels.\nI'll have to keep working on my skills too!
Hehehe... I suppose I do. I'll pay you back\nfor sure, just you wait!
Heheheh, fan or idol, I'll milk 'em all dry!

Heheheh, it's like you're a whole different person. Let's go!
Heheheh. You have shown new potential once again.

Henry Cavendish was famously antisocial.
Her ability to tolerate such unreasonable\ndemands and still keep a smile is\ncommendable.
Her beauty had something to do with it,\nof course, but...

Her passion to protect both fruit\nand veggies alike was stronger than\nthe hottest flames.
Her performance has an irresistible charm.
Her power is intensifying! She must be\nplanning something!
Her precision is getting\nworse, but...
Her previous band inviting her\nto rejoin must be what's\nbothering her...
Her skills of negotiation are truly something\nto aspire to.

Her supervisor.|Her friend.|Her boyfriend.
Her tenacity is quite fearsome. She's\ndetermined not to let anyone\ndefeat her.
Her time is way up! Send her packin'!
Her tone is so clear... Nobody\nat band club could hold a\ncandle to her!
Her twisted desires are running wild! If we\nlet our guard down, we're done for!
Her wings... Are those eyes?

Here we are. This caf\xe9 was once a traditional\nJapanese house! This floor and transom are\nprime examples of Japanese architecture.
Here we have Mesopotamian, Indus Valley, Nile\nValley and Yellow River civilizations. Try to\nassociate them with their topography.
Here ya go. Hope I didn't keep ya waitin'\ntoo long.
Here you are. I think you know how this goes.

Heritage Kitchen is my master's shop.
Heritage Kitchen?|Heritage Kitchen, duh.
Hero...?
Heroes that fight together as a team of\nrangers, or ones that bash heads solo?
Hey Minami-chan, when will my mom be back?
Hey Nishimori, can't we change our group\nname to something less kiddie-sounding\nalready?
Hey guys! Welcome to another taste testing\nvideo!
Hey guys!\nWe're here with a taste testing video!
Hey guys, we've been using Riko-senpai's\nreal name here, but...
Hey hey hey! I'm in the middle of my lines!\nNo talking on set!
Hey hey hey... Hey hey hey!
Hey hey! What's going on? We're in the\nmiddle of shooting!
Hey kiddos, you head back inside for a bit. The grown-ups have to talk now!
Hey man, thanks! You saved our butts\nthere. I'm Ryuji Sakam\u2014
Hey now! First you eavesdrop, now you're\ntellin' us to help you without givin' a\nreason?
Hey now, you can't have a secret meetin' right in front of my face, y'know.
Hey now, you haven't reached <color=#FF423F>50</color> yet. Don't\ngive up, though!
Hey there {NAME2}-kun.
Hey there! Where've you been?
Hey there! You're lookin' fit today!
Hey there, Gen! How're you doin'? You don't\nlook so hot.
Hey there, buddy!
Hey there, friend!
Hey there, friend. Good to see you again.
Hey there, my friend!
Hey there, pal! How's it goin'?
Hey there, sport. What's up? Ya hungry?
Hey there, {NAME2}! Oh, did I sound too\nexcited there? Hmm...
Hey there, {NAME2}!\nHankerin' for some yakitori?
Hey there, {NAME2}-kun.
Hey there.
Hey you! You've got a fierce look about you.
Hey {NAME1}-kun, so, I've\ngot a question...
Hey {NAME2}! When I say "summer" and "sports,"\nwhat comes to mind?
Hey {NAME2}-kun. Can I ask you to keep hanging out with Minami, for me?
Hey!
Hey! Are you busy today?
Hey! Are you even listening to me?
Hey! Bring me girls! Where are the girls!?
Hey! Don't look at me like I'm a stranger. We just met each other's Personas a minute ago!
Hey! First day on the job, huh?
Hey! Get outta the way! Nobody else can\nbuy a damn thing!
Hey! Give them the gift for manga.
Hey! Headin' to lunch?
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you!?\nFraud this, feline that, I'm a real cat\nwhether you like it or not!
Hey! I found one!
Hey! I wasn't that forceful!
Hey! I'm talking to you!
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing!?
Hey! Mos-san! That broken bone heal up yet?
Hey! Motoha's on our team!
Hey! My cup's empty! And get more girls over here!
Hey! Not you too, Kadota...
Hey! Over there! Is that...!
Hey! Rude! I mean you're right\u2014but rude!
Hey! Shiho!
Hey! Thanks for coming out today!
Hey! That is quite enough! Did you lose it in\nthe real world, perchance!?
Hey! That's ridiculous!
Hey! The meatballs are about to sell out.\nGo grab some more from the back.
Hey! This is a business, not a charity!
Hey! What are you mumbling over there, huh!?
Hey! What do you expect me to do when there's\nso much yummy food right in front of me!?
Hey! What the heck are you doing!? Let me go!
Hey! What's your problem, asshole!?
Hey! Where are you going!?
Hey! Who's that guy!?
Hey! You look like you've got nothing better\nto do!
Hey! You sure took your time.
Hey! You're giving away too much info!\nIn case you haven't realized, we've only\njust met each other!
Hey! You're staring into space again. Motoha's waiting. Let's go.
Hey!\nDon't you dare lump her in with those two!
Hey, Anderson-san. You free after this?
Hey, Cattle, what's your very favorite\nkind of meat?
Hey, Divine Justice was just updated. Apparently Hiromu Miyazawa tore apart another restaurant with his review.
Hey, Haruna-chan, why do you think the\nfloor here has this kinda pattern?
Hey, I bet it'll totally be worth the wait!\nHit me up when you open shop and I'll\nstop by!
Hey, I meant what I said. This was all my\nidea, after all! Go for it, I mean it.
Hey, I saw an adorable stuffed animal over\nthere... Or maybe it was a full-body mascot?
Hey, I was thinking the same! Let's go then!
Hey, I'll join you! Nothing like a stress\nrelief activity with friends!
Hey, I'm <color=#72C5FF>Bicorn</color>.
Hey, I'm back.
Hey, I'm no pet! And I told you already,\nI ain't a cat!
Hey, I'm still on a high schooler's budget,\nso go easy on me, okay?
Hey, I've been waiting for you. Sorry for\ntaking up your time.
Hey, Kurosawa. You've been hiding an injury, haven't you?
Hey, Kyo-kun, Yuna-chan, doesn't it sound\ncool to you too!?
Hey, Lufel. I've been meaning to say this for a while, but...
Hey, Lufel? I know this incident was written off as a coincidence...
Hey, Minami! Come give me a hand!
Hey, Minami! Have the kids gone home?
Hey, Minamiii! Setup's finished.
Hey, Miyazawa.
Hey, Mom, could you just...
Hey, Motoha... Do you ever miss baseball?
Hey, Motoha?
Hey, Ritsuka! Could you lend me a hand?
Hey, Shota-kun! Why don't you come explore\nwith us too?
Hey, Sumi-san, what do you do when you're\nfeeling depressed?
Hey, Tomoko-chan! Welcome, welcome!
Hey, Tsurumi and I were thinking that since\nwe're all here, we could play together once\nbefore heading home.
Hey, Wonder.\nGood job out there.
Hey, all I did was connect the dots! All you\nwere talking about was some old story!
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, are you doing anything right now?
Hey, are you free now?
Hey, are you free right now?
Hey, are you interested in joining the\nband club?
Hey, aren't you forgetting something?
Hey, asshat!
Hey, baldy.
Hey, can I come with you? I don't mind\nwaiting here, but it feels like a waste.
Hey, can you hear me? Could it be that you've\nfallen asleep?
Hey, can you tell me what they ordered?
Hey, could you tell me about the new shipment\nthat came in?
Hey, d'you still have time? Could you help me\nclean the home economics room?
Hey, did that eyeball just get dimmer?
Hey, did you just say ramen?
Hey, did you see that news? About the\nex-baseball player Kiuchi gettin' arrested.
Hey, did you see that sporty-looking girl\nover there? She's kinda cool...
Hey, did you see that video?
Hey, did you see the kitchen?
Hey, did you write that song yourself? Do you\nhave others?
Hey, do you have a minute? I wanted to tell\nyou something.
Hey, do you know anything about online\ndelivery? Like making a food order from\nyour cell phone?
Hey, do you know anywhere I could grow\nplants? Somewhere with a lot of space so\nthey can grow really, really big!
Hey, do you think this much money'd be\nenough to build a ballpark?
Hey, do you think we could do this again next\ntime you're free?
Hey, doesn't that mean Miyazawa will\ndefinitely be at Victory Kitchen on the\nday of the broadcast?
Hey, don't call me that!
Hey, don't sell yourself short! I bet you'll\nlove soccer if you just give it a shot!
Hey, don't sweat it! Just returning the\nfavor.
Hey, don't you dare go around thinking you've\none-upped me, or you'll regret it!
Hey, don't you feel like the rest of it got\nstronger after we took down the eye?
Hey, don't you think this idea's\nkind of boring considering the cost?
Hey, ever feel like you can't muster up interest in anything?
Hey, fancy meeting you here.
Hey, fellas, isn't there something strange\nabout these statues?
Hey, found another map.
Hey, friend! Did you hear? I helped her\nclose her final contract!
Hey, friend! I'm glad you came. She's on her\nway here right now.
Hey, friend! Perfect timing!
Hey, friend! She's on her way here right now.
Hey, guess what? I recently got\ninto cooking.
Hey, hang on! What malicious presence are\nwe talkin' about!?
Hey, have the intruders been by here?
Hey, haven't you been in there a little\ntoo long?
Hey, hey! {NAME2}, what's your\nschool like?
Hey, hey, Ko-to-ne! Hit them with that slide\nchasse!
Hey, hey, Mister! Let's play that\ngame again!
Hey, hey, don't fold so easily. I've lost matches before.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Trying to shift the\nblame onto me, are you!?
Hey, hold on a sec... Is it me, or am I\ngetting grilled for answers!?
Hey, how's it goin'? Feel like hitting the\nbatting cages?
Hey, if I can ask a favor, would you like to\nbe my mocktail taste-tester?
Hey, if you manage to live till eighty, that\nmeans you'll be able to drink for the next\nsixty years of your life!
Hey, is that a map of the palace?
Hey, is there a salon around here? Aah...\nI guess not.
Hey, is this a good time?
Hey, isn't it a bit unreasonable to start\nwith that amount of weight?
Hey, isn't that a bit weird? Looks like it's\nnot drainin' at all.
Hey, isn't that...?
Hey, it's Shun-kun! I haven't seen you around\nmuch lately. All good?
Hey, it's a busy station. It happens. Kid just got unlucky...
Hey, it's you again! Thanks for playing\nwith me before!
Hey, it's you again. Wanna join our band now?
Hey, kid, what're you lookin' at?
Hey, knock it off.
Hey, let's go back to exploring! We've still\ngot time before cram school.
Hey, let's hit the diner before going home!\nBut it's not my cheat day, so I'll skip the\nparfait!
Hey, let's keep going with this.
Hey, listen! Do you think I'll ever feel\nfulfilled like that?
Hey, look at that.
Hey, look at these! Cyber cauliflower seeds!
Hey, look at this.
Hey, look out!
Hey, look! That's...!
Hey, look! There's no fencing around that\nmachine!
Hey, mister. Wanna play with me?
Hey, no fighting!
Hey, no running in the halls!
Hey, now, that's way too many of 'em!
Hey, see that thing behind the guard? I swear\nit looks just like the other Core.
Hey, since we came all the way here... Wanna\nget some ice cream before we go?
Hey, since when was I wearing this outfit?
Hey, so I really need an answer from you ASAP.
Hey, so I've got a serious favor to\nask you...
Hey, so be real with me. Do you have\na GF right now, {NAME2}-chan?
Hey, so how late are these stores open?\nHow many people do you think work there?
Hey, so no pressure if you don't have\ntime, but...
Hey, so... I'm thinking of doing that\nchallenge with Tamayo.
Hey, thanks for coming in today.
Hey, that drink you've got there...
Hey, that looks super heavy...
Hey, that makes things simple. Plus, we\nknow this castle's ruler.
Hey, that's enough! Katayama-san\nwas just trying to stop you dumbasses\nfrom setting yourselves on fire!
Hey, that's far too low! Try again.
Hey, that's pretty normal! Regular exercise\nwill take care of it in no time!
Hey, that's too much! Try again...!
Hey, that's\u2014!
Hey, the cops are here!|Officer, there's a robbery!
Hey, the girl in the news looks like Arai.
Hey, the sound is getting closer, isn't it!?\nWe've been detected by the enemy!
Hey, there's an open window. Maybe we can\nget in from there?
Hey, there, I'm <color=#72C5FF>Bugs</color>!
Hey, this is no time for introductions!\nSenpai, why are you in the Metaverse?
Hey, this is the part where you agree!
Hey, this looks just like that <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>\nwe picked up earlier.
Hey, this mark on the door here... I can't\nreally make out what it is.
Hey, this place got a kitchen?
Hey, uh, let's get outta here.
Hey, um, {NAME1}-kun?
Hey, umm... {NAME1}. Sorry about fouling you earlier.
Hey, wai\u2014
Hey, wait! Don't run away! Tell meee!
Hey, wait... Did you just hear someone call\nfor help?
Hey, wake up!
Hey, wanna go to karaoke today?
Hey, wanna take a loop around the park?\nThere's boats and a lot of different stuff.
Hey, wanna walk back to the station together?
Hey, want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?\nIt'll be my treat!
Hey, wasn't that Kiuchi's voice just now?
Hey, we got a good spot! Let's get straight\nto it!
Hey, we gotta talk! Me and my hubby got\ninto an argument the other day.
Hey, we make a pretty great team together,\nhuh? Let's keep this ball rollin'!
Hey, we were looking everywhere for you two!
Hey, we were so worried about you!
Hey, what do you want to ride today? I was\nthinking...
Hey, what the hell? It's not even spitting\nout what I paid for! I want my money back!
Hey, what would you guys spend it on?
Hey, what're we gonna play today?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Hey, what's the matter? You seem to be\nstaring into space.
Hey, when did you guys get here?
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, who's that!?
Hey, why weren't you at the last club meeting?
Hey, you almost done?\nThey'll be back any minute!
Hey, you don't think Katayama-san's\nin the wrong, do you?
Hey, you know about that Divine Judgment website, right?
Hey, you see the news yesterday? They said the Subway Slammer was an ex-baseball star!
Hey, you stole my line just now! What are\nyou interrupting me like that for!?
Hey, you there! Want to make a trade?
Hey, you!
Hey, you! What are you doing!?
Hey, you! What're you doing there!?
Hey, you're here!
Hey, you're not... live-streaming right now,\nare you?
Hey, your chopsticks are slowing down!\nDon't tell me the sheer quantity has you\noverwhelmed!
Hey, {NAME1}! You seem to be wide awake.\nTry answering this one.
Hey, {NAME1}!\nTime for another fun practice!
Hey, {NAME1}, can you explain just what\nthe hell is goin\u2014
Hey, {NAME1}-kun! Are you free?
Hey, {NAME1}-kun! Fancy meetin' you here.
Hey, {NAME1}-kun, what's your\nfavorite kind of cr\xeape?
Hey, {NAME1}-kun. Are you doing anything\ntoday?
Hey, {NAME1}-san! Have a second?
Hey, {NAME1}-san! I wanna go somewhere with\nyou today.
Hey, {NAME1}. Is this a good time to talk?
Hey, {NAME1}. Let's go hard today!
Hey, {NAME1}. People always tell me\nI'm too serious.
Hey, {NAME1}. Tell me, what was a time when math\naffected history?
Hey, {NAME2}!
Hey, {NAME2}! You free now?
Hey, {NAME2}! You have a sec?
Hey, {NAME2}, are you good at school?
Hey, {NAME2}, do you have\na part-time job or anything?
Hey, {NAME2}, over here!
Hey, {NAME2}, you want some soda?
Hey, {NAME2}-chan? Are you like,\nactually super popular or something?
Hey, {NAME2}-kun. Do you know any place\nwhere I can study in peace?
Hey, {NAME2}-kun. Thanks for\ncoming today.
Hey, {NAME2}-kun? Could you come sit next\nto me?
Hey, {NAME2}.
Hey, {NAME2}. I'm off to try somethin' new.\nYou comin'?
Hey, {NAME2}. Little help?
Hey, {NAME2}. Ready for some ramen at Heritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya!?
Hey, {NAME2}. Wanna grab a bite? I'd like\nyou to try something.
Hey, {NAME2}. You hungry?
Hey, {NAME2}. You really know how to kick\nass without breaking a sweat.
Hey, {NAME2}... Sorry, I was chewin' on\nan idea...
Hey, {NAME2}?
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun! Pop quiz time!
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!\nI bet your chic little self will know this.
Hey.
Hey. Is this a good time to talk?
Hey. It's Motoha. Sorry to call so late. Can you turn on your TV right now?
Hey. Ritsuka's in the prep room.
Hey. This looks like it'll be an interesting match.
Hey. {NAME2}, have you been eating enough?
Hey...
Hey... Are you digging through garbage again?
Hey... Is it really okay for us keep going?
Hey... It won't be any better for you if people\nfind out that you called a maid service.
Hey... You don't actually intend to dig\naround in a garbage can, do you?
Heyo!
Heyyy! Look who it is! How've you been?
Hgh... Agh!
Hi there! Thanks for helping out! I've got my\nhands full right now.
Hi there, welcome...
Hi there. Kayo-san's been kind enough to let\nme stay here. Nice to meet you!
Hi there. Would you happen to have time\ntoday?
Hi! Thanks for lending a hand.
Hi, I'm {NAME1}.|What's she saying?
Hi, you two! I'm so sorry! My other job ran\ntoo long.
Hi, {NAME1}-kun!
Hi, {NAME1}-kun. Are you free today?
Hi, {NAME1}-kun. Would you happen to be free\ntoday?
Hi, {NAME1}-kun. Would you happen to be\nfree today?
Hi.|Spare change?
Hide and strike while the enemy is unaware!\nThat's how a phantom thief should fight.
Hideout?|Sounds cool.
Hidin' back there like a coward...! Come out\nand face us fair and square!
High school has classes like physics\nand literature and world history, right!?
High school math is all weird symbols.\nI can't tell what it's even supposed to mean.
High school!?
Hikaru Genji wasn't someone who just threw\nhis past lovers to the curb. He gave them not\njust a home, but a certain lifestyle.
Him too, of course.\nWe're all going to the same place, aren't we?
Hindering someone's desires...|What are you trying to say?
Hiromu Miyazawa takes the stage!
Hiromu Miyazawa!? Why are you here?
Hiromu Miyazawa?|Some acquaintance of yours?
Hiromu... Miyazawa...
Hiroto! Are you all right!?
His attitude would probably improve if he changed his outlook on things...
His conduct earned him the support of the\npeople, and he was even given a nickname...
His deep compassion makes it hard to imagine\nhim pulling one over on this mastermind.\nThat takes Shun out of the running.
His desire was formed from love, knowledge,\nand passion... Marvelous, indeed.
His despicability knows no bounds. Which makes him a fitting target for robbing.
His employee ID was the only close-up,\nso I thought it must be important...
His essays are chock full of training tips,\nbut he also talks about his daily routine.
His favorite... What is Leo-chan's favorite?
His heart's completely changed...\nIncredible...
His name was Fujiwara no Michinaga. There's a fun story of him realizing he's cursed!
His pen is a sword or something.|He has a katana tongue.
His pitch got knocked out of the park by a grade-school-aged Motoha Arai...
His portrait.|His tombstone.|His birthday cake.
His unwavering spirit must be the key\nto his <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>.
His wall was repaired and relocated during\nseveral later dynasties before it took shape\nas the Great Wall as we know it today.
His way of satisfying a certain desire. A most repellent kind of human.
His wealth.|His style.|His radiance.
His what? Oh, you mean those lame\nspecs he wears?
Hit her with the truth!|Choose your words carefully.|You have to say what you feel.
Hit her with the truth... Yeah... Hit 'er\nwith the truth!
Hit-and-run Rider? Ugh, what a pain.
Hitting an opponent's <color=#FF423F>weakness</color> lets\nyou do a <color=#FF423F>follow-up</color> attack.
Hiyaaaaaaaaah!
Hiyah!
Hm, I see. We don't have time\nto go back for one either, do we?
Hm, are you okay, Cattle?
Hm, like for example...
Hm, maybe we got the order wrong?
Hm, seems like Kiuchi's past is playing here as well. This must be a continuation of the story.
Hm, so you've come to.
Hm, that timing sounds just right.
Hm, that's a reasonable response.
Hm, there's a box behind that grate...
Hm, this room has a strange mechanism...
Hm, yeah, I thought you might say that...
Hm-hm hm-hmm<sprite=1 tint=1>\nHmhm-hmmm<sprite=1 tint=1>
Hm. I can't say where exactly, but I sense\nanother treasure chest around here...
Hm. I see, I see...
Hm. In short, you are still trying to find\nyourself.
Hm. It's originally a French word, it seems.\nIt roughly translates to "assembly."
Hm. That's weird. Wouldn't expect to hear\nCattle say something like that.
Hm. The hue makes it look palatable, but...
Hm. Well, it's better than losing.
Hm...
Hm... All right.
Hm... As Katayama releases her wrath through\nthose attacks, the light in the eyes grows\nfaint. However...
Hm... Even then, it's good to be able to make\nwhatever what you want!
Hm... I guess it sounds kind of interesting?
Hm... It looks like it requires a special\nkind of key.
Hm... It might be easier to just let you see\nit for yourself.
Hm... It seems they've set traps along this\npassage...
Hm... Maybe if I did some kind of cheer\nbefore singing? Like sports teams do?
Hm... No good. I can't hear anything about\nthe next Palace's ruler...
Hm... Okay, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nSee if you can get this one.
Hm... The middle letter is C... Balaclava?\nNo, that won't work...
Hm... This room seems to be laid out\nin the same way.
Hm... This underground area seems even\nlarger than I imagined.
Hm... Was that a little too dramatic?\nBut it's true. And I would be lying if I said\nI didn't want to escape, too.
Hm... What have we here? I've never seen\nsuch a contraption before.
Hm...?
Hm...? Looks like that struck a chord with you, huh?
Hm...? There appears to be someone near\nthe entrance.
Hm?
Hm? Do I look anxious? Well, I suppose there\nis something bothering me...
Hm? Do you not use names anymore?
Hm? I mean, the role the director wants me to\nperform...
Hm? I see, yes...
Hm? If something were inside me, I think I\nwould know... But if you insist.
Hm? Is that...?
Hm? It seems to be missin' a place to put\nthe film in.
Hm? It's cute, you say? No, that's not what\nI meant...!
Hm? Looks like they dropped something.\nIs this... a baseball?
Hm? Not only do they want photos of the food,\nbut of the stand, too?
Hm? Oh, did you try out the recipe from the\nother day at home?
Hm? That Shadow drop somethin'?
Hm? That installation... Is it new?
Hm? That meowing... Could that be the orange\ntabby's friend?
Hm? That uniform...
Hm? That voice... Is it another video from Kiuchi's past?
Hm? That was normal for me.
Hm? That's weird. Where is it?
Hm? There's a note here.\nIt's got some numbers written on it.
Hm? U-Uh, can I help you...?
Hm? Uh, well, I suppose...
Hm? Uhhh...
Hm? Well, I want to express my own kind of...
Hm? What is it, Kano-kun?
Hm? What is it, Lufel?
Hm? What is it? Let me see!
Hm? What was?
Hm? What's the matter? Trying to ask for\ndirections, young man?
Hm? What's up?
Hm? Yes, well done. The answer is apple.
Hm? You need something? I'm kinda busy\nchecking the Divine Judgment story\nright now...
Hm? You're interested in my PC?\nMweheh, this is my masterpiece right here!
Hmhm, a splendid display of desire.\nLet us begin.
Hmhm, exactly right, Yaoling-san. I see\nyou've done your research on the area.
Hmhm, have I piqued your interest?\nSuch praise is the greatest blessing\nan artist can have.
Hmhmhm! Every aspect, from tea temperature\nto the order the sweets are brought out, is\ncarefully choreographed.
Hmhmhm! Strange. My heart feels so warm and\nfull right now.
Hmm, I could learn from you and Ren...\nI wonder if I can cut the curry ingredients?
Hmm, I expected you to come to that conclusion.
Hmm, I just don't know what to go with...
Hmm, I see, I see. So this is the kind of\nhouse Sensei lives in.
Hmm, I see, I see...
Hmm, I see. I understand what you're saying.
Hmm, I see... Yes, before there were very\nfew people I could call actual friends.
Hmm, I think I see where you're going with\nthis...
Hmm, I'd say this one seems to fit\nthe criteria.
Hmm, I'm not feeling like anything in\nparticular... I'll have whatever's the\nmost popular.
Hmm, but maybe having such a kind attitude\nis what draws so many people to you?
Hmm, but...
Hmm, chamomile... We have some left in stock,\nbut not much, to be honest.
Hmm, did you hear that...? I think that's\nunlocked it, Wonder.
Hmm, good point.
Hmm, good question... To be honest, at times,\nI just enjoy lashing it about.
Hmm, inspiration might strike me today.
Hmm, it seems that we can use this camera.
Hmm, now that I'm hearing it from you,\nmaybe you are right!
Hmm, perhaps I could have given you a better\nhint... I'm afraid the answer was "Deadball."
Hmm, seems the door unlocked itself. I suppose looking at the photo was the key.
Hmm, so this is what's fashionable in the\ncurrent era... I see.
Hmm, so you have something specific in mind. And judging by your face, you want a lot of it.
Hmm, that apron suits you.
Hmm, that's a good question. It's kinda hard\nto put into words...
Hmm, that's outside of my field of expertise,\nbut I don't think it'd cause a big problem\nthere.
Hmm, there's another camera here...
Hmm, this isn't good... What should I do?
Hmm, unfortunately not. The answer was\nwashing hands and general disinfecting.
Hmm, well, considering how great he was,\nhe may have done many things overseas.
Hmm, yes, it does appear that way.\nBut, you're wrong. It's Lower Egypt.
Hmm. I'm not sure roses are the best choice\nin this case.
Hmm. Is it time to roll credits already?
Hmm. The desire between lovers is truly\ninexplicable.
Hmm. Well, no need to sweat the details.\nYou don't seem dangerous, anyway!
Hmm. Yes, we are a large group now. Perhaps\nwe wouldn't have trouble with those enemies.
Hmm. You didn't appear to be human from\nafar, and it seems I was correct.
Hmm. You raise a fair point.
Hmm...
Hmm... Asset management is pretty important,\ndon't you think?
Hmm... But there are a lotta people here,\nso you might have some competition for\nthe role.
Hmm... Did you not hear the hint I gave you?\nHe had a fever! So it began to boil!
Hmm... Do you think alcohol is really\nthat tasty?
Hmm... For example, do you think it'd work\nif I followed that part like this?
Hmm... For my next job...
Hmm... From the sound of it, you've been\nseparated as well?
Hmm... I ask that you please do visit, if you\nso desire.
Hmm... I don't know...
Hmm... I guess not. You don't run into many\nbad apples these days, I suppose.
Hmm... I guess that is an option.
Hmm... I have my doubts.
Hmm... I see. I feel like I'm getting closer\nto understanding but am still oh so far away.
Hmm... I see. Then perhaps we ought to take\nthe day off.
Hmm... I sense that this is the right way.
Hmm... I think it would be nice to dress up\nlike a character I loved as a child.
Hmm... Important <color=#FF423F>books</color>?
Hmm... It doesn't seem as though this door\nis going to open. Let's look around a little\nmore and see what we can find, Wonder.
Hmm... It likely gives us the counterfeit\nbills only to collect them again.
Hmm... It likely gives us the fake cash only\nto collect it again.
Hmm... Makes me wonder what sort of desire\none can derive from your name.
Hmm... Maybe some adventure is just\nwhat I need?
Hmm... Maybe we can make use of\nthat Shadow's cold air somehow.
Hmm... Not sure that would cut the mustard.\nThe answer is sealing it in a bag.
Hmm... Perhaps there is something that we\nstill need to do, Wonder.
Hmm... Sorry, but I've got a date with my\nlats and lumbar extensors today.
Hmm... That can be useful, but memorization\nalone can make it difficult to put what you\nlearn to practical use.
Hmm... That's maybe not the best choice right\nnow. Any other ideas, Sensei?
Hmm... The shop's bustling again today.
Hmm... This Kamoshida fellow sounds like\na human with rather fine taste.
Hmm... This camera appears to be slightly\ndifferent.
Hmm... This castle seems rather\nlabyrinthine...
Hmm... This doesn't appear to be Mementos.\nSomething has clearly gone awry.
Hmm... This floor seems far more difficult\nthan the others... Keep your wits about you,\nWonder!
Hmm... This is a hard one.
Hmm... This is an interesting result.\nPerhaps you should try demonstrating your\nkindness today.
Hmm... This is harder than I expected.
Hmm... This is merely speculation, but it\nappears to be a frenzy of turbulent desires\nthat have accumulated here.
Hmm... This may be a space in the Metaverse\nheretofore unknown to us.
Hmm... This next customer is staring at\ntheir phone too. They must be checking\nthose trends as well.
Hmm... This space seems to have a very\ndifferent feel from the Velvet Room.
Hmm... Very well, then. It seems we are\nboth just as in the dark as each other.
Hmm... We couldn't before, but I concede,\ngiving it a try would be worthwhile.
Hmm... Well, I guess I can let you give me\na few strokes. But! Don't touch my tail!
Hmm... Well, there are plenty of marathon\nevents open to the general public.
Hmm... What part-time job should I try\nout next?
Hmm... Yeah, I can see that.
Hmm... Yeah. You're right. It'll work out...\nBecause we love each other.
Hmm... Your house seems to have a suitable place for either.
Hmm... a motif for the painting... I feel\nsomething coming to me but...
Hmm...?
Hmm...? I think that might have changed\nsomething...
Hmm?
Hmm? Hold on... what were we trying to\ndo again?
Hmm? Oh that. We terminated the contract for\nthe training equipment, no prob.
Hmm? Oh, no, I don't have any particular\nplans in the park today.
Hmm? What does that mean? It's kinda like...
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, I can't hear you\nwhen you mumble like that... Hey, your phone\nkeeps goin' off. You gonna check it?
Hmm? What's wrong? Is there something you\nwant to talk about?
Hmmm, as amazing as that sounds...
Hmmm, how should I put this?
Hmmm, maybe it's some kind of mnemonic?
Hmmm, what should I get?
Hmmm.
Hmmm. Basil seedlings...
Hmmm. I see what you're saying about this\nplace.
Hmmm. I've gotten so used to Russet,\nnothing else seems to fit quite as well.
Hmmm...
Hmmm... A place of respite, I suppose?\nI would be remiss if I ruined the surprise.
Hmmm... A reckless cyclist known as the\nHit-and-run Rider. No one knows their\nname or face.
Hmmm... I was actually hoping you could help\nme figure that out.
Hmmm... I wonder what sort of training a\nPhantom Thief should do?
Hmmm... Well, when you put it that way,\nI'd better put my back into it, huh?
Hmmm... Wink doesn't feel all that\nmysterious.
Hmmm... You can't go wrong with milk tea,\nbut I really think some Longjing would hit\nthe spot right now.
Hmmm... You grow potatoes, so you can be...\nPotato-kun!
Hmmm... really? I felt like the soup was missing something.
Hmmm?
Hmmm? The ball seems to fit perfectly, but...
Hmph! Hup, hup! Heheh!
Hmph! I was going to say that...!
Hmph! If you can't do it without your suit,\nthen you don't deserve to call yourself a hero!
Hmph! Upsy... daisy!
Hmph! You copycat... How dare you steal\nmy moment of brilliance!?
Hmph, all right.
Hmph, what's special about that musty\nold thing...
Hmph.
Hmph. Automatic lock, eh?
Hmph. What an incontrovertibly self-serving, egoistic desire. Punishing women for problems he created himself.
Hmph... Fine then. I will ask no more.
Hmph... I don't follow your reasoning,\nbut I suppose I'm not opposed to it.
Hmph... I guess even being able to make that\nrealization shows I've grown a bit.
Hmph... Must've just gotten lucky. But\nI must commend your strategy, just this once.
Hmph... Well, whatever.
Hmph... Who would you rather have as a\nteacher, Shun?
Hmph... You leave me no choice. So your\nfeeble brains can comprehend...
Hngh...
Hngh\u2014
Ho ho, now wouldn't that be a funny future to look forward to!
Hold it, Kadota! What about your steel-willed striker, Yota Kurosawa!?
Hold on a second!
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second. Shouldn't we at least see\nif we can get outta here normally before we\ndo anything?
Hold on a second. So you guys know about\nTreasure?
Hold on, Shun! Don't be so rash!\n{NAME2}, talk some sense into him!
Hold on, Wonder, I'm sensing a dangerous\npresence...
Hold on, Wonder.
Hold on, could that be...
Hold on, how are you even able to sense\nsomething like that, Cattle?
Hold on, this doesn't look like Mementos.
Hold on, we can't be the only ones\nsharing information here, either.
Hold on. I sense Shadows...
Hold on. There seems to be a powerful\nShadow just beyond this door.
Hold on. These students were engaged in\nincredibly dangerous behavior.
Hold on. We need to find the others first!
Hold on... Are you offering to lend me\nan ear!?
Hold on... Isn't that the treasure chest from\nMiyazawa's Palace?
Hold onto your socks, people, cause they're\nabout to blow off when I tell you...
Hold that thought! School's our top priority\nright now. Classes will finish if we're just\nstanding around here all day!
Hold up a sec! Who're you to talk? What\nthe hell're you supposed to be anyway!?
Hold your desires close, {PLAYER_NAME},\nor you'll end up like that.
Hold your horses, Skull! That door's not\ngoing to fall to a couple kicks.
Holy cow! All the people here are so trendy!
Honestly though, the beach house's food was\npretty expensive, wasn't it?
Honestly, Akashi aside, I never believed\nKatayama-san could be a Palace ruler.
Honestly, I can't even bring myself to think about what to do after graduation...
Honestly, I didn't expect our conversation\nearlier to lead us straight here.
Honestly, I don't even remember crashing\nthrough the train like it said on\nDivine Justice.
Honestly, I hesitated on accepting someone\nlike you...
Honestly, I might not be. But I have to pull through today.
Honestly, I really wish people would think\ntwice before they say that math is useless\nor pointless.
Honestly, I wouldn't know what to do with\nall this money.
Honestly, humans these days...
Honestly, the situation is most\nperplexing. However, what I do\nknow is...
Honestly, though, it's all so solemn and\ndignified in here. Don't wanna get in\nthe way.
Honestly, what's gotten into you?
Honestly... I think we both know there's no\nway I can beat Tamayo.
Honor student. Worthy heir.
Hoo hoo! Good show! I'd expect no less of\nyou, {NAME2}!
Hoo hoo! It's so beautiful now I barely\nrecognize it!
Hoo hoo! Now, shall we board the elevator\nand head for the treasure?
Hoo hoo! That appears to have been the\nright order!
Hoo hoo! To think you were able to\nconcentrate amidst all this distraction.
Hoo hoo! What luck!
Hoo hoo! You downed it in one gulp!
Hoo hoo! You made it this far already?
Hoo hoo, a true Phantom Bond!
Hoo hoo, excellent form!
Hoo hoo, taking on the bench press today?
Hoo hoo. It was truly a feast for the eyes.\nWell, shall we be going?
Hoo hoo... I found you.
Hoo hoot! What a haul!
Hoo my, you are truly in the zone. I'll\nleave you to it.
Hoo! Finally, the sweet taste of stewed eggs\nand roast pork! *shlurp*
Hoo! The shutters over there opened.
Hoo! Your pen hasn't stopped moving!\nYour rapid progress is nothing short\nof incredible.
Hoo!? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? This hood\nis hip! With it! The bee's knees!
Hoo!? What is it? You suddenly grew pale.
Hoo, a planetarium? I had no idea such a\nthing existed in Ikebukuro.
Hoo, a small flower might fit the bill\nquite nicely.
Hoo, chats are quite the convenient\ncontrivance. People can relay thoughts to\neach other without meeting in person.
Hoo, how skilled. You even made extra.
Hoo, how skilled. You even saved on materials.
Hoo, it seems you really can hear my voice.\nI knew I sensed potential for hope in you.
Hoo, that's correct.
Hoo, the subtle flavor is to your liking? It\nseems your expression has softened as well.
Hoo, this bar has a unique ambience. I sense\ndesire not found elsewhere.
Hoo, time flew by quicker than I expected.\nHow far did you manage to get?
Hoo, we're up to our ears today.
Hoo, what a productive day.
Hoo, what a rewarding shift.
Hoo, what an eventful day.
Hoo, what impeccable hospitality.
Hoo, your expression has changed. You have\nthe look of someone who frequents\nthis establishment.
Hoo... Do you hear water?
Hoo... First, let us look for the\ncontrol device.
Hoo... I hear a voice coming from the\ndepths of Mementos.
Hoo... It's nice to rest like this every once\nin a while.
Hoo... So this is the strange area I sensed?
Hoo... That cloud looks like braised pork...
Hoo... The alarm finally stopped...
Hoo... The shutter opened!\nWell done, Wonder!
Hoo... We've barely had time to catch our\nbreath so far. A break is in order.
Hoo? Ah, I suppose you're right.
Hooaaah!
Hooaaah! Do not pull that! I'm sensitive\nthere!
Hooaha! Hooahahaha! Th-That tickles! There is\nnothing down there, I swear it!
Hooded ghost?
Hoohm, greetings. You're quite congenial for\nthe morning. Sorry to pester you first thing,\nbut I have something to report.
Hoohoo! A fellow meat lover!
Hoohoo! A misconception derived from only looking at things from a map.
Hoohoo! A new route awaits.
Hoohoo! An excellent choice.
Hoohoo! Bursting with desire as ever. I knew you were a dependable leader.
Hoohoo! Cooked it yourself then, did you?\nIn that case, I wouldn't mind helping myself\nto some of that meat.
Hoohoo! Finally, someone who gets it!
Hoohoo! How dark and comfy. All right,\nnow let me out already.
Hoohoo! I see. An <color=#FF423F>airsoft shop</color>?
Hoohoo! Just as I thought. It may be the\nelusive password.
Hoohoo! Not a single speck of dust!
Hoohoo! Now here's an establishment\nI can accompany you into!
Hoohoo! What ferocious offense! How will you\nturn the tides?
Hoohoo! You know your books. I suppose I\nshouldn't be surprised.
Hoohoo! You look mightily refreshed.
Hoohoo, I do value your decisiveness!\nLet's go, Wonder!
Hoohoo, already putting it into practice!\nThat's our Wonder.
Hoohoo, and that's why you're my business partner.
Hoohoo, caught you off-guard, didn't I?
Hoohoo, dependable as ever. Since we're here, shall we proceed to the next area?
Hoohoo, go ahead! Let the strength of that desire feed your creativity.
Hoohoo, it brings to mind a rather amusing\nscenario... Perhaps you should try it on\nthe Phantom Thieves!
Hoohoo, just as I thought.
Hoohoo, looks like crafting infiltration tools has given you some confidence. Splendid!
Hoohoo, perhaps that's a good sign. Your\nPersona has only just awakened, after all.
Hoohoo, since we're here, why not savor the\nmoment a while longer?
Hoohoo, such initiative.
Hoohoo, that's my way of saying you're a\nreliable leader. I have high hopes for your\nefforts going forward.
Hoohoo, that's right. Well calculated.
Hoohoo, the human form still has room for\nimprovement, from the sound of it!
Hoohoo, welcome aboard.
Hoohoo, well done, Wonder! I was right to\ntrust this to you.
Hoohoo, well that makes me want it all the more.
Hoohoo, what desires would lead to\nsuch discoveries? I'd like to see for\nmyself someday.
Hoohoo, whatever could it taste like? Go on,\ngive it a try.
Hoohoo, you appear deep in thought. What a\nkindly countenance.
Hoohoo, you should already be aware of this.
Hoohoo, you were quite entrenched in your\nthoughts. Well then, shall we be off?
Hoohoo, your efforts have been rewarded.
Hoohoo, your face brims with confidence.\nWhile we're here, might as well take a moment\nto unwind.
Hoohoo. I can tell from your face that\nyou agree.
Hoohoo. We're here, so why not relax and\nenjoy the bar's ambience?
Hoohoo... A thrilling undertaking for phantom\nthieves. Let's go, Wonder!
Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely, but\nperhaps we should change before heading home?
Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely, but\nperhaps we should change clothes\nbefore heading home?
Hoohoo... An interesting idea. Let's quickly\ntest it, Wonder.
Hoohoo... But before we enter, a word\nof advice.
Hoohoo... I never realized education and\nphantom thievery had so much in common.
Hoohoo... It seems a treasure chest\nhas appeared.
Hoohoo... Ms. Katayama gets it.
Hoohoo... Now isn't that convenient?
Hoohoo... That is rather curious indeed!\nAlthough I'm also quite interested in those\ntwo empty frames over there...
Hoohoo... This is good for us. We can use\nthis as a pathway.
Hoohoo... You are now quite adept at this.
Hoohoo...! So you want to push through here.\nYou truly are the embodiment\nof a Phantom Thief... Heh.
Hoohoo? I've never used such a hand warmer.\nWhat a fascinating contrivance.
Hoohoom, if you keep looking so defeated,\nRiko may have to take your place as leader.
Hooky? Haha...
Hoom! I sense a presense much stronger\nthan the other shadows... Be on your guard,\nWonder!
Hoom! So, they really used cement back then?\nThey were as sophisticated as people\nare today!
Hoom, "touching" is an interesting way to put it. 
Hoom, I sense a minor shift in your aura.
Hoom, a calling card, huh?
Hoom, according to the manual,\nfor strawberry cream...
Hoom, indeed. However... there are some areas\nthat we cannot reach. For now, let us keep\nmoving forward.
Hoom, it is indeed unpleasant to be lumped\ninto a group and generalized about like that!
Hoom, it looks like it did not disappoint.
Hoom, it seems we can use that key here.
Hoom, it's as Wonder says. I don't sense\nthe presence of enemy Shadows here.
Hoom, it's over...
Hoom, looks like there's a note by the phone.
Hoom, so it appears.
Hoom, so that girl used her quick wits and\npersuasiveness to get her way...
Hoom, this drink has a tranquil hue, but...
Hoom, we should be ready to complete that\ndeal with Marthym now!
Hoom, what on earth? Is that... a wooden\ntraining dummy?
Hoom, while I'm not against it, I don't think\nwe should be making this decision lightly...
Hoom, you don't seem to be making\nmuch progress.
Hoom, you look thoroughly spent.
Hoom, you look thoroughly spent. How about\ncooling down and heading out?
Hoom, you're going too fast. Pace yourself.
Hoom, you're right. As with that training\nexercise earlier, who knows what awaits us?\nWe must proceed with caution.
Hoom. How about hopping on the\ntreadmill today?
Hoom. I do suppose it could be worth a try.\nBut do be careful not to provoke any\nunwanted attention.
Hoom. In other words, while a foreign custom\nmay seem nonsensical to us, it still has its\nown purpose and history. How intriguing.
Hoom. Interacting with those animals seems\nto have had a positive effect on you.
Hoom. It sounds like everything we hope for.
Hoom. It's quiet and peaceful here.
Hoom. So you'll be starting with dishwashing\nduty today.
Hoom. The looped snake motif reminds me\nof an ouroboros.
Hoom. There must be a locked treasure chest\nsomewhere. Let's search for it.
Hoom. They seem to be pleased with our\nperformance.
Hoom. While much of the technobabble went\nover my head, it was certainly quite the\nexhilarating story!
Hoom. Your unanimous bravery in the face of\nsuch peril is heartening.
Hoom. Your unanimous bravery in the face\nof such peril is heartening.
Hoom... A compromise, is it? Very well.\nI accept your terms.
Hoom... A fragment of a key of some sort?
Hoom... All of the rooms have been locked.
Hoom... All the traps in this area should be\ndisarmed now. Well done.
Hoom... Based on the collective unconscious,\nwe thought this was Katayama's Palace, but...
Hoom... But there was something odd about\nthe way he referred to Katayama as\nthe supervisor.
Hoom... Could you try running for me again?
Hoom... Customer service appears to be a\npaltry task for you.
Hoom... For some reason, you're aglow with a\nsense of triumph.
Hoom... I believe Closer is right, this\nrequires further observation.
Hoom... I can tell you care for these plants\nby your tender administrations.
Hoom... I'm not sensing any hostility from it.
Hoom... If Akashi finds a new power source,\nthe Palace's security might ease up.
Hoom... In short, I suppose this could be\nconsidered the dam's control room.
Hoom... It appears our attacks are having\na harder time connecting.
Hoom... It appears that we lost.
Hoom... It could be another way through.\nLet us proceed, then.
Hoom... It may have to do with the Palace\nbeing shaped like a dam.
Hoom... Let's bring it with us. Let's look\nfor other chains.
Hoom... Let's continue on then, Wonder.
Hoom... Now looks to be a good stopping\npoint. Shall we head out?
Hoom... Perhaps it has something to do with\nthe guards he summoned.
Hoom... Perhaps we can disable the infrared\nsensors with this.
Hoom... Problematic by today's moral\nstandards, but his sense of loyalty toward\nhis companions is commendable.
Hoom... Putting aside any favoritism, such\ntricks could also be useful for our\nMetaverse battles.
Hoom... Quite a lot of enemies here...
Hoom... Seems there are still some\nenemies left.
Hoom... Shall we go back and check?
Hoom... Shall we try to observe the Shadow\nin question further?
Hoom... She has a point. Current common\nknowledge could easily be shelved by\nnew discoveries.
Hoom... So the route you take is key. If you\ndon't progress efficiently, your enemies\nwill outmatch you.
Hoom... So, today's humans have even lost\ntheir desire to stay healthy?
Hoom... That is unusual, but it's because of\nthat that we were able to get in. We should\nconsider it serendipitous.
Hoom... That seems to be our only option.
Hoom... That treasure chest is sealed with\nchains. I wonder what might happen if we\n<color=#FF423F>defeated the Shadow</color> beside it...
Hoom... The path is blocked.
Hoom... The security cameras here\nseem different from ones we've encountered\nthus far.
Hoom... There are even days with medicinal\nbaths. They're sure to have many effects.
Hoom... There don't seem to be many other\npeople using it.
Hoom... There should be clues nearby.
Hoom... There's another grate in the way.
Hoom... Time seems to have flown by.
Hoom... To think that they could take on a\ncorporation like that with only a single\nblade!
Hoom... To think there would be a switch\nhidden here.
Hoom... We can't go in here. Let's try again\nanother time.
Hoom... We want to progress the story, but\nthis boss is quite challenging.
Hoom... Well, the Treasure we seek is in\na class of its own...
Hoom... Were the corners truly this dusty?\nWell spotted.
Hoom... Wonder, a moment? Does something\nabout that Pixie seem strange to you?
Hoom... You could hear a feather drop. Why,\nit's the perfect environment for studying!
Hoom... Your singing certainly has room for\nimprovement.
Hoom? Has your posture improved? You could\nbe mistaken for a Zen master with such a\nstatuesque pose.
Hoom? Hold on a second, Wonder.\nLook at that.
Hoom? This guy seems to know a lot about whatever's going on between the shop and Miyazawa.
Hoom? This looks promising!
Hoom? Was that...?
Hoom? What is it? You need my assistance?
Hoom? Where are we?
Hoom? Why is there dirt here of all places?
Hoom? {NAME2}?
Hoomph, I see! Excessive wealth can actually\nhave a negative effect on one's desires,\nit seems.
Hoomph, there's something familiar about\nthe music they're playing in here...
Hoomph. According to the procedure, you just\nput in the filling and wrap it up. Take it\neasy and you should have no problem.
Hoomph. More of that irrepressible curiosity, is it? I suppose I have to tell you then.
Hoomph... Every time you people see thief\nclothes it turns into a "who's the most\nconfounded" contest...
Hoomph... Perhaps that is deliberate.\nThey could be hiding something from those who\ndon't know its meaning.
Hoomph... This new film sounds quite\nintriguing. Its title is well designed to\nstoke desire.
Hoooooo!?
Hope is... lost?|What makes you say that?
Hope to see you again soon!
Hope to see you again!
Hope we meet again.
Hope. I can sense traces of exploited desire around here.
Hopefully hearing that the bad guy's been caught will make her feel at least a little bit better.
Hopefully the customer will like them too.
Hopefully this'll help you get a feel for it.
Hopefully we'll find some information\nabout our missing allies here...
Hopefully! Guess we'll have to wait till\nnext week. So exciting!
Housed within your psyche there exists not\njust one personality\u2014or Persona\u2014but multiple.
Housekeeping Service!
How 'bout it, friend?\nWanna put it to the test?
How 'bout you, {NAME2}?\nYou got any special training regime?
How about I, as a third party, check it?\nIf there truly is a problem,\nthen I'll delete it.
How about Motoha?|How about Shun?|Can't you do it?
How about Russet? That's a kind of potato.
How about a drink while we talk? No alcohol, of course.
How about a trip down memory lane? Your\noffenses, your crimes...! I'll make you\nremember... in excruciating detail.
How about cooking?|How about cleaning?
How about cooling down and heading out?
How about hot pot? A hot pot party!
How about it? Wanna cast a line?
How about it? You look like you could go for\nsome grilled chicken!
How about the Ferris wheel?|Give the roller coaster a go!
How about this? I'll sign the contract\nas you originally planned. That'll fix\neverything!
How about we get up to a little mischief!?
How about we go for round two? I'll make you\nsomething a little different.
How about we go to our usual bench at\nInokashira Park?
How about we head to the library first?
How about we just go public with this? Let\neveryone know that Miyazawa sabotaged Victory\nKitchen's flavor with cheap ingredients.
How about we play one last song together,\nbefore we call it for today?
How about we see some appreciation first, huh?
How about we start by looking for Shadows\nthat fit that description?
How about we take a little break?
How about you, Soy?|What would you buy, Soy?
How about you, {NAME1}? You've got "hungry" written all over your face.
How about... {NAME1}-kun today. Take a look\nat this chart.
How am I supposed to support him if I'm just\nstressing him out all the time?
How are "flammable" and "inflammable" different?
How are you doing?
How are you?|I came to see you.
How big? Hmmm... About... this size?
How can I be of service?
How can I ever make up for my...
How can I find them?|Are they here today?
How can I say no to that?|I'll do it for the orange tabby.
How can I say that I want to become a nurse to help others when there is someone in need right in front of me?
How can I say this... Recently I feel like\nI'm being driven into a corner.
How can I sleep after that damn Miyazawa came by...
How can that be?|I can't believe it.
How could I refuse?|I'm sorry, I can't...
How could I!?
How could we not give it our all when you're\nhere cheering us on?
How could we not! You're sooo cool,\nYumi-chan! I could watch you bartend for,\nlike, ever!
How could you!? Starting the party without\nme!?
How dare that vile man exploit a precious\nidol like Naruru and try to steal her dreams\naway!
How dare you liken me to that thing! And\ndon't call me a hooded goblin!
How dare you!
How dare you! Enough of your insolence!
How dare you! My crown...!\nYou'll pay for this!
How dare you! These are my valued customers. You're the ones who should leave.
How dare you\u2014
How did I end up falling asleep in a place\nlike this?
How did I...?
How did a loner like me get to make such\na remarkable friend like you?
How did he get here...?
How did it taste? Did it go okay?
How did the Canary Islands get their name?\nThis is another case of a misunderstanding.
How did the contract go?|Did the woman call you?
How did you know?|You guessed it...
How did you manage?|You'd know better than me.|Maybe use a microphone?
How did you\u2014
How do I break the ice?
How do I put it? Her flair just seems so...\nelegant. She's mesmerizing.
How do these look?|I got some good ones.
How do they even stay in business?
How do we do that?|Can we do anything?
How do you do it, {NAME1}-san? It's like you\ncan see right through me.
How do you do? You're {NAME2}, correct?\nMy name is Haru Okumura. Nice to meet you!
How do you feel about it?
How do you feel about the club so far?\nNo bad experiences, surprises, or anything\nlike that, right?
How do you know about that?|Do you know who it is?
How do you know our names?
How do you know that!?
How do you know that...? I guess you really are Kiuchi.
How do you know that?|This room feels different somehow...
How do you like these muscles?
How do you see your desires, {NAME2}?
How do you see yourself?
How do you usually occupy your time while you\nare here?
How enthralling! The two chefs were so close\nto being caught at numerous points,\nyet they always maintained their cool...
How is that owl talking...?
How isn't that related to marriage?\nAs your teacher, I'm concerned about\nyour listening skills.
How long can I put up with this? This is\njust my life...
How lovely. It's like you can smell the youth\nin the air here!
How many chefs have you stolen pride and\npurpose away from!?
How many haiku did Ihara Saikaku make\nin a day? Remember, he was a legend!
How many people's dreams have you killed to\nspite the one you threw away yourself!?
How many shops have you shut down? How many\nsmiles have you wiped away?
How many times do I have to tell you I'm not forcing myself, you idiot!
How may I\u2014Oh, it's you.
How much more can he want...? I feel like\nI just got some the other day.
How narcissistic am I?
How nice of you to remember. Not many still\ndo so long after my injury.
How oddly relaxing... It certainly exceeds\nmodest expectations.
How overcome with desire is this Kaneshiro?\nNevermind. Heading underground comes first.
How pathetic.|Despicable.
How promising. Let's have a taste then.
How rare. This woman appears to possess desires. Let's hear her out.
How shall we torture you then? Hahahahah!
How shameful. A teacher should set a good\nexample. Not go on reckless joyrides.
How so?
How so?|No need to apologize.
How strange. And here I was sure I'd performed a perfect human introduction.
How stupid...
How teens feel.|Our cashless society.|Inconvenient but fun moments.
How the heck am I supposed to choose!?\nThose both sound amazing!
How the heck did you get all this way\nby yourself!?
How to make a curry roux from scratch. Most\npeople use store-bought products, yeah?
How to what?|You're really psyched up, huh?|Probably?
How unfortunate. I wanted you to observe your\nrole model for a little longer.
How was your destiny-blazing\nfortune reading?
How wonderful. An idol's smile is a fan's\ngreatest treasure.
How wonderful. Reading is the embodiment of\nintellectual desire.
How would that man feel to see a world where\nhis discovery has become common knowledge?
How would you like the "Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy\nSpaghetti"? Today's the last day for this\nlimited-time special!
How would you like to act as the\nPhantom Thieves' brain and chief strategist?
How!?
How'd you get here!? What were all the other\nsecurity guards doing!?
How'd you get in here!?
How'd you guess?|Not really, no.|Why would that be?
How'd you know it was us?
How'd you like a mouthful of lead!?
How're we supposed to gather info in\nthe Metaverse?
How's it going?
How's it going? Are you also here for\nsome coffee, {NAME2}?
How's it hangin', chief? Can you get me an\norder of fried rice?
How's that sound to you?
How's that sound? After we eat, want to go\nout for a run together?
How's the video doing?|Any reactions online?
How's this? Maybe a monochrome shot would\nsuit this scene.
How's this? Personally, I think it looks\ngreat.
How... unique.|I can't call you that...
Howdy do, {NAME1}-san! Yukimi-san asked me\nwhich day would be good for us to hang out.
Howdy there!
Howdy there! Do you like capsule toys?
Howdy there! Have you ever wanted to\ntry fishing?
Howdy there! Nice weather, huh? It's another\nperfect day here in Shibuya!
Howdy there, sugar!
Howdy! Everyone memorize the opening of\n"The Tale of the Heike"?
Howdy! So wonderful to see you again!
Howdy! Today we'll be covering Yoshida\nKenko's "Essays in Idleness"! I just love\nthese kinds of works.
Howdy! Today we'll be starting "The Tale of\nGenji," a true Japanese literature classic.
Howdy! Today, we're covering "The Tales of\nIse." Specifically one man's journey long,\nlong ago to the east!
Howdy, I'm Mr. Nagara, your literature\nteacher!
Howdy, everyone! Today we'll be covering\n"The Pillow Book."
However, I am not yet satisfied. So I shall\nask you another question.
However, I am worried for you, Naruru.
However, I can only bear to watch for\nso long.
However, I can sense some sort of power from\nthat imitation money... It might be\nadvantageous to collect it after all.
However, I can sense some sort of power\nfrom that imitation money... It might be\nadvantageous to collect them.
However, I can't remember what that spice\nwas called. Perhaps it was meant to simply\nbe a once-in-a-lifetime encounter...
However, I did notice that just before\nMiyazawa's Shadow disappeared it said, "They\ncut ties with me."
However, I feel my bond with\nMerope growing deeper...
However, I get the feeling that he's been\navoiding me ever since the incident.
However, I realize that I may have been the\nonly one having fun.
However, I sometimes think it'd be nice if\nI could fly in the Metaverse as well...
However, I still love flicking the pages by\nhand! And the smell of old books\nis wonderful!
However, I would like a safe place to stop\nand catch my breath if possible.
However, I'm pretty sure owls are exclusively\ncarnivorous... Is that correct?
However, addin' seasonings to taste could\nresult in a less high-quality dish.
However, as a disciplinary committee member,\nI cannot accept favors from teachers.
However, at this time, I have no choice but\nto rest and recover my power... So...\ntired...
However, each time you use one gives you\nthat much less to work with, so use\nthem wisely!
However, if she continues to be known\nas a Menace, the possibility of her\nbecoming a Palace ruler...
However, if the real Kiuchi doesn't think his Treasure can be stolen, it will not materialize in the Metaverse.
However, if you find ruin an unsavory fate...
However, it isn't usable right now.\nShall we investigate the area first?
However, it seems I must study further on\nhow to express emotion. At any rate, I hope\nyou will bear with me for this time.
However, it's now my biggest pastime.
However, let us set that aside for the time\nbeing. Learning a foreign language is one of\nthe best things you can do.
However, most of us today believe that\nit was because there are a lot of birds\non this island.
However, much about the Metaverse still\neludes me. Therefore, it is of critical\nimportance we learn more about it.
However, not just anyone can control what\nlies inside their heart.
However, pay me no mind. I would like you to\nthink of me as invisible if you so need.
However, sorting my returning memories,\nstudying the Metaverse... That is truthfully\nwhere I want to focus my efforts.
However, that does not mean the desires he stole from others will return to their rightful owners.
However, that was his intention. His\nprovocations sent her into a downward spiral.
However, there was one who indirectly\nresisted this inequality... Tch! You all look\nlike you're falling asleep.
However, this dam is still undergoing\nconsultation and lacks the proper security.
However, university taught me that it's different nowadays.
However, we'll have to put a pause on that plan for the moment...
However, we've only just begun our farming\njourney. We shouldn't aim too high just yet.
However, what I can discern from my most\nrecent recollections tells me that we ought to\nconsider our <color=#FF423F>next course of action</color>.
However, witnessing the true scope of your\npower was quite the boon.
However, your vitality, your influence...
However... Akashi's success stories almost\nalways revolve around a "villain."
However... you must never look inside.
Hrm, it doesn't look like there's\na mechanism.
Hrm, so taking out that box wasn't enough to\ntake out the power. We'll have to find more.
Hrm... I'd like to oblige you, I promise.
Hrm... It seems that we do indeed need to\nsteal the Palace's Core like before.
Hrmmm...
Hrmmm... I think this is the pick for good\nplum wine... It's got a better flavor...
Hrrrraaaaagh!
Hu... Ah... Haaa!
Hu\u2014 Uh\u2014 What?
Hubby said he'll be home early today, so I'll\nneed to get started right away!
Huh! It feels weird to meet other phantom\nthieves. It's reassuring to know that there\nare more of us out there.
Huh! Same as us, then.
Huh!?
Huh!? Ah!
Huh!? Are you sure...?
Huh!? Get back here!
Huh!? Haruna! Wait!
Huh!? Hold on, you must be intruders!
Huh!? How could you, Mr. Akashi!?
Huh!? I-I didn't mean right away...
Huh!? Kurotani-kun...
Huh!? No, that would be... You're joking,\nright? Very funny, {NAME1}-san.
Huh!? Nonsense! I can't accept without\noffering fair compensation!
Huh!? Oh, you're the guy from before...\nMy train pass!
Huh!? Oh... That's fine, but...
Huh!? These weren't some surprise you\nprepared for the broadcast, sir!?
Huh!? Uh, I mean I guess you can have\none bite.
Huh!? Um, thanks! Well, I'm glad you're\nhaving fun.
Huh!? Wait, what!? You mean we're being\nwatched here in the real world?
Huh!? We said we were gonna play a different\ngame today! We can't!
Huh!? Wh-What are you saying?
Huh!? Wha\u2014? Tanemura-san!? Where'd you all\ncome from!?
Huh!? What is that!?
Huh!? What'd you just say, brat!?
Huh!? Who are you!? Don't tell me you're those\nintruders that Kiuchi-sama warned us about!?
Huh!? Would that be okay?
Huh!? You can't just say that out of the blue!
Huh!? You want to play another game already?
Huh, I didn't expect that! Then how about you\ntell me all about them?
Huh, I was just about to say the same\nthing! You're not bad, lemur.
Huh, I was told good things about that clinic. Their prescriptions are apparently very effective.
Huh, I wonder why! Maybe there's some\nreason for it.
Huh, an interview? And... you want it\non video?
Huh, hang on a sec... Are you into her?
Huh, he's the kinda guy that's always talking to\nhimself when he's doing stuff? I do that.
Huh, imagine that.
Huh, maybe that's because I used some tonic\nwater instead of club soda?
Huh, okay then. I think you'll be just fine.
Huh, the Shadows are competing with\neach other?
Huh, well then, wanna just go hang out in Shibuya?
Huh, what are you talking about?
Huh, what happened? Why did we stop?
Huh, what...? Why's it staring at us like\nthat!?
Huh, why!?
Huh, you don't say?
Huh, you're giving this to me...?
Huh.
Huh. He's better than I thought.
Huh. I didn't expect him to know how to cook.
Huh. I'm curious how much of a help you\nactually end up being.
Huh. Is that a line formin' over there?
Huh. So this is what it looks like inside.
Huh...
Huh... Dad really told you all of that?
Huh... Did the enemy's movements slow down?
Huh... I hope you're right.
Huh... I'd never have guessed. I thought\neveryone knew by now.
Huh... Now that you mention it, maybe?
Huh... Smart people think about the\nweirdest things.
Huh... So, you can enjoy it that way, too.
Huh...!? I didn't say anything weird just\nnow, did I? Right!?
Huh...?
Huh...? 
Huh...? But putting in effort sounds like\nsuch a pain...
Huh...? Joker!?
Huh...? Why do you care?
Huh...? Your muscles are trying to tell me\nsomething... Are you familiar with Zoshigaya?
Huh?
Huh? "Making" them get corrupted?
Huh? "Taste"!? A taste of what!?
Huh? Ah! No freakin' way! It's gone!?
Huh? Ah! Sorry, sorry! Welcome!
Huh? Ah, no! Don't worry! It's not like a\nserious problem or anything.
Huh? Ah, well yes, I suppose it was.
Huh? Ahaha... Oops.
Huh? Are you all here on a tour? Sorry, you\ncame at a bad time...
Huh? Are you saying you've got a thing\nfor maids, {NAME2}-kun?
Huh? Aren't we just back where we came?
Huh? Beats me... We're clueless about all\nthat complicated stuff.
Huh? But it doesn't look like the walls are\ngonna come down on us.
Huh? But the guy's taken down entire restaurants with these reviews. That's a bad dude.
Huh? But, is that okay? What about the clinic?
Huh? But...
Huh? Can't it wait until after we're\ndone recording?
Huh? Collapsing...?
Huh? Did he just say it? He said it, right?
Huh? Did it drop something? Wait, is that\nthe <color=#FF423F>money</color> he was talking about?
Huh? Did it drop something? Wait, is that\nthe money he was talking about?
Huh? Did you get hurt!?
Huh? Do you feel sorry for him or something?\nAnyways, let's press the attack!
Huh? Do you two know her?
Huh? H-Here... we... GO!?
Huh? H-How do you know my name?
Huh? He's gone already...
Huh? Hold on... Who's that!?
Huh? How did you know?
Huh? I didn't say "do chores," I said to do\ncore training exercises!
Huh? I didn't see any there...
Huh? I don't remember it tasting like this.
Huh? I don't think all of us here have met\nbefore...
Huh? I just got this text from Tomoko. She\nsaid Kano-kun's not in the classroom.
Huh? I think we gave it a bit too much...\nI don't think it'll grow any bigger now.
Huh? I thought I deleted this.
Huh? I thought it was an 8? I remember it\nbeing kind of long...
Huh? I thought you said you did what\nyou could...
Huh? If somethin' like that were possible,\nI would've already...
Huh? If you wanna do it, go ahead.
Huh? Is that Suzui from the volleyball team?
Huh? Is this for me?
Huh? Isn't that Riko Tanemura\nin front of the camera over there?
Huh? It's Ayaka Sakai... Why do you ask?
Huh? It's a dead end!
Huh? It's a dead end?
Huh? It's not like we're talking about the\nprimary colors here! Never mind, I guess you\ndon't know.
Huh? Katayama's Shadow is acting strange.
Huh? Katayama-san was?
Huh? M-Me?
Huh? Maybe I missed something...
Huh? Miyazawa retired?
Huh? More <color=#FF423F>fake money</color>?
Huh? More fake money?
Huh? No way, do I really!?
Huh? O-Ohhh, the replacement we talked\nabout. Ummm, well, obviously things didn't\nwork out with the Food Fight, but...
Huh? Obviously she's on ours!
Huh? Oh no!
Huh? Oh! Thank you so much!
Huh? Oh, I get it! I'm sorry! Yeah, you'd\nstart feeling nervous!
Huh? Oh, Kano-kun!
Huh? Oh, don't worry about me.\nI'm in tip-top shape.
Huh? Oh, it's nothing!
Huh? Oh, maybe you're right. I'm probably\njust overthinking things.
Huh? Oh, right. They did say that was today.
Huh? Oh, sorry. I was just... remembering\nstuff.
Huh? Oh, sure. The theater is right past that\ncorner over\u2014
Huh? Oh, there's something funny about that\nShadow over there.
Huh? Oh, uh, right...
Huh? Oh, uh... Sure. She was beautiful, no\ndoubt.
Huh? Oh, well um... I don't know.
Huh? Oh, yeah. Right. Just call me <color=#FF423F>Skull</color>!
Huh? Oh, you're Narumi-chan's fans!
Huh? Oh, {NAME2}-kun! What's up? You helping Minami out again?
Huh? Oh. Right. OoOoOo!
Huh? Ohhh, was that her name?
Huh? Poor Mr. Akashi... Katayama really is a\nMenace. She's lost it.
Huh? Really!? You sure?
Huh? Riko-senpai?
Huh? Seriously? Maaan... I guess I'm still not used to fighting yet.
Huh? So there's no way to answer this one?
Huh? Someone from your band club told\nyou that?
Huh? Special? Wait, so, that means...
Huh? THIS is the Treasure?
Huh? Take-chan, what's this all about?
Huh? That door...
Huh? That place has been getting awful reviews lately. Look, one-stars across the board.
Huh? That thing over there...
Huh? That's him!?
Huh? The door's not opening.
Huh? The heck is this?
Huh? There's another video.
Huh? There's something on the monitor...
Huh? These questions are ridiculous.\nWhat's up with this?
Huh? They come in different flavors. It's\neither pork or miso for the base.
Huh? They got involved the moment they\nsided with you!
Huh? This feeling...
Huh? This whole shop only has books by a\nsingle publisher!
Huh? Tomoko, don't you have club today?
Huh? Uh, not yet...
Huh? Uh... Nothing, I'm cool! Haha...
Huh? Uh... What just happened?
Huh? Umm... It looks like a good harvest\nis in your future, but you may need to brave\na frightening path to claim it...
Huh? Waaaaagh!
Huh? Wait, Wonder? Is that you!?
Huh? Wait, for what?
Huh? Wait, you don't mean...
Huh? Wait... What happened to\nthe guys chasing you?
Huh? Wasn't the entrance to Akashi's Palace\nlocked? Why is it wide open?
Huh? Well, yeah.
Huh? Wha\u2014!? Ah!
Huh? Whaddya mean you've never been to Koshien!?
Huh? What do you mean?
Huh? What is this place?
Huh? What kind of place is this?
Huh? What the hell!?
Huh? What was that!?
Huh? What was that?
Huh? What're you talkin' about? There's...\nWait, this one's got no shield!
Huh? What're you talking about...
Huh? What's Mr. Hakozaki doing here?
Huh? What's everyone gathering for?
Huh? What's this app with the eye icon?
Huh? What's this? Did you make this?
Huh? What's wrong? Are you okay?
Huh? What's your problem! Get lost! It's my\nturn now!
Huh? Where did everyone go?
Huh? Where is it!?
Huh? Where's Tsurumi?
Huh? Who're you, kid?
Huh? Who? Did she retire or something?
Huh? Why do you ask?
Huh? Why!?
Huh? Why?
Huh? Will I remember the code?
Huh? Y-You're giving this to me? Really!?
Huh? You don't mean... Someone discovered our\nidentities and laid a trap for us!?
Huh? You need something?
Huh? You still think you're in a position\nto refuse?
Huh? You weren't listening?
Huh? You wish to tell him about that...?
Huh? You'll do it!? Yes! You're the best,\n{NAME2}! I'll go buy some pens and paper!
Huh? You'll help me?
Huh? You're going already?
Huh?|What does that mean?
Human desire comes in many shapes,\nso we had best not make assumptions.
Human, we're delighted to have you\nonboard. We hope you enjoy the Robo\nChallenge at full throttle!
Humanity's hopes, desires, motivations... are being stolen out from under your noses.
Humans can be such irrational and incoherent\ncreatures. Though I suppose desire behaves in\nmuch the same way.
Humans can't seem to get enough\nof this Mad Bull canned beverage.
Humans come into this world naked. Leaving it with even a pair of underwear\non is lucky. But it seems our vic has left with everything but his hat...
Humans could shed toes to speed up, too.
Humans have not correlated the two? Perhaps\nit is an unconscious behavior.
Humans kick off of their big toe to walk,\nputting almost no weight on their pinky toe.
Humans truly are compelling creatures.\nI look forward to learning more while I'm\nby your side.
Hup! Hah!
Hup! One, two... and three!
Hup! Then we do... this!
Hup! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Now, time for the\nfinisher!
Hup! Wait, what? That's not how it's supposed\nto go...
Hup, hup! Hah! One, two, three...
Hurray! I'm <color=#FF423F>Yaoling Li</color>.
Hurray! Thank you! All aboard for adventure,\nchoo choo!
Hurray! Thank you! Let's walk and talk.
Hurray! Thanks! I wanted to update you about\nthe Yukimi-san sitch as soon as I could.
Hurray! Thanks! Okay, let's get our walk and\ntalk on!
Hurry it up! Don't just favor the women!
Hurry up!
Hurry up! Put some money in this thing\nand get me out of here!
Hurry up...
Huuuh? I didn't quite catch that?
Huuuh? No way! But there's heaps of it!
Huuuh? One's missing...
Huuuuuh!?
Huuuuuuuuuh!?
Hwooooooaaaaaaah!
Hyaa!? Wh-What was that noise?
Hyped?|But why?
Hypothetically speaking... And I mean,\nhypothetically...
I SEE THE SEA!
I SEE THE SEA! Hehe!
I TOLD you!
I accept the flattery, but I refuse to be\ncompared to the likes of him.
I accept your challenge!|I'll get that prize!
I accidentally let Yui drag\nme into her antics...
I accidentally nodded off...
I achieved my dream in the end, but they've\nstill never approved...
I acknowledge your dedication to your...\nextra-curricular commitments, but take care\nnot to neglect your school life.
I acted like it was pointless engaging with\npeople who don't know about the films I love.
I actually have something I need to ask you\nabout. Do you have a minute?
I adjust the seasoning each day based on\nthe weather and temperature outside.
I admired the cop's guts for\nbuilding himself into the\nmuscular arm of the law...
I admired them so much, I aspired to be a\npassionate teacher like that. Someone who\nfaces their students head-on.
I admit I did not expect this change within\nmyself either.
I admit I never imagined this hall's entire\nfloor could be a trap...
I admit I've got a lot to learn too.
I agree completely.|Determining their cause?
I agree it's putting the cart before the\nhorse... but how are we to siege a\nsealed Palace?
I agree that Tanemura-kun is quite the\ntalent. She'll surely be a great help to you.
I agree with your sentiment, however, that\ntime for Riko has long since passed.
I agree! And who knows, maybe that's where\nJoker and the others are!
I agree! I'm getting fidgety just standing\naround here.
I agree. But this is the sort of knowledge we\nneed to work matters out between people.
I agree. Strength in numbers is the way to\ngo. Not to mention... thing's aren't looking\ngood for us.
I agree. We can't let Miyazawa go on\nlike this.
I agree.|I can't wait for the next one.
I agree.|I'm getting sick of this.
I agree.|You think so...?
I agreed to hang out\nwith Shun...
I agreed to hang out\nwith Tomiyama...
I agreed to hang\nwith Tomoko...
I agreed to help Motoha...
I agreed to meet up\nwith Yaoling...
I agreed to spend time\nwith Kurotani...
I agreed to talk with Haruna.
I aimed for a dish that has a tasty broth\nbut also tastes good even when not\npipin' hot.
I ain't a particularly stealthy guy...
I ain't gonna sit around and take it either.\nIt's 'cause of assholes like him that\ninnocent people like Pops end up suffering.
I already have an idea for my next song.
I already have evidence of the brat's\nassault! Have them take away his little friends\ntoo while they're at it!
I already knew you were super kind, but it's\ndifferent seeing it firsthand.
I already told you people. No one wants to\nsee your tearful coming-of-age drama.
I already told {NAME2}, but I am not going\nto expose myself like that again.
I also added the garnish on the brim of the\nglass. Layers really do help make a drink\npop.
I also felt the same, and I still do now. So if there's something you want to do, do it.
I also recommend adding lots of cabbage.\nMaking it from freshly-picked ingredients\nsounds super fun!
I also think having a solid rhythm would get\nthe point of the song across better.
I always get nervous when strangers\napproach me looking to start a\nconversation...
I always liked listening to music, but never\nimagined doing it myself.
I always see you hanging around with Arai\nthese days. Are you friends or something?
I always thought Motoha had nerves of steel\never since we were kids. I gave her a script\nto work with for today, but...
I always thought... I was the one to blame...
I always tried to be patient and\nunderstanding with him because of how rough\nmy relationship was with my parents.
I always wanted to say hi to you sometime,\nbut I never got the chance. Nice to meet you!
I always... dreamed of being a movie star.

I asked him about it, but he just said that\nit was his own fault.
I asked him to do a puzzle, and then he\nsaid he was going to cram school...
I asked what was going on,\nalthough I already knew it\nwas something petty...
I assume all of you who left it blank simply have no plans for the future.
I assumed a customer must have lost it, so\nI left it out in an easy-to-find spot.
I assumed it would be too soon for you to\ntake on my next assignment, but seeing as\nyou mastered the posing so skillfully...
I at least want to go with her to the hospital.

I believe Yaoling appreciates the finer\npoints of tea quite well.

I bet soccer training would make the perfect\nworkout plan for our operations.
I bet sprinting over there would really\ntake a load off your mind. C'mon!

I betcha wonderin' what all this is, huh?\nWell, I've already gone and done a thorough\ninspection for ya!
I better to hurry to school...
I booted up\nHarvest World Online.

I bought a kalimba a little while back just\nto try it out.
I bring fertility, and shall lead you to the\nfuture. This fruitful body shall now be\nyour mask.
I brought snacks!|Let's take a break.
I buy it from the school store.|Depends on the day.|I don't eat lunch.
I called the parents several times, but they\ndidn't answer, so I went to speak with them.
I came here all the time during my baseball\ndays. Working here is a first though.
I came here to look for inspiration today,\nbut I didn't expect it to be this much fun!
I came here to stop you. I warned you about\nsharing inflammatory videos, didn't I?
I came here to verify...
I came to see how you were doing.|I have plans today...
I can always whip up a mocktail! Drink with\nme when you're of age, okay?
I can barely stomach just one of him.\nThis is bad...
I can feel Lufel's\nintense enthusiasm...

I can just talk to you! Hehe.
I can keep going... Let's get Kiuchi and\u2014
I can keep going.|I'm burnt out.
I can miss one lousy practice!
I can no longer ignore your misconduct.\nIt brings shame to all of us fans.
I can now ascertain your true self without any reservations...
I can push them around, and they'll just cry themselves to sleep. And anyone who sees, they'll just pretend they didn't!
I can see us setting up a whole chain in the\nnot too distant future. I know old\n<color=#FF423F>Pops Yamagoshi-san</color> will be pleased!
I can see why you guessed that, but\nunfortunately, it means "one."
I can sense Lufel's faith\nin me...
I can sense Takayama from here...
I can sense Tomoko's\nearnest feelings.
I can sense Yamagoshi overflowing with hope.\nOf course this is a result of us changing\nMiyazawa's heart...
I can sense danger in the area ahead...\nBut, with danger also comes treasure...
I can sense the Palace ruler here too.\nLikely another cognition, but we should check.
I can sense the Treasure. It seems it's on\nthe <color=#FF423F>top floor</color> of that castle.
I can sense the desire throbbing within you!
I can show you to the station.|Follow me.
I can smell freshly baked rice crackers in\nthe air.
I can smell the Core... It's coming from\noutside!
I can still come to practice, and I'm sure it'll heal on its own by the game. So don't worry, okay?
I can tell this is the culmination of your\nresearch together and that you put a ton of\nthought into the flavors and textures.
I can tell you everything if you allow me to\n<color=#FF423F>read your fortune</color>!
I can tell you progressed by leaps and bounds!
I can tell you put a lot of thought\ninto this.

I can tell you've gained something of import.
I can tell. The timing's just too perfect.\nHe was so mad last time, you know?

I can tidy up myself, you know.|You're treating me like a baby...
I can use this time to\npractice solo or as a duo.
I can watch over you with ease.
I can't be giving you wrong information,\nafter all.
I can't believe I got a present from you!\nThanks so much! Ehehe...
I can't believe Ms. Katayama's suspended\nindefinitely...
I can't believe how fast that went by.
I can't believe it's this late...
I can't believe it,{NAME2}!\nYou're friends with a doctor!

I can't believe you hire someone to clean\nyour tiny apartment.
I can't believe you really jumped after me!\nDon't tell me... you're a mermaid, too!?
I can't decide what school I want to go to most...
I can't detect any distortion nearby...
I can't do this, I just can't...
I can't face her after everything I've done.\nHah...
I can't feel a thing! Unless you deal\n<color=#FF423F>continuous damage</color> in one turn, you'll\nnever win against me!
I can't get enough. I just want to see more\nof it.
I can't get it out of this\nmountain of garbage...
I can't get to your level with a little\npractice after quitting the game for so long.
I can't go back to my dream anymore, but if\nthere's any way I can help you return to\nyours, I...!
I can't hear most of what they say, but I'm\nsure I've heard them use slang words.
I can't help but feel proud\nabout my singing...
I can't help but get excited when my favorite\nChinese tea is in the mix.
I can't help but smile at the\ntaste of these strange\nnew flavors.
I can't help but wonder about what they'd be like!\nBut I guess it'd be best not to ask too much...
I can't help you the way I am now.
I can't ignore the fact that I'm part of the reason things turned out this way.
I can't just leave him to fend for himself!
I can't let him spread that fake soup around\nthe country under Pops's name!
I can't let you do all the work, Russet!
I can't make tails or heads of how to\nfigure out which to use...
I can't offer much in return except juice and soda, but the kids and I would love it.
I can't play drums and the guitar at the\nsame time...
I can't really recall why...\nBut I feel like I somehow\nknow this place...
I can't say I fully understand myself. If\npushed, I suppose I'd call it... fate.
I can't say I recommend it... But maybe\nthere's a lesson to learn in there somewhere?
I can't say I was late because I lost\ncompany data, so I'll say it was for\npersonal reasons.
I can't say for certain one way or the other, but there is a non-zero possibility.
I can't say for certain since the post was\nanonymous, but it's highly plausible.
I can't say for sure just how much this has\naffected Kotone-san...
I can't say for sure.
I can't say it's the most dignified hobby.
I can't say that out loud...
I can't see! Where... Where are theeeey!?
I can't seem to find anywhere that sells loose leaf tea... I'm still not used to reading Japanese either...
I can't seem to stop thinking of things I\nwant to sing when I'm with you...
I can't simply walk into a restaurant in my\nowl form. Do get some juicy takeout for me.
I can't spot any, though. It seems that they\nmust be hiding.
I can't spot anything resembling\nan electrical box nearby, either.
I can't stand lying to our customers like this...
I can't stand to cause trouble for everyone\nanymore. I'll stay and take full\nresponsibility for this.
I can't stop eatin' it!
I can't take all the credit.\nRiko-senpai wrote the script for me!
I can't take it anymore!
I can't tell where he's\nlooking with those\nsunglasses on...
I can't tell you that either.
I can't thank you enough!
I can't thank you enough. This is what all of\nour hangin' out has led to.
I can't use money in the real world, so I'd\ngive it to you as a gift, Panther!
I can't wait to hang out with Kotone-san! I'd\nbetter start thinking of places for us to go\ntogether.
I can't wait to see what we can create\nnext time.
I can't wait to taste-test.|Why the sudden sweet tooth?
I can't wait to try it!|Looks delicious.
I can't yet predict what it might do.\nLet's explore with caution.
I can't, for the life of me, come up with the\nright gift to give to a friend.
I can't.
I can't. I'm being called to another table...
I can't... I have to get to cram school.
I cannot be certain... This has never\nhappened before.
I cannot deny your claim, but I believe this\ntoo is a win-win situation.
I cannot sense what lies ahead. It's also\nrisky with one person unable to fight.
I care little for what it's called. The\nquestion is... what exactly is this place?
I carefully bring the glass to\nmy lips for a taste...
I carry a drink, obviously, but it's still\nnice to know there are water fountains\nnearby just in case.
I certainly am.
I certainly have no intention of forcing you into it.
I changed clothes and\nleft the store.
I chatted with Ritsuka as we\nwalked to the station.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. He gave me the\nrundown on the new stock.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. I decided to treat\nhim today.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. We nabbed stuff\nthat's usually out of stock.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. We observed what\nwas popular before buying.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. We were hungry and\nended up buying way too much.
I choose what to read based on what the\nbook is about.
I choose you, {PLAYER_NAME}-san!
I closed my eyes for a second\nand accidentally fell asleep...
I collect pennants, you know. I wonder if\nthey sell one for this place?
I collected my pay.
I combined all my favorite dance moves to\nmake my own signature flair.
I come around here quite a bit. Perhaps we'll\nmeet again.
I come down to Yongen-Jaya a lot. The theater\nhere shows old movies sometimes.
I come from Sichuan, which is famous for\nmaking a strong alcoholic drink called\nbaijiu.
I come from within you to fight for you...
I come here a lot running errands for my mom!
I come here whenever I feel down.
I commend the strength of her desire to lure us in, but I suggest we keep moving.
I concentrated on\nwashing dishes...
I concur. I sense it as well. Let's head in\nthat direction.
I concur. Let's make our way there.
I concur. Some may appear more on the\ncute side when compared to my stately\nappearance.
I concur. We must neutralize the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> to\nprevent the shield from coming back.
I concur. Well, that gives us a\nunanimous decision.
I considered how to use my\n<sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Dexterity</color> to be even more\nefficient next time.
I convinced myself that you didn't really\ncare, and treated you coldly because of it.
I coughed a bit at first, but\nit actually tastes\npretty mild...
I could cook if I\nhad ingredients...
I could do with a bite to eat.|Sorry, got places to be.
I could do with a drink.|I have plans today...
I could eat.|I can't make it today.
I could even use fruit juice for the ice\ncubes or something!
I could feel the young\nsamurai's bravery amidst the\ntense psychological warfare...
I could get a whole new outfit too. I'm sure\nit'd be a huge hit!
I could go by Deadcattle instead...\nNo, never mind. That is too ominous.
I could learn a thing or two from them...
I could make my return at any time,\nand yet...
I could never forget what it felt like to see\nan audience listen to my voice like that.
I could only do simple flair tricks back\nthen, so he'd always complain about that.
I could say thank you a thousand times and it\nstill wouldn't feel like enough.
I could see the sparkle in their eyes! They\nwere really cute, actually!
I could tell you're a true Shibuya devotee!\nI'm so happy... *sniff* It brings a tear\nto my eye...
I could...never do that!
I couldn't believe it when I got the hospital call. Critical condition and unconscious.
I couldn't care in the least.
I couldn't do it, but I'm sure you have what\nit takes to be great.
I couldn't even begin to imagine what kinds\nof complications would lead to that.
I couldn't face the truth... That I was a\nfake... That I threw away my pride as\nan actor...
I couldn't get a permit for today, so I can't\nplay music here after all.
I couldn't have asked for a better diversion.\nI feel so much lighter now.
I couldn't help but cheer for\nSpicy-Man as he boldly\nslurped up those noodles.
I couldn't make anything go right... Then I started doing something that awful...
I couldn't say. In fact, I'd like to know the\nanswer to that myself.
I couldn't think of anything, so I just wrote "N/A."
I couldn't think of anywhere else to train my\nreflexes other than the batting cages.
I curious as to what's on the other side\nof that ventilation shaft. Why don't we try\ntaking a look?
I dealt with the potato moles\nswiftly by myself. Looks like\nthe damage wasn't too bad.
I decided not to interfere...
I decided to accept\nher invitation.
I decided to go and meet\nwith Matsukata...
I decided to go exploring\nwith Haruna and her friends.
I decided to go look for him.
I decided to leave and not\nget in her way...
I decided to leave so I don't\nget in their way...
I decided to leave the area.
I decided to listen to \nShota's troubles...
I decided to log on and\ncheck on our land.
I decided to log on to\nHarvest World Online.
I decided to pass.
I decided to take the stamp\nand keep going.
I decided to take\nthe challenge.
I decided to tell her that her\ndad was worried about her...
I decided to tell her\nwhat I thought.
I decided to wait for\nthe woman to come\nback out of the office...
I declare this contestant utterly defeated!
I decorate my home with them, or place them\nby the entrance to the skating rink...
I despise myself for being this way. It's the reason I keep escaping to this hole at night like this.
I did a little research on Mr. Akashi.\nIt seems he used to work as a\nbusiness consultant.
I did bring my guitar, but just because it\nhelps me feel calm.
I did crop it so that guy wasn't in the\nshot, but when I went to post it...
I did it! A perfect copy!
I did it! I scored 100 points!
I did it, {NAME2}! Still can't believe it...
I did play it once, so there are some parts\nI remember, but...
I did promise to give you a reward, but it's\ngetting late, so I'll give it to you\ntomorrow. That okay with you?
I did say it was hard, to be fair.\nBut one oku is one hundred million.
I did the thing!
I did think over what I want to say to Dad before this.
I did! I think it came from up ahead!
I did. Once, maybe? I don't really remember.
I didn't agree to this.|Don't fly off after that bombshell!
I didn't buy this one...
I didn't care about getting in shape or\nanything back then. I just wanted to have fun\nand make friends.
I didn't catch all of that, but essentially\nthere's an item in the safe at Victory\nKitchen we can use to help Kano?
I didn't come here to sell anything, silly.\nI came to offer you some humble guidance!
I didn't do anything special.|All I did was listen.
I didn't do it because I felt guilty or\nanything. And that's why I feel so bad\nabout it now...
I didn't even get anything to thank your\nparents for having me over!
I didn't fail! I made it just over the mark!
I didn't have time to examine everything,\nbut I found several photos and videos\nof Ms. Katayama.
I didn't know about all that.|You shouldn't drink too much.
I didn't learn this until college, actually.
I didn't plan on it, but I guess we are.
I didn't pull off a performance, but having\nyou here did make me feel better.
I didn't really know what to do with myself... For a while I really lost the will to go on...
I didn't say we will win. I said we "could."
I didn't tell them the details, but knowing\nit was for you was more then enough to\nconvince\u2014
I didn't think anyone was listening!\nGod, that's embarrassing...
I didn't think there were Persona-users\nout there besides our group.\nThat's quite the surprise.
I didn't think you'd have the guts to face me willingly, Motoha Arai.
I didn't trust a second year with no musical\nexperience suddenly joining our club.
I didn't understand anything about the\ncompetition theme or the food consultant.
I didn't want to be the one getting hurt\nanymore, so I decided to hurt them first.
I didn't want to end it by just beating him\nup... I wanted to understand where he was\ncoming from before changing his heart.
I didn't win.
I didn't.|Just a little.|I'd risk it for you.
I diligently listened\nto the lecture...
I do aim for this to be a mutually beneficial\narrangement. A win-win, as you call it.
I do apologize for my uninvited arrival.
I do apologize for the short notice, but I\nask that you accompany me.
I do apologize for the short notice, but I\nhope that you will accompany me.
I do appreciate your directness, but please\nreconsider.
I do end up reading every book by certain\nauthors, though.
I do feel like I can say things I usually wouldn't when I'm talking to you, too.
I do feel more determined...\nProbably since my desires\naren't being stolen anymore.
I do feel that we're really starting to live up to the Phantom Thieves' name.
I do get that from time to time, yes...
I do have some idea of what could be the\nmatter...
I do hope that I have your cooperation.
I do kinda feel like I could do anything\nright now...
I do like the beach too, but I was more in\nthe mood for something like this today.
I do love to get out and stretch my wings...\nAnd I mean that literally, of course! Hoohoo.
I do not mind. More importantly, I'd like a\nphoto with you, Naruru.
I do not push her in the least. I support\nwhat she wants to do.
I do not talk like that!
I do sometimes think I'd like to try\nRen's coffee, but...
I do still want to be a nurse. A nurse like mom.
I do think I figured one thing out though.
I do think it might make a fun story to try\na weird one, but I never go through with it.
I do think you're more of a Red Ranger than\nanything else.
I do want that ramen!
I do worry whether its construction incited\nthe wrath of the gods, but...
I do!|I'm not interested.
I do, that's who! After all the money my\nfolks shelled out for this, I have to!
I do. What for? The usual?
I do.|Not exactly...|What's that?
I do.|Not so much.
I do.|Sometimes I wonder...|I guess we'll find out.
I don't believe he said to simmer it\nright away.
I don't believe that's right.
I don't believe you have anything to worry\nabout, but still... I would advise caution.
I don't blame you, sir. I blame the company's\npolicies that treat people like machines.
I don't care how you feel about it.
I don't care if people lie to me, mock me,\ninsult me, stalk me, whatever!
I don't care what form it takes... I just\nwant baseball in my life again.
I don't come here much, but it's so nice\neating out in the fresh air!
I don't even know how to\ndescribe the expression\non my face...
I don't even know where start!
I don't even know where to look. At this\nrate, I'm willing to take the next person\nwho walks by.
I don't get many opportunities to converse with young people. I apologize if my mannerisms seem strange.
I don't get much allowance, but I don't want to have to work after school either...
I don't get why someone she hates enough to\nthrow hands with would be the symbol that\nprotects her heart.
I don't have a single music friend right now,\nso I'd love to chat sometime...
I don't have anything I need\nto do this way... I should\nhurry home.
I don't have the skills to create an entire\nsong on my own.
I don't have work today, so I don't mind if\nit's a bit out of the way.
I don't know about baby castellas, but I\nthink Japanese tea would go best with the\nother snacks.
I don't know about that. You lose your\nmemory of this place once you leave,\nremember?
I don't know about you, but I really enjoy\nthe vibe of underground malls.
I don't know all of the details either... But\nher mother says stuff that makes her cry.\nThat's not right.
I don't know but we managed to acquire our\nfirst chain. Let us search for the others.
I don't know how I can ever make it up to\nthem, but I want to make everything right...
I don't know if I can get any of the answers\nright, but I guess I should try. I owe her\nafter all.
I don't know if a place like this is your\nkind of thing, but at any rate, today's all\non me.
I don't know if it's true, but I'd buy it.\nSome people do call marriage a gamble,\nafter all.
I don't know if that was the reason, but after that Miyazawa gave us terrible reviews, and the shop's been suffering ever since.
I don't know if that's what she really wants.\nIt might even end up bothering her.
I don't know if what you said was useful,\nbut I can see that my situation isn't so bad.
I don't know much about art supplies. Are\nthey pretty expensive?
I don't know what you're talkin' about,\nbut it's attacking!
I don't know whether he's obsessing over some\npast glory days or what, but he appears to\nhave an abnormal fixation on baseball.
I don't know whether you're still interested\nin being a Phantom Thief... but I assume you\ndon't mind if I still stay the night?
I don't know why such a presence would\nreappear, but we must investigate at once.
I don't know! I guess 'cause of what we talked about before, now this!
I don't know! Was he on the team before!?
I don't know, either. But maybe...
I don't know.
I don't know. It's kinda pointless,\ndon't you think?
I don't know... I find myself not wanting to\ninterfere because they're just too adorable.
I don't know... I've always had terrible\nluck, and I feel like my choices are\nalways wrong.
I don't know... The police clearly won't\nhelp, and I don't have the physical strength\nto stop him on my own.
I don't know... The setup seems like a\nbother... Plus, I'd have to hire a part-timer\nfor delivery.
I don't mind hard work, either! I'm stronger\nthan I look!
I don't mind the work.
I don't mind, but are you sure?|You're anxious about it?|Has your injury healed?
I don't mind.
I don't mind.|I got your back.
I don't need nuanced responses. Just tell me\nif you think it's good or not.
I don't need you to help me here. You don't need to force yourself!
I don't need your address or phone number\nor anything! Just your name.
I don't often feel down in the dumps, but\nwhen I do...
I don't really get it, but I guess that's\njust how it is...
I don't really get it, but wow! You really\nknow a lot!
I don't really get what all that means, but\nwhat kind of Shadow was it?
I don't really get what an \nconsultant does, but he seems\nlike an interesting guy.
I don't really get what's going on here, but\nI don't feel like she's out to cause trouble\nfor us.
I don't really get what's going on here,\nbut I don't feel like she's out to cause\ntrouble for us.
I don't really have a choice... He docks\nmy wages if I can't get a signature...
I don't really have time...|Seems like a lot to remember.
I don't really know any other places to play\naround here. Would you happen to have any\nideas, {NAME1}-kun?
I don't remember...|Sounds familiar...
I don't require a medical examination!
I don't see Kurosawa\nanywhere... Where could he\nhave gone?
I don't see a way for us to go underground.
I don't see any other exits.
I don't see the issue here. Your parents are overseas, are they not?
I don't see what sets these wares above\nthose available at other shops... except\nthe prices.
I don't sense any malicious intent, but...\nwhat precisely is your objective here?
I don't sense one bit of hostility from\nthem. This is quite the conundrum.
I don't think I can take much more than this.\nSorry, I'll have to call it a day.
I don't think I could explain it succinctly.
I don't think I could take it...
I don't think I could've done this on\nmy own...
I don't think I ever thought about why it's\nimportant to study other cultures.
I don't think I need to ask this but... that was all an act, right?
I don't think I've ever\nlooked at the sky\nlike this before...
I don't think he's going to put up with bad\ntreatment from his friends anymore. So that's\na relief.
I don't think it is. Wanna give it a try?\nOh, wait. Might be a bit risky to do here.
I don't think it would've gone so smoothly\nwithout your help, {NAME1}-kun.
I don't think it's broken. Might just be a light sprain.
I don't think one day is enough to try out\neverything!
I don't think she's going to\nlet this go...
I don't think so. If anything, she seems\nworried about us.
I don't think so. These questions were\nwritten by adults, okay? And plenty of other\npeople got that stamp.
I don't think so.|That seemed normal enough.
I don't think that jerk would allow anyone\nto paint over his portrait like that...
I don't think that's a good idea... At least\nbe careful about it!
I don't think that's it. Let's think again.\nIt's a choco banana cr\xeape...
I don't think that's it... Hang on a sec,\nare we assuming a person made this?
I don't think that's it.|It's probably thanks to you.
I don't think that's what Taiko's worried\nabout.
I don't think that's why...
I don't think the high-pressure vibe\nsuits me.
I don't think there are any more books in this\narea. Let's go somewhere else!
I don't think they'd have ever listened to\njust us.
I don't think we can get through right now.\nWe ought to try something else.
I don't think we can grow them on our farm.
I don't think we would've made it through the\nday if you hadn't come by to help out.
I don't think we'll get in that easily...\nLet's come back later, Wonder.
I don't think we've checked the basement yet.\nLet's look for a way down there.
I don't understand.|What's stopping your comeback then?
I don't wanna die...
I don't wanna have to keep calling it that.\nHow about we give it a name?
I don't wanna wooork... There's gotta be a\nsuper easy job somewhere, right?
I don't want Kotone-san to feel the pain of\nbeing unable to return to what you love....
I don't want anyone calling me that,\nespecially not some fake feline!
I don't want everyone thinkin' this place has\nsome nosy creep runnin' it.
I don't want that either.|So life should be more colorful?
I don't want them thinking I'm some kind of bad influence on you all.
I don't want to assume, but...
I don't want to become a miserable old wretch\nwho has no motivation to do anything.
I don't want to leave...
I don't want to screw up my first impression\nand make them think I'm an antisocial weirdo.
I don't want us wasting anyone's time. Let's just see what he can do already.
I don't want you to take this the wrong\nway...
I don't want... to lose... myself. I will\nnever... betray... my students.
I don't want...to hurt you!
I dont have the customer's\nphone number...
I doubt he'll take it well...
I doubt we'll be able to return once we board\nthe elevator. Are you ready to go?
I dug into Shiina's impromptu\npasta while nursing\nthe mocktail.
I dunno about you, but when I hear\n"old-fashioned ramen," this is what comes\nto mind.
I dunno if my phone has the space...
I dunno...  I'd rather go somewhere else,\nif that's okay? Sorry.
I dunno... There was something weirdly real\nabout the way Miyazawa talked about it.
I end up making him feel worse when I'm trying to help him. It's ridiculous, isn't it!
I ended up agreeing to play\na card game with them...
I ended up on\nKurosawa's team...
I ended up posting the uncropped version\nby mistake.
I ended up talking with him\nabout yakitori for a while.
I ended up waiting outside\nfor Kamiyama...
I enjoy daikon radish in oden or paired with\nmiso, but one day I'd like to try\npickled takuan.
I enjoy speaking with you because you see\ndepths that I cannot...
I enjoyed aimless banter with Komatsu.
I enjoyed aimless banter\nwith Komatsu...
I enjoyed singing karaoke\non my own.
I entered\nHarvest World Online.
I envy you, I admit. Figure skaters are all\nalone during their routines.
I envy you, if that's the worst you could\nthink of.
I escorted Motoha home.
I even looked in the prep room and it\nwasn't there either...
I even promised myself I'd eat the same meals\non my cheat days!
I even talk tougher now. I needed to have\nthick skin to be taken seriously in the\nmale-dominated sports world.
I even thought maybe she could help me with\nthe song I'm working on...
I eventually introduced\nmyself.
I exchanged numbers with the\nold man...
I expected a typical tiresome love triangle,\nbut she ended up becoming best friends with\nher beloved's ex-fiance...
I explained as best I could,\nbut it still came out vague.
I explained that everyone\nbailed on cleanup duty.
I explained that the diner was\ngiving away stamps even if you\ncouldn't solve the puzzle.
I explained the ones I know\nas simply as I could.
I explained the problem with\nhow the puzzle was written.
I explained the situation and\nthe store clerk let me\ntake it.
I explained the situation and\nthe store clerk let me\ntake the treasure.
I explained there was\na problem with the puzzle.
I explored Shibuya with\nHaruna and Shota.
I explored Shibuya with\nHaruna and her friends.
I faced her and told her everything I'd been holding back!
I fear I may lose control if my mind drifts\nfor even a moment.
I fear my presence could risk unmasking your identity as a phantom thief.
I feed on dumbshits like you...
I feel I must try it at least once. I'm\nhappy to have made it to the shop without\nissue but...
I feel I now understand you better. As your\nconcierge, I am truly grateful.
I feel a bit better now. Well, that's all I\nwanted to say. Later, Sensei...
I feel a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Merope...
I feel a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Motoha...

I feel a strong bond between\nme and Yui...

I feel almost unburdened when we talk. Like\nsome weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
I feel an air of dread...\nSomething terribly disturbing.
I feel as though I'm still a bit lacking in\ncomposure to be called a gentleman now...
I feel as though I've gained\nmore confidence in\nfacing enemies...
I feel as though Mementos is a bit less\nwarped than before.
I feel as though something is\napproaching us...
I feel bad for her.|Nothing in particular.
I feel bad for putting you out...|Well, if you insist!
I feel bad, but I'm the only one who can make\nmy muscles happy...
I feel empowered.|That's an overstatement.|How should I spend my paycheck?
I feel fine now. It's not every day I see you bring friends here. Least lemme say hello.
I feel it! My power's building up!\nSay your prayers!
I feel it... The Treasure is here.
I feel it... the anger coursing through\nme...!
I feel like I always get more done when\nyou're here. I hope we get to work\ntogether again!
I feel like I can express my thoughts and\nfeelings without putting up a front.
I feel like I can face anything when you're\nwith me, {NAME1}-kun.
I feel like I can handle anything with\nyou around.
I feel like I can't leave\nKurotani to act on his own.
I feel like I can't pick a place to eat\nwithout checking the reviews first.
I feel like I get the theme. I mean, what's\nnot to love about ramen? But how would I\nspice it up?
I feel like I should remember that, but...\nI don't. What about you?
I feel like I'd get a great\nworkout in by going to\nthe gym in Shibuya today...
I feel like I'd get even more\nthan usual out of going\nto the bathhouse today...
I feel like I'm gonna burp up for days.\nI tried drinking a whole soda in one go earlier...
I feel like I've already gone\nsomewhere today... I just\ncan't remember where.
I feel like I've come so far in my recovery\nthanks to you.
I feel like I've heard this\nconversation somewhere\nbefore...
I feel like I've matured\na bit...
I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...

I feel like a plant that's just been watered\nafter a long time!
I feel like a whole new world has opened up\nfor me.
I feel like dancing all night! Wanna join me?\nHaha, just messing around!
I feel like every time I want to do\nsomething, I don't feel like doing it\na minute later.
I feel like if I go now, I can do it.
I feel like in Japan, the word "maid" has\na very strong image associated with it.
I feel like it was 6...|My money's on 7.
I feel like it'd do me some good to shake\nthings up from time to time. Y'know, cook\nsomethin' unrelated to ramen.
I feel like it's pretty easy since it just\nrolls off the tongue so wonderfully!
I feel like maybe it wasn't as frustrating\nlosing this time compared to back then. It's\nalmost like I'm over it.
I feel like more people are taking note of\nShichi-kun these days.
I feel like my <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>\nhas improved.
I feel like my next dream is right around the\ncorner.
I feel like people will be disappointed with\nsomething so plain-looking.
I feel like taking it easy indoors today, though.\nKnow any good places?
I feel like that was the wrong answer.
I feel like there's something\nI forgot to do...
I feel like watching a movie\nat the theater would be even\nmore moving than usual today.
I feel like you're really enjoying yourself\nas a member of our club, {NAME1}-kun.
I feel my bond with Ayaka\ngrowing deeper...
I feel my bond with Kurotani\ngrowing deeper...

I feel someone staring at me...
I feel something on\nmy forehead...
I feel something pecking\nat my forehead....
I feel terrible for Masa and Shun... There's\njust nothin' else I can do about it...
I feel that Riko-san is under excessive\npressure as Umetane's successor.
I feel that contemplating the vastness of\nthe starry sky like this has been a very\nmeaningful use of time.
I feel the same.
I feel the same.|It's probably in your head.
I feel there may be clues nearby...
I feel ya. It's giving me some bad vibes too.\nAnd I'm not just talking about how it looks.
I fell on a bunch once... The smell got\nall over me. I couldn't bear taking\nthe train like that.
I felt eyes on us just now...
I felt our team members unite\nin determination before the\ncoming match.
I felt the same when I tried the ramen in\nOgikubo, but I think character is key here.
I fended off every last\npotato mole alone like\na true badass.
I figured it'd be better to know what he\nlooks like, so I asked him to send me a pic\nvia MMS...
I figured it's probably hard for you to eat noodles, Lufel, so I made sure to get lots of toppings suitable for pecking.
I figured out how to optimize\ncrafting infiltration tools.
I figured you'd be showing up soon.
I figured. Let's go!
I finally finished it...!
I finally found it...
I finally managed to sing for someone on\nmy own. Performing really does feel good!
I find it difficult to relax under\nsuch circumstances.
I find it hard to believe that a such\na highly fortified stronghold would just\nwelcome thieves inside.
I find myself thinking, "Why exactly did I\ncome here?"
I find the plot of this movie vexing. Perhaps\nbecause mortal desires are mysterious and\nunfathomable to me...
I find you especially suspicious, little lady.
I finished somehow!
I finished taking photos of\nthe stand. I should go \ntell Tanzo...
I finished the puzzles for Shota-kun!

I gave it my all. I think my cocktail turned\nout pretty good too.
I gave my name and class...
I gave the staff my name.
I gave the woman a lot\nof advice, including what\nto do about Anderson...
I gave up and accepted the fact that I'll\nalways be busy at this job, but dealing with\nparent calls is a serious pain.
I gave you all those pointers only to whiff\nmyself. I'm so pathetic. Ahaha...
I gazed at the streets\nof Zoshigaya until Minami\nregained her composure...
I get a bad feeling that someone's trying to\nexpose Shichi-kun's true identity.
I get a little nervous whenever I talk to\npeople at work about sports.
I get all nitpicky about savory dishes. The\nsource of the ingredients, the way they're\ncut, and stuff like that...
I get along with them fine now, but I guess\nI was kind of a reckless kid.
I get it now...
I get it, though. Don't we still turn to\nthe divine for help as a last resort?
I get it.
I get it... I wanted to see her standing on the stage one day too.
I get it...|Take a chill pill.
I get lost! Just like I did today. Ahahaha!
I get lots of flower bouquets from my fans\nat the end of a competition.
I get so stressed about missing out on a\ngreat meal or getting a bad one, I\nhave to check.
I get that it must clear her head, but\nterrorizing the neighborhood is not\nso great, huh...
I get that. Gotta switch it up every now\nand then.
I get the feeling he won't\nlet this go until I ask\nhim something...
I get the feeling there's a change awaiting\nme near the station... You'll come with\nme, right?
I get the impression that much of the\nback-and-forth is improv...
I get to work with you today!
I get what you mean, but the problem is, what\ndo we actually do now?
I get what you mean.|It's become a staple combo.
I get what you're saying.|I think I understand.
I get where you're coming from, but you're\nher daughter.

I knew it! There's a <color=#FF423F>treasure chest</color> in here!
I knew it'd be best to have a young man like\nyou teach me the words of your generation.
I knew it. It's that kid with the owl... But\nwhat are they doing going into a bar?
I knew it. Still, thanks for carrying it all\nthe way here.
I knew it...
I knew security was a little thin...
I knew that Kayo-san was worrying about me,\nbut I thought I didn't have time to care.
I knew that if worst came to worst, you'd be\nthere to back me up, {NAME1}-san.
I knew that wasn't actually true... But in\nthat moment, it was.
I knew that.|I didn't know that.
I knew there was a hidden passage here!
I knew this would surpass your\nunderstanding. Now listen up, kiddies.
I knew you could do it!
I knew you were the one.
I knew you weren't listening! Can't even\ncount on students to pay attention in\nclass anymore...
I knew you would say as much.
I knew you would understand. Con caf\xe9 idols\nare indisputably sophisticated.
I know I can't avoid it, but I'm really not\ngood with people.
I know I can't be dependent on you forever.\nI know that. It's just...
I know I chose to watch this, but now I wish I hadn't.
I know I decided to stop ignoring my self and my desires, but...
I know I just called you out here, but do\nyou mind if I rest for a bit?
I know I said before that I don't fully\nunderstand friendship...
I know I should stop Mona-chan and Cattle\nfrom bickering, but...
I know I won't be at Tamayo's level anytime\nsoon... But I'm gonna work my butt off to get\nthere!
I know I'll be able to sing from now on,\neven on my own.
I know I'm being childish and acting like a\nbig buttinski here, but...
I know I'm pretty great, but I'm not that perfect!
I know I'm talkin' like I'm gonna do this on\nmy own, but I'll need your help with this.
I know I'm the one who requested the\ndocuments, but this workload hardly seems\nreasonable for a single student.
I know I've said this already, but I can't\nbelieve you have a Persona too, Senpai!
I know Taiko already said this, but...
I know a really pretty area with benches,\ntoo. It's my favorite spot.
I know fluorescent lightbulbs, but what the\nheck are "incandescent" ones? I've never even\nseen those at the store.
I know he mentioned he'll be around campus\nstarting tomorrow, and encouraged you all\nto come speak with him, but...
I know he'll solve all of these for sure.
I know his name! He's an ex-baseball...
I know how it feels to be going through\na lot, you know? So I had to reach out.
I know how she feels. It's not like there's anything to live for.
I know how you feel.|I'd like to share someday.
I know how you men are about going\nto the doctor. My hubby just hates it.
I know idols rely on their fans' financial\nsupport, but...
I know it ain't real cash, but I feel kinda\nbad for him.
I know it isn't true... In my mind, I know.\nThe problem is my heart.
I know it might be disrespectful to enter\nthis competition when I'm not trying\nto win...
I know it sounds kinda hard to believe when\nyou lay it all out like that...
I know it would be troublesome to suddenly\nask you to go to another town to search\nfor treasure.
I know it's a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm\nsure they must exist, right?
I know it's a broadcasting tower, but it's\nabout as tall as the skyscrapers in Shanghai.
I know it's hard to hear, but it's better to just avoid people like that in the first place.
I know it's harder for women to go pro, so I\nstrived to get stronger.
I know my apology can't possibly make up\nfor all I've done...
I know my dad cares a lot about me.
I know rehab is really hard when you're going\nthrough it, but it'll be over before you\u2014
I know she might seem a little stiff at first\nglance, but I've seen how kind she is.
I know she's not one to say something like\nthat, but still, I do feel like a failure...
I know that guy.
I know that place! Yongen, right?
I know that's rare these days.
I know that, and I get that it isn't going to\nchange, but it's hard on a student budget.
I know the feeling.|You prefer happy endings?
I know the owner. Come on in.
I know the rumor.|First I've heard of it.
I know there isn't any real reason why I\nshouldn't play baseball anymore.
I know these two act like they don't get\nalong, but I think they make a good duo, no?
I know they probably look like bad guys to\nthe two of you.
I know they're just numbers, but c'mon,\nthat's pretty neat, right? It's another reason\nwhy I love math.
I know this Shadow!|Is this the one from before!?
I know this is a bit out of nowhere, but do\nyou read much, {NAME1}-san?
I know this isn't something people normally\nsay in real life, but could you promise me\nsomething?
I know this title may be a little difficult\nfor you to understand...
I know we were just battling together and\nall, but seriously, the hell's with\nthis blowhard?
I know we're in the middle of an important discussion, but... shall we dig in?
I know what I have to do. I was so laser\nfocused on beating Tamayo that I couldn't\nthink straight.
I know what I said to Kiuchi. But the truth\nis... I still feel something holding me back.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean. She has that unapproachable kind of beauty.
I know what you must be thinking. You\nalready put your lives at risk once, and here\nI am asking you to do it six more times.
I know what you're gonna say, so spare me.\nI'm not backing down.
I know what you're gonna say.
I know why you're here.
I know you all have critiques to make, but\nwe're not here to workshop Miyazawa's script.
I know you can do better than that! Let me\nsee your budding potential!
I know you can do it.|Let's both give it our best.
I know you can do it.|You time will come.
I know you can.|I'm looking forward to it!
I know you could be right,\nbut I really don't wanna believe it.
I know you did.|Can't say for sure.|Let's have faith.
I know you don't see lotus seeds used in\nJapanese sweets very often, but they're used\nas a paste in Chinese sweets regularly.
I know you have not forgotten. We are meant\nto visit the concept caf\xe9, or "con caf\xe9,"\nif you will.
I know you just joined, but I'm sure you'll get into the swing of things soon.
I know you must be worried about the girl who fell... but we should let her handle it.
I know you two already fulfilled the job I asked of you by stealing Kiuchi's Treasure.
I know you're right, but I'm way too restless\nfor that, heheh...
I know you're there... If you're trying to hide,\nyou're not doing a very good job of it.
I know you... You're that lemur we meet that\none time!
I know your name... {PLAYER_NAME}, isn't it?
I know your taste now.\nThose attacks won't work on me this time!
I know! A perfectly good Menace slipped right through our fingers. Of course, we'll need to find a replacement.
I know! Come to my work! You can borrow a\ntowel and hang out until your clothes dry.
I know! D'you think she'd let me snap a\nphoto if I asked? I want her on my\nlock screen!
I know! Do you think you could do it once\nmore? Right here.
I know! How about growing a vegetable\npatch here?
I know! I can help with the work\nMr. Yamanashi gave you!
I know! If it's okay with you, could I ask\nfor your honest opinion?
I know! It's easy to say all of that, but\nwhen it's really happening to you...
I know! Let's get some curry on the way home. Curry and some sleep might just fix me up.
I know! Why don't we exchange protein jelly\nrecommendations next time?
I know! Why don't we practice a bit before cleaning up?
I know! Why not try using a whip, Wind? It\nmight work out in the Metaverse!
I know, Masa-san! I'm going to fight anyway.
I know, right!? Being a teen is all about\nsnapping at adults for no good reason.
I know, right!? Take-kun isn't dealing with\nwhat's happening to him, don't you think?
I know, right?
I know, right? Feels like something you'd\nsee at a school.
I know, right? I can't believe it!
I know, right? Okay, back to batting\npractice!
I know, right? We shouldn't overdo it. Let's\ntake a break.
I know, right? Whoever came up with this\nmust've been a genius, don't you think?
I know, talk about selfish, right? Sorry to\ndrag you out here like this.
I know. And to take place here of all places.
I know. But I think Take-kun will be able to\nstand up for himself from now on.
I know. Honestly, having you around makes me\nfeel a lot more at ease.
I know. That's the most important thing.\nI don't think you can win with impact alone.
I know. The orange tabby isn't there, is he?
I know. You always say that.
I know...
I learn so much from talking to you.
I learned my lesson from the whole potato\ndebacle.
I learned some mocktail tips\nfrom Shiina.
I learned that charm\ncomes in many forms...\nboth graceful and deadly!
I learned that the words<color=#FF423F>limited time only</color>\nhold great power over human hearts.
I learned that there are no\nshortcuts in the pursuit of\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>...
I left a bigger impact on her\nthan I thought...
I left the batting cages with\nMotoha, who by all accounts is\npushing herself too hard.
I left the countryside for the city, hoping\nto become a star on the silver screen... Like\nthe ones I saw in films as a child...
I left the diner with Motoha.
I left without giving it much thought, but to\nbe honest, I feel like I screwed up.
I leisurely sipped my drink\nwhile imagining how it\nwas made...
I like Closer's attitude. C'mon, Skull! Get\nout there!
I like Lord Aquamarine!
I like being with you. As Phantom Thieves and\notherwise...
I like custard, but as a protein shake?\nSounds a li'l adventurous for my taste.
I like helping teachers with things I'm good\nat.
I like it here, though. It's quiet, lots\nof nature...
I like it when others watch me, but not when\nthey judge me. So maybe this tournament isn't\nfor me.
I like it.|It's embarrassing.|I wanna be a more luxurious potato.
I like running. Wandering aimlessly? Not so\nmuch! Ahaha!
I like that enthusiasm! It's got me feeling\nexcited too!

I looked around the platform,\nbut she's nowhere to be seen...
I looked at some\nof his photos...
I looove you, Tanemura-san! What a talented\nyoung lady you are!
I lost it before I could.

I love watching Yumi-chan move. It's like\nshe's really dancing back there!
I love watching videos online. I do it all\nthe time!
I love when he writes about his cheat day\nmeals. Just readin' it makes me drool!
I love working at this place! I really\nappreciate you hiring me, boss...
I made Shiina a mocktail,\nand she taught me how to\nmake a new one in return...
I made a mistake I'd made in a previous\ncompetition, and I guess that made him blow\nhis top.
I made a mocktail for Shiina.
I made a promise to meet\nYui's friend in person.
I made a promise to some other muscles...\nThis lady came up to me the other day and\nsaid she wanted to try working out.

I made myself out like some tragic martyr...
I made some curry in\nthe kitchen...
I made the rounds in\nthe crowded shop...
I made this song for all the people who have\nsupported me until now.

I make orders all the time.|I don't use it very often.

I managed to drag myself\nto the locker room and\nreturn to class...
I managed to finish up my rehab, but it was a\nreally hard, painful process.
I managed to keep the potato\nmoles at bay alone. Even had\ntime to fertilize the soil.
I managed to make it\nthrough the day somehow...
I may not know this Kaneshiro guy, but I'm\ntakin' this personally.
I may suffer some damage too...
I mean it. You're brimming with confidence. From my perspective at least.
I mean yes, but before that, I could have\nsworn... Hmmm...
I mean, I believe it is the best path for\nme. This is what I want, Ms. Katayama.
I mean, I came all the way to Japan to please\nmy parents.
I mean, I get it, but... I didn't expect you\nguys to be jocks.
I mean, I guess if you don't mind then\nit's fine.
I mean, I just wanted to be able to enjoy\ndoing what I liked, but...
I mean, I know I'm also young, so maybe that\ndoesn't make a lot of sense, but...
I mean, I like studying the language, and my\nlife here is far from boring, it's just...
I mean, I was kinda depressed right after\nwe split...
I mean, I'm probably all flush right now, so\nit's kinda embarrassing to face you\ndirectly...
I mean, curry udon is a thing, so it's not as\nunusual as it is rare.
I mean, don't those kinds of entities always\nseem to come back even after the case is\nsolved?
I mean, first off, he's the one who's overworking himself for me if I'm not there to keep him in check!
I mean, he was never really a talkative guy,\nnor was he around much at home with his job\nas a truck driver...
I mean, if it tastes good...|Better than waiting in line.
I mean, if you won't do it, you won't\ndo it... But you will, right?
I mean, it's not like I'm using a whip in my\neveryday life, right?
I mean, it's nothing super serious, don't\nworry. Just a lot of minor things...
I mean, it's the least I can do after you\nworked so hard to save them!
I mean, just look at them! The firmness,\nthe sheen, the definition of these muscles...\nIs that not the ultimate result?
I mean, me even gettin' to enter the\ncompetition was a bit of a windfall in\nitself.
I mean, that would certainly be of great help\nto me, but...
I mean, the only person who can decide what's\nright for me is me!
I mean, the title says it all. I'm in love\nwith it too! Head over heels! Whoops,\nsorry, that was a little overboard...
I mean, there are weird statues of Kiuchi, and apparently merch...?
I mean, there's no way I can slack off with\nall those wandering eyes...
I mean, we were just waiting out here for\nMr. Akashi to come back foreeever.
I mean, we'll take a look but...
I mean, what if I run into a regular or\nsomething? That'd totally take the wind out\nof my sails on a day off...
I mean, what kind of person rides their bike\nthrough a train car?
I mean, who in their right mind wants to eat\ntakeout ramen? Am I right?
I mean... Haha, of course it was! She's only in grade school!
I mean... How could one individual ever do\nthat? But yes, the answer is ending of a war.
I mean... I feel like someone took the evil\nout of my heart...
I mean\u2014! After work, of course!

I might end up making a big fool of myself, but... I'm counting on you, {NAME1}-kun.
I might have to give the\nold man another call...

I must admit, I have quite the discerning eye\nwhen it comes to reading material, so it\ncaught my interest.
I must agree, this doesn't seem like the safest part of town. Let us make haste.
I must apologize...
I must assert that this arrangement is not\npart of our contract, so you are not obliged\nto come. What do you say?
I must be mistaken...
I must issue you an urgent warning.
I must say, I did find the part where the\nchild evolved by eating genetically enhanced\nbacon to be a little far-fetched...
I must say, I'm impressed by your cordiality\namongst the utter chaos...
I must say, I'm incredibly grateful for how\nyou accompanied me to the con caf\xe9 earlier.
I must say, I'm incredibly grateful for how\nyou accompanied me to the photoshoot earlier.
I must say, it exceeded my expectations.\nThe descriptions of the cyber mechanisms\nwere quite interesting!

I must say, of all the places to make an entrance, this isn't half bad.
I must say, of all the places to make an\nentrance, this isn't half bad.
I must say, there are certain things I\nrefrain from doing in plain sight.
I must seem pretty scholarly now, huh?\nHahaha! Don't let this make me your\nfavorite teacher, though, okay?
I must support you as you undergo Master's\ntrial of desire, as is my duty.
I must thank you two somehow as well...\nMy, so much to do!
I need a workbench.|Trying to find a workbench.

I never doubted you from the start!
I never expected that you'd show up with a\ntambourine of all things!

I never heard of him either. Why do you ask?
I never imagined <color=#FF423F>slamming into things</color>\nwould bring us here. Let's explore.

I never imagined that I would develop such an\nintense desire to support Naruru.
I never knew there was such intentional\ndesign in their hives... Without that\nknowledge, one might never notice.
I never meant to upload it, so I took it down\nimmediately and apologized in\nthe comments...
I never put in that kinda effort. I also ate\na ton of fried chicken. Ahaha...

I ought to invite someone\nhere so I can share this\ndelicious flavor with them.
I overdid it with stretching...|Kano broke me...
I overheard the Shadows talking just now.\nThat must be the <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> they mentioned.

I practiced crafting\ninfiltration tools in my head.
I present you your cash prize of 6,000 yen!
I presume the deities would focus their\nefforts on the largest first. In the\nmeantime, let's enjoy the view.
I presume the two are quite different. Which\nis your true desire?
I probably could've phrased things better\nthough.
I probably would've tapped out if I were all\nalone... It was so encouraging knowing you\nwere by my side!
I promise I won't stare at you resentfully\nwhile you eat!
I promise to repay your kindness next time.\nNow, sorry, if you'll excuse me, I should...

I provide for my apprentices, and in return...
I put a little extra in your pay for today.\nYou've earned it.
I put a lot a thought into every kebab.\nAll to hear customers like you say\n"it's tasty!"

I put on my swimsuit and everything, but...
I put the book I found\non the bookshelf...

I read up on Kotone-san on the internet.
I realized that not even the\nworld's biggest ruby is more\nprecious than <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...

I really appreciate everyone helping\nwith cleanup and field maintenance.
I really can't see him being her knight in\nshining armor though.
I really do appreciate Kayo-san's support.\nIt's super encouraging.
I really do feel more at ease with you\naround. Now, this means we've managed to\nfully regroup.
I really do love sweets. Like the little ones\nmy coach gives me as a reward from time\nto time.
I really don't know. But a pretty significant\nnumber of his fans seem to think it is.
I really enjoyed reading it, so I wanted to\nthank them. I'll have to ask Ren about it later.
I really feel best when I'm true to myself!
I really have to get\nto school soon...
I really hope so!
I really hope that with this, we can make Tomoko feel better. Even if it's just a little bit.
I really hope that... you'll stick with me\ntill then...
I really like your usual look, Wind, but this\none is beautiful, too!
I really love that big hood. And the color is\nsuper cute, too!
I really love the ocean.
I really loved the beach house!
I really must agree...
I really prefer to learn by doing. If you end\nup going to the Metaverse, I'd like to\ncome with and <color=#FF423F>test it out</color> for real.
I really sang\nmy heart out today.
I really thought I was the scum of the earth,\nbut meeting Wonder and the others made me\nrealize something.
I really thought this would be the last time,\nbut nothing changed... I feel so stupid.
I really want to be a proper one.
I really worked up an appetite in gym class\ntoday... But you make sure to dig in too!
I recall a similar contraption from Kiuchi's\nPalace. Perhaps we can learn from it.
I recall seeing an ornament like this in\nKiuchi's Palace.
I received a Rare Book from\nKurotani and left the library.
I received a Rare Book from\nKurotani and left the roof.
I received a Rare Book from\nKurotani, and we put a pin in\nthe Assassin's Juice case.
I received a Rare Book,\nand parted ways with\nKurotani and Take.
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani and left\nthe Hall of Lament.
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani and left\nthe Harrowed Grounds.
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani and left\nthe rooftop.
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani,\nthen we parted ways.
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani...
I received it for free,\nso it feels weird to\nask her for money.
I received the woman's lost\nproperty from Anderson.
I recognize that you are eager to fulfill our\ncontract.
I recommend a mixture of honey and lemon\non toast. I'm sure you'll find it to satisfy\nyour cravings in many delightful ways!
I recommend choosing something more Germanic\nor Latin inspired to match ours. Otherwise,\nit would feel out of place.
I recommend steamin' it instead. That way\nthe nutrients can't escape.
I recommend trying it with salted squid\non top.
I recommend you have some of Ren's coffee.\nIt removes fatigue with truly\nunnatural efficacy.
I recommended some\ncomedies to Minami...
I refer to such items as <color=#FF423F>Treasure</color>.\nBut before we get into that...
I reflected on a battle\nagainst a powerful opponent\nin the past...
I refuse to allow such a trivial matter\nescalate into an undignified debate!
I refuse to...hurt my students!
I relaxed in my room with\nMerope. She pelted me with\nquestions, but it was fun.
I remember Kamoshida's Palace having hidden\npassages behind paintings...
I remember back when I was a kid, I used to really love the soup, but I wasn't really feeling it this time.
I remember once when I was a kid, I was\nhavin' ramen with my dad at home...
I remember that day.
I remember that guy. He has a long, oval-shaped head and...
I remember the cruel things I said to you...\nCalling you overbearing...
I remember this.
I remember when my hubby and I were in\nhigh school...
I remember you had some video games in your room.
I remember you. Looks like the little smart-mouthed brat's all grown up.
I remember your homeroom teacher saying\nsomething to that effect yesterday.
I remember.|Sort of.
I remembered how much <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\nit took not to give up\nback then...
I remembered that, so I was on my way here to\ncheck when I heard Ms. Katayama yelling.
I rented it!
I request a <color=#72C5FF>Jack Frost</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Lucky Punch</color>.
I request a <color=#72C5FF>Lilim</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Attack Boost I</color>.
I request a <color=#72C5FF>Neko Shogun</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Tarukaja</color>.
I request an order of the "Gimme Your Love\u266a\nFave Omelette Rice."
I respected the bravery of\nthe employees who stood up\nfor their rights...
I respected the officer's\n<sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color> as he stayed\ntrue to his values...
I returned home while on\nthe phone with Shimizu...
I said I can't help you right now! Besides,\nif you're gonna talk to my friend like\nthat...
I said goodbye to Haruna and\nleft the diner.
I said goodbye to Minami and\nthe kids and left the shop.
I said goodbye to Minami's\ndad and left the shop...
I said goodbye to Tomoko and\nleft the convenience store.
I said goodbye to Tomoko and\nleft the diner.
I said goodbye to Tomoko\nand left the cr\xeape shop.
I said goodbye to Yamagoshi\nand went home...
I said goodbye to Yaoling,\nand headed for the station.
I said it was a risky move! I wasn't\nfinished explaining...
I said it's "-sama" to you!
I said it's Miyazawa's Shadow! Essentially a\nmanifestation of Miyazawa's desire!
I said keep quiet! Or I'll get caught!
I said my goodbyes to Haruna\nand the others and left\nthe diner.
I said my goodbyes to a newly\nuplifted Yaoling, and headed\nfor the station.
I said pipe down, didn't I!?
I said quiet on set! How dare you interrupt\nthe leading role's lines!
I said shut up. Your empty words repulse me.
I said so before, didn't I? I don't intend\nfor this job to limit your freedom.
I said this was Kiuchi's Palace, did I not? His cognitions from real life...
I said tonight, didn't I? I'm sure you'll be hungry by then.
I said worst-case scenario, didn't I?
I sang all sorts of songs\nuntil my time was up.
I sang and sang until my time\nwas up.
I sang my heart out in a solo\nkaraoke room.
I savored the mocktail\nShiina made for me to\nmy heart's content...
I saw Tanemura-senpai in the cafeteria\nduring lunch today! She was looking cool as always!
I saw a help wanted sign in the window of a nearby convenience store.
I saw him counting the bills in his wallet,\nwith a worried look on his face.
I saw it on the television... But I can't recall the name.
I saw more examples that made me question how\nthey failed. That's a sure sign of progress!
I saw off a panicking Yaoling,\nand headed for the station...
I saw someone who went to "borrow" an\numbrella during a sudden shower.
I saw the Food Fight video. You caught my eye\nwith how you were able to impress Miyazawa.
I saw the band club perform. All the members\nfrom back then have already graduated now.
I saw the dessert featured on a television\nprogram. It seems it's only available for a\nlimited amount of time.
I saw you vanish at Shibuya Station, then\nI opened an odd app on my phone and found\nmyself here.
I saw.|You really gave it your all.
I say we destroy their power source like\nbefore to take out the cameras.
I say we ought to investigate.
I scored 60 points.
I scored 70 points.
I scored 80 points!
I scored 90 points!
I searched all over my house for it last\nnight, and I couldn't find it anywhere!
I second that! Oh, and Joker's a big eater\ntoo!
I second that.|It suits you.
I see an elevator there, but it's being\nguarded by Shadows.
I see light and hope everywhere you go...\nYou may find yourself attracting positive\nattention today!
I see no problem with having the desire to\nwin big from a small amount of money. But it\nseems like few people are buying them...
I see there are many reasons why humans would\nbe inclined to visit the cinema.
I see waiting for you here has paid off.
I see we have a lot to process here, but now is not the time.
I see you all have all have some problems\nyou're dealing with.
I see you are eager to fulfill our contract.
I see you haven't set one either.
I see you know of my ingenious feats.\nRejoice, for I shall graciously become\nyour mask...
I see you're having a wistful moment here, but we should keep moving.
I see you've finished tending to the plants.
I see you... as someone really important\nto me!
I see! Let me see here... One second...
I see! Then we can count on you to be a valuable asset to the team!
I see, I see.
I see, I see. He seems to be fond of you\nas well.
I see, I see. So strength isn't the key...
I see, I see... You've been very helpful!
I see, it's the same over there.
I see, so you were able to find all the\ntreasures for him again.
I see, we can get in this way! Very clever!
I see.
I see. Closer is the only one missing from\nour ranks.
I see. Considering the incident with Noge\ntoo, I believe you.
I see. However, I still perceive radiance\nfrom you even in this state.
I see. I assume that by running away, they\nincite their fans to give chase.
I see. I guess that's the way it goes. Maybe you\ncan help next time then...
I see. I personally consider myself an\navid reader.
I see. I read a fair number of them myself.\nLibraries stock them these days.
I see. I read a good few myself. You don't\nhave to worry about running out of them\neither. The genre is seemingly endless.
I see. I think I have an idea of its whereabouts. Thank you, Motoha.
I see. I understand that were my master here,\nit would certainly be difficult to relax.
I see. I was a staunch believer of\npaperbacks myself...
I see. In short, it is to escape reality?
I see. In that case...
I see. It all makes sense now.
I see. It seems it operates using something\n<color=#FF423F>other than electric or thermal energy</color>.
I see. It's better to follow a lead than to\nrun around aimlessly. Let's go, Wonder.
I see. Maybe that's what it means to be\na fan.
I see. Maybe this one will do then.
I see. Reflecting one's mental state and\nattaining mental calm are not one and\nthe same.
I see. So all that attention to detail\nis why Tanzo-san's yakitori is so delicious!
I see. So he puts on a character for his\nshows. That likely has something to do with\nthe cause of his corruption.
I see. So that's why she decided to ask one\nof you.
I see. So you don't have an excess of wealth at your disposal?
I see. So, in other words...
I see. So, the confessions from Kiuchi\nand Hiromu Miyazawa were a result\nof your "work."
I see. Sorry for making you practice all\nby yourself.
I see. Take care then.\nBe careful on your way home.
I see. Then study harder to be number one\nnext time.
I see. Then the voice I heard came from the\nowl hiding in {NAME1}-kun's bag...
I see. Then there's no mistaking it.
I see. They are right that rhythm is\nimportant for a mid-tempo ballad.
I see. We appear to be in similar situations.
I see. Well at least you don't have to worry\nabout getting lost at the gym, right?
I see. Well, that can't be helped.
I see. Whether it's correct or not depends on\nthe viewer's outlook and knowledge.
I see. Wonder, what do you think?
I see. You must have used the Metaverse Navigator. The eye-shaped icon on your phone.
I see. Your resolve is quite noble.
I see...
I see... A master-disciple dynamic, was it?\nPleased to meet you.
I see... All their training in the lush\nforest was to acquire the skills for that\nclimactic final.
I see... But why don't you just let me tell\nHaruna's mom whatever it is?
I see... By utilizing a wide range of\nskills, your personal <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>is\neven stronger.
I see... Go on.
I see... I always end up going for the\nsafe option instead.
I see... I was afraid you'd say that...
I see... I wonder if that conviction is\nanother symptom of your strong desire.
I see... I'll take that into consideration.
I see... It has the same characteristics as\nthe Whirlwinds, but is more powerful\nand convenient.
I see... It really is that popular...
I see... It's like money laundering.
I see... It's similar to how we phantom\nthieves havea knack for finding infiltration\nclues from seemingly unrelated things.
I see... It's totally possible I heard wrong.\nStill, it's a cool story, right?
I see... Knowing you can approach things\nobjectively like that does make me\nfeel better.
I see... Let's go together when you're free.
I see... No problem. I'll just lug both of\nthese back home.
I see... Priests and shrine maidens are\nconsidered trustworthy, so it was an ideal\nmethod to gather information...
I see... Seeing the story from a different\nperspective provides us with more nuance.
I see... So it was my destiny to find\nmyself within you!
I see... So my fears were not unfounded.
I see... So that boy is Shun Kano. He looks\nlike he has a promising future ahead of him.
I see... So this is how he views the world.
I see... So we can use that device to operate\ndoors, it would seem.
I see... That might be worth a try.
I see... That's a shame.
I see... That's a shame. I guess I'll just\nhave to memorize it somehow.
I see... That's fine. Um, sorry for asking so\nout of the blue.
I see... Well, I hope you reconsider.
I see... Well, I want you to be there when\nit happens, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun. Let me know next\ntime you're free!
I see... Well, don't worry about it.
I see... Well, gimme a holler next time\nyou're free then!
I see... Well, maybe next time, then.
I see... Yes, that does make some sense.\nWe'll need to find and destroy those\nas well.
I see.... So that means we might have to\nextend our search beyond here?
I see...\nOutstanding indeed...
I see.\nWell then, let's give it a shot, Wonder!
I see.|You got it.
I seem different than before?
I sense Shadows inside...
I sense a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Shiina.
I sense a large number of Shadows ahead.\nDon't let your guard down.
I sense a large number of Shadows here.\nLet's proceed with caution.
I sense a number of powerful foes...
I sense a presence similar to a Palace\nup ahead, but something's... off.
I sense a stronger presence than usual.\nPerhaps...
I sense another flower quiz ahead\ncoming up...
I sense it too. A potent attack is imminent.\nEveryone, stand your ground!
I sense more Shadows ahead. Exercise proper\ncaution.
I sense something from within its form. It appears to have amassed human desire within itself...
I sense something in the basement. I only\nsmell one this time around too.
I sense something on the other side of\nthat gate...
I sense something similar to Treasure inside.\nIf this is somebody's Palace...
I sense the Core in that direction...
I sense the Treasure nearby...\nAnd something else...
I sense the presence of a special Shadow\nnearby... Keep an eye out for it.
I sense the presence of two Cores here.
I sense the same energy from this as the\n<color=#FF423F>Red Fog</color>.
I sense the treasure is still quite far.\nProbably much higher up.
I sensed the influence of another\nhuman being.
I sensed there'd be some pertinent\ninformation to be gained from your\nconversation, hence I revealed myself.
I sent a message to Yui asking\nif her friend wants to go to\nthe burger shop today.
I seriously panicked when I almost lost it.
I shall be your personal interior decorator,\nRusset!
I shall become a fiery mask of thine,\nwith my powers to see the past and future...
I shall become a mask and make use of my\nwisdom to create a profitable future for you.
I shall become a mask of affection to\nguard you, like a mother watching\nover her weak child...

I shall become your mask and show you the\nauthority I hold over the dogs of war...
I shall bring help to your marvelous soul.
I shall endeavor to provide you with even\ngreater support.
I shall explain everything you need to know...\nwhen we get there!
I shall first teach you the basic chants\nwhich can be used for any idol.
I shall follow your will, and facilitate the\ngrowth of all creation...
I shall follow your will, and keep a watchful\neye over all the world...
I shall follow your will, and protect all\nliving things...
I shall follow your will, and subjugate\nall wickedness...
I shall grant you some of my\noverflowing glamor...
I shall invite you there next time.
I shall leave that decision up to Wonder.
I shall protect you with my life as though\nI were an iron shield.
I shall raise your heart to the highest\ncelestial plateau.
I shall renounce the world and become an\nidle recluse, spending the rest of my days\nwith the flowers and the moon.
I shall see that resolve carried out.
I shall serve you from the depths of\nyour heart.
I shall unleash the mystical powers\nwithin you.
I shared a special moment\nwith Yumi.
I shared my fried rice with Shun, so I wanted\nto get a bite of his as well...
I shared the joy of our first\nvictory with everyone on\nthe soccer team...
I should ask them to let me\npass through...
I should be able to deepen my\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> if I study here...
I should be able to take part, but...
I should be careful not\nto overdo it.
I should be punished under the law...
I should be thanking you.|Really?|Of course I said yes.
I should be the one thankin' you, Skull.\nAll of you, really... I appreciate it.
I should bring a girl with\na sweet tooth here next time.
I should check with Tanzo.
I should choose my next\nwords carefully...
I should choose my\nnext words carefully...
I should come back\nanother time.
I should come back\nanother time...
I should follow their example, y'know?\nLike help out with my dad's shop more.
I should get bonus pay by\nworking at Heritage\nKitchen today...
I should get bonus pay by\nworking at Hinokuniya\nin Shinjuku today...
I should get bonus pay by\nworking at Million\nSweets today...
I should get bonus pay by\nworking at the beef bowl\nshop in Shibuya today...

I should get her some water.
I should get home...
I should get to bed too...
I should get to school...
I should go and meet the\norange tabby if I have\nthe time.
I should go back home\nand change...
I should go look\nfor Chizuko...
I should go mention this\nto Violet later...
I should head to school first.
I should head to the roof...
I should just clean up\nthe trash...
I should leave them alone.
I should let them know. Hopefully everything\ngoes to plan.
I should look carefully...
I should make sure Haruna\nsticks with her mom.
I should pick up my prize\nbefore I leave...
I should probably get going. Talk to you guys later!
I should probably\nhead home soon...
I should report back\nto Merope.
I should schedule in another shift after school...
I should seriously try to suppress my inner\nmom instincts... Lesson learned!
I should stop her.
I should talk to him\nnext time I see him...
I should tell the owner about this. I just\nhope it doesn't lead to any trouble.
I should try going to\nInokashira Park...
I should try to break the ice myself\nsometime though.
I should try using the Incubus\nI just got.
I should wake her up...
I should watch and learn from your example.
I should've known.
I should\n<color=#FF423F>observe carefully</color>here...
I shouldn't be making you deal with all\nmy problems...
I shouldn't go accepting expensive gifts from\nhigh schoolers... I guess?
I showed Tomiyama the shopping\ndistrict. She was captivated\nby the local fashion.
I shut myself off from it altogether. But...
I signed in to\nHarvest World Online.
I signed on to\nHarvest World Online.
I sincerely hope that you are the latter.
I skipped cram school today since I felt like\ngoing to the arcade.
I sleep like a rock.|I don't really...
I slipped... Could you help me up?
I smell a Core this way...
I smell grilled meat...
I sold flowers and helped\nthe owner around the shop.
I solved it...!
I solved the practice\nquestions by myself...
I somehow managed to\ncalm Seiji down...
I spent a long time with\nYaoling before heading home...
I spent some alone time with\nYaoling before heading home...
I spent some time alone with\nYui in my virtual room... She\nseemed to be having fun.
I spent some time with Yui in\nmy virtual room. We discussed\nour living preferences.
I spent time alone with a\ndrunk Yumi... After walking\nher back, I headed home too.
I spoke that way intentionally because I\nthought it'd be amusing. My apologies.
I spoke with Tomoko about\npreparing the cheer song\nfor Kotone.
I spy a map! Let's see here...
I stand here every day, listening to the\nmuscles of the people walkin' by.
I started carrying it around because people\nkept thinking I was taking creep shots.
I started dancing because I heard it helps\nyou keep in shape, but I just had so much\nfun.
I started imitating ranger heroes when I was\na kid because I thought they were cool.
I started my new job at\nthe flower shop.
I started up the game console\nin my room...
I stayed up way too late last night. I can barely keep my eyes open...
I steeled myself and drank it.
I still can't believe she was called out\non Divine Justice.
I still don't get it.|You two have fun.
I still don't know if there'll be a next time for you two...
I still don't know many people around here,\nand there's a lot of stuff I don't understand.
I still don't know what flavors I think are\nbest... I have so much work to do.
I still don't know what\nhe's saying...
I still don't think you're gonna\nfind anything.
I still feel like he wants to\ntell me something...
I still gotta treat myself from time to time,\nbut I might lose control if I'm alone.
I still lack both knowledge and experience.\nI need to keep developing my palate.
I still need a little more time! Just a little, I swear!
I still sucked, but I played in a much better\nmood than before.
I still wanted to play though. So I've been\ntrying to keep it up...
I stop by for a few drinks when I have time,\nso I know all the bars here.
I strongly anticipate that this "something"\nis one of those <color=#FF423F>baseballs</color> we're after.
I struggled a lot back in the day. There are\nthings I've gained and also lost...
I studied flower arranging for the same\nreason.
I suddenly thought of a way to\nuse the new math formula we\nlearned in class...!
I suggest we take our business on-site to\nachieve the most effective results.
I suggested that things might go better if he\ntried keeping a positive attitude.
I support you as a fan.|I feel the same way you do.
I suppose I could guide you through it.
I suppose I'll just take the elevator\nalong with you and your companions.
I suppose Kiuchi has a vivid imagination.
I suppose appetite is another form of human desire. On that note, what kind of restaurant are we going to?
I suppose he's honest about his desires.\nBut still, I can't say it's a pretty sight.
I suppose if they couldn't handle the\nheat, they wouldn't be in the kitchen!
I suppose it's the chosen ones, now that I've\nfound you.
I suppose my first ever love letter also\nslipped from my grasp...
I suppose one is never too old to dance!
I suppose our only choice is to fight.
I suppose she has a talent for rationalizing\nher desires, if nothing else. Now let's\nfinish this.
I suppose so, but why?
I suppose so... All right then. What we do is\nup to you.
I suppose that means we won't even be\nable to process what happened once we're\nback, either.
I suppose that speaks to just how good Leblanc's coffee and curry are. Hehe, great minds think alike and all.
I suppose that's it for today. Thank you for\nyour time, {NAME1}-san.
I suppose there is such a thing as excessive\ndesire.
I suppose those Tokyo-themed confections\nare for tourists, but they may be\nworth trying!
I suppose we could call it a Cluster Whirlwind.\nWe can make use of these to rapidly increase\nour speed of travel.
I suppose we might as well make a statement\nand let the world know who the Subway Slammer\nreally is.
I suppose we'll just have to head to school\nand hope we arrive before the rain starts.
I suppose we're challengers, then?\nMore importantly...
I suppose you really can't assume that\neveryone's on the same page as you.
I suppose you're right... It's not always\nabout being correct.
I sure am! C'mon, let's do this!
I sure can. My late husband loved music. I tried all kinds of instruments myself.
I sure do hope this old geezer can keep up\nwith you youngsters!
I sure will.|If you say so...
I suspect there's treasure in here.
I swear they didn't move an inch until that\nshow was over.
I swung the bat while\nlistening to Motoha's advice.
I take back what I said before
I take it the drink is to your liking. Shall\nwe order another?
I take it we are in agreement.
I take it you are eager to fulfill our\ncontract.
I talked about it with my wife. If we work\ntogether, we should be able to make it\nthrough this...
I talked about it with {NAME1}-kun and Arai-san\nbefore, but I didn't check with you\nyet, Kano-kun.
I talked with Ayaka about\nforeign countries we'd like\nto visit someday...
I tapped into a few of their distinctive\nflavor profiles to produce this meal.
I tend to give people presents or treat them\nto meals even when they're my senior.
I thanked Minami for the drink\nand saw her back to the shop.
I think Ayaka needs some\nmotivation to find\nher courage...
I think I added too much chili paste. It did\nsay "to taste" on the packet...
I think I broke somethin'!
I think I can do this now!
I think I can go in from here.
I think I can write some good lyrics or tunes\nwhen I'm here...
I think I get how you feel.|It seemed... genuine.
I think I get how you feel.|We should've really taken one.
I think I knew that somewhere deep in my\nheart, I deluded myself, refusing to see the\ntruth.
I think I know of a way in.
I think I know... But Miyazawa threw them\nall away...
I think I mentioned this earlier, but my\nmotif is the concept of "change."
I think I might've already given up back then.
I think I might've upset her...
I think I need to come to grips with what happened in Kiuchi's past first.
I think I need to see it.
I think I said this before, but Motoha was\nmy idol.
I think I used... too much... power...
I think I was able to do the same. And it\nmight be thanks to the courage you gave me.
I think I'd like to try searching for a\nPalace with the name Kumi Katayama.
I think I'd like to use it for my\ncalligraphy classes as well.
I think I'll be coming back here again soon.\nNo, you can count on it!
I think I'll bring this to the park and enjoy\na nice drink with my skewers.
I think I'll check it out...
I think I'll need some time to think over\nTake-kun's words.
I think I'll pass.
I think I'll stop by a restaurant on the way\nhome. Now, diner or burger shop? Decisions,\ndecisions.
I think I'll try to go to bed early today.
I think I'm getting the hang of this though.\nOne step at a time, right?
I think I'm gonna do a little shopping now.\nWanna come with?
I think I'm realizing that friendships really\ndepend on the way you treat the other person.
I think I'm starting to\nremember something...
I think I've discovered a new\nappreciation for drinks...
I think I've learned some important lessons\nfrom this whole ordeal.

I will. Thanks.
I wish I could drink it forever.|I already want more.
I wish Miyazawa would just admit his\nwrongdoing to the world like Kiuchi did...
I wish good fortune upon thee.
I wish guys would fall all over me IRL like they do in dating sims...
I wish she'd talk like that with us...
I wish that more people would see them for\ntheir positive meaning.
I wish to accompany you... No matter\nhow far... No matter how long...

I work at a bunch of places but, well, I've\nknown you for a while. Thoughts?
I work at an office nearby. If you come here\noften, I'm sure we'll meet again.
I work for an IT company. Our office is\nactually right here in Shibuya.
I worked the register while\nTomoko took care of\nthe shelves...
I worked with a friend to come up with it.\nWalking is one of the best exercises for\nyour muscles!
I would also like the Love Stack Pancakes and\nthe Cutie Cat Strawberry Parfait.
I would also like to apologize for my earlier\nremarks about the ramenburger.
I would appreciate it if you would come\nas soon as possible.
I would expect no less from you. I am honored\nto be your concierge.
I would gladly contribute to such a grand ambition.
I would have been searching all day if you\nhadn't come around.
I would have loved to have gotten a firsthand look at such desire myself.
I would hope so, but... Is it all right with\nour leader?
I would inscribe a riddle involving desire\non mine. Doesn't that sound bold?
I would like for us to expend all efforts in\nsupporting Naruru at today's event.

I wouldn't call them bad, at least. Well,\naside from that quasi-cat.
I wouldn't have come to you in the first\nplace if I wasn't so worried.
I wouldn't have made this discovery if you\ndidn't hang out with me today, {NAME2}.
I wouldn't if I were you! You won't get anything from all the drunks around here!
I wouldn't say that... I sense a strange omen\nof change near the entrance.

I wrote down {PLAYER_NAME}\non the paper.
I'd also recommend a park with lots of trees.
I'd appreciate if you could help me out.\nYou see, there's a word I've been\nwondering about...
I'd argue, however, that organs which are\nactually unnecessary tend to degenerate, and\nthe environment plays a major factor.
I'd be ashamed to let it end now...
I'd be ever so much obliged to get a ticket,\nand I bet you'd be real happy to see this\ndistortion fixed.
I'd be happy to help.|Guess I have to.|That's a lot for me to handle.
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't hopin' to\ndevelop my palette more, like when we're\nhangin' out...
I'd been deceiving myself as well until\npretty recently.
I'd been saving up to buy a new machine.\nIf I raid my savings, I'm sure I can make\nit work.
I'd been working until morning, and went to\nbed without even realizing what I'd done...
I'd better tend to them\nonce I get home.
I'd do anything to make sure my wife and\ndaughter are happy.
I'd even wager that doing so is the basis of\nhumanity's strength.
I'd feel bad if I made her worry over me.
I'd forgotten. I originated from humanity's Sea of Souls...
I'd get to keep it all.|I'd only get part of it.|It would all be forfeit.
I'd go so far as to say it's culturally important there, as people even play it casually.
I'd hate to have more tests.\nBut I'd definitely welcome less!
I'd heard a bit about it from Masa-san. The\nLightning Legs thing was news to me though.
I'd hope so! I've prepared only the best for\nyou, Yukimi-san. Ah, over here!
I'd kind of like to see how you'd react to\nthat situation one day.

I'd prefer to escort you back to reality,\nbut...!

I'd rather date someone around my age.\nI don't wanna be looked down on...

I'd say... I'm more of a freeloader\nwho's looking after this place\nwhile the manager's out.
I'd think to myself, "What am I doing in this\nshop? Shouldn't I be on the field?"
I'd try my hand at every dance I could find.\nIt was all I could think about back then...
I'd try to talk to them whenever I could.

I'm a bit concerned about whether or not\nthis is what you really want.
I'm a cosplayer, and this is a replica of a\nsword from a video game...
I'm a cut above all other humans!
I'm a fan of natural sciences above all else. Ecosystems are where it's at!
I'm a fan of potatoes myself! In fact, it's\nmy favorite food altogether!
I'm a huge fan of your umeboshi!

I'm a picky eater, but I love cakes\nand pastries...
I'm a potato lover.|Do potatoes count?
I'm a second year at Kosei High School.
I'm able to focus\nand get to work...
I'm about to head to a part-time job, and I\nwas wondering if you'd like to join me.
I'm actually a bit of an expert when it comes\nto tea and dim sum.
I'm actually in the middle of my workday...\nBesides, I haven't had the time to work out\nlately even if I wanted to.
I'm actually out on a walk right now.
I'm actually pretty good at foreign\nlanguages. The proof is in my college\ngrades, hehe...
I'm afraid I have some business to take care\nof, so I don't think I'll be able to get over\nthere anytime soon...
I'm afraid it'll be a little expensive, given\nhow we got all the flowers...
I'm afraid not. Though I wouldn't expect\nstudents to know much about gems, anyway.
I'm afraid you're wrong. "Fate" is actually\nmore negative.
I'm all analog...
I'm all by myself now...
I'm all ears.|I'm kinda busy right now...
I'm all for checking out a new caf\xe9, but are\nyou sure we won't get in trouble for skipping\nclass?
I'm already in a <color=#FF423F>relationship</color>\nwith another person...
I'm also going to the bookstore.|I'm headed somewhere else.
I'm also in the restaurant business now, but\nI handle far more money each day than my\nfather's store ever did.
I'm also really grateful you came along, {NAME1}-kun.
I'm always eager to learn more about your\nneck of the woods.
I'm always hanging out here, unless it's raining!
I'm always happy to see one of Shun's\nfriends come by.
I'm always learning things from you, so it'd\nbe nice to be the teacher for once.
I'm always prepared... but I'm afraid I won't be kicking the bucket today!
I'm always starving after moving around a\nbunch. Now, what should I order today?
I'm an aspiring artist, so I live and train with the Japanese painter,
I'm an exchange student from Sichuan, China\nstudying at a Japanese college. I live around\nthis area.
I'm ashamed of my short-sightedness.
I'm astounded there is such a quiet retreat\nnear the shopping district.
I'm at a dead end with my recipe ideas for\nthe competition. Figured I could use a break.
I'm back in my\nregular clothes too...
I'm back in my\nregular clothes...
I'm back! I had to work a bit later than usual today.
I'm begging you, {NAME1}. Could you keep quiet about my leg for just a little longer?
I'm bound to break a bone carrying this much weight!
I'm bringing that incredible flavor all over\nthe country in the form of a brand new chai\u2014\nWhoops, can't say any more!
I'm bringing you along to the party\nof destruction!
I'm closing up for today, but if you ever need a glimpse into the future, I'll be right here.
I'm coming in!
I'm coming with you, so let's have some fun!
I'm completely fine... What are you doing\nhere, Mr. Akashi?
I'm counting on you today! I'm sure you\nwon't disappoint.
I'm counting on you!
I'm counting on you, cheer captain!
I'm counting on your delivery. The customer's\na waiting!
I'm curious about today's special drink.
I'm curious, but...
I'm currently near the movie theater in\nYongen-Jaya.
I'm definitely fired up to give this my all.
I'm definitely going to change things around here, so just hold out till then, okay?
I'm dieting right now, so I can't...\nI could go for a smoothie though.
I'm digging in to the curry first!
I'm doing my best, but there is always room\nfor improvement.
I'm doing the best I can, okay!?\nI just can't remember crap like\nnumbers and dates...
I'm done going easy on you! Now I'll crush you like the bugs you are!
I'm envious of you...
I'm even getting an odd sense of d\xe9j\xe0 vu.\nHow about you, Wonder?
I'm extremely grateful... I can't begin to\nexpress my thanks.
I'm fairly certain the manager told us\nwhere cough drops are. Do you recall?
I'm feeling a lot more positive now after\nour talk.
I'm feeling some really good lyrics coming on\nright now, so...
I'm fine with anywhere we can play together.
I'm fine with whatever he thinks is best for\nhim. I'll worry about the future later.
I'm fine with whatever...
I'm fine! Sit, sit!
I'm fine. Sorry I'm late.
I'm fine.|Are you okay?|That guy's a pain.
I'm fine.|It's just a little water.|Achoo!
I'm fine.|Thanks for that.|What about you?
I'm fine.|Yup, same as always.
I'm finished.|Sweet freedom.
I'm for it, but what would work?
I'm free.|I have errands to attend to.
I'm free.|I was going to take a nap...
I'm free.|Not now.
I'm free.|Sorry, got places to be.
I'm full... I couldn't eat another bite.
I'm getting a dashi base with a hint of tea\nleaves in the batter. This flavor...\nVery nice.
I'm getting all of them. You'd better think\nover what you're gonna order too.
I'm getting on in years, my left eye can't see so good anymore, I've got a bad back...
I'm glad I asked you about this.\nYou really are\u2014
I'm glad I have someone on my side.
I'm glad Tanemura got home safe. Now, we\nought to retire as well.
I'm glad it's packed with bean sprouts. The\ncrunchy texture really stands out.
I'm glad that I inspired you. But I'm not the\nsame person I was back then.
I'm glad to hear that! Truth is, I spent all\nmorning thinking about how to invite you.
I'm glad to hear your thoughts. I shall\nstrive to keep it in mind going forward.
I'm glad to see you took all those orders\nwithout incident.
I'm glad too. Please give me your true\nassessment; I'll take it in stride. Today I\ngive you an absolute classic.
I'm glad we came here today.
I'm glad we could come here today.
I'm glad we didn't start with sprints.
I'm glad we managed to make it before the\ncastle crumbled.
I'm glad you agreed to come. Oh, let me get\nyou some coffee.
I'm glad you came with me, {NAME1}-kun...
I'm glad you decided to come along. Wouldn't want you leaving in a bad mood, right?
I'm glad you understand.
I'm glad you're here. I need you to teach me\nmore about modern teens.
I'm glad you're interested in flowers.
I'm glad you're thinkin' of your old man, but you've got to rely on me too sometimes, okay?
I'm going home too.|I might stop somewhere.
I'm going in.
I'm going on ahead, so follow me!
I'm going to aim to become a nurse someday, even if that means a lot of studying.
I'm going to arrange the shelves while we\nhave some down time.
I'm going to come visit you every day! So please don't\u2014
I'm going to head straight home. What about\nyou two?
I'm going to make copies for everyone, and\nthen we can play!
I'm going to need more\n<sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color> if I want to\nwin this challenge...
I'm going to rewrite the song from memory\ntoday! Leave it to me!
I'm going to the batting cages today.
I'm going to try busking today!
I'm going!
I'm gonna be playing here for a while, so if\nyou'd like to stay and listen...
I'm gonna chase that dream for both of us!
I'm gonna do the song I played for you in\nthe park.
I'm gonna echo inside your heart, bro...\nWahooooo!
I'm gonna enter it.
I'm gonna get revenge for the penalty shootout the other day, {NAME1}.
I'm gonna go buy a storage rack right\nafter work tomorrow!
I'm gonna go. I've got studying to do.
I'm gonna head back to grab my stuff. And you\ncan get to work finding us another sucker.\nMaybe an old lady this time.
I'm gonna keep doing my best from now on.\nAnd you'll be there for me through it all,\nright?
I'm gonna keep doing whatever I want, for as long as I want!
I'm gonna make some puzzles for Shota-kun!\nReally good ones! Lots of 'em!
I'm gonna need to work even harder! I swear\nI'll keep working hard from here on out!
I'm gonna send all those li'l dust bunnies\nhoppin' into the trash can one by one!
I'm gonna try again!
I'm gonna visit Tomoko in the hospital. I wanna tell her what happened with Kiuchi.
I'm good to go whenever, so hit me up when you wanna search Mementos!
I'm grateful you've been so kind as to lend\nan ear, {NAME1}-san.
I'm handing back your pop quiz results today.\nThere were... quite a few spelling mistakes.
I'm happy everyone relies on me, but it's\nhard to keep it up all the time. Haha...
I'm happy that you thought of me.
I'm happy to explain anything you're curious\nabout!
I'm happy to hear that. Plus, it's also a\ngreat opportunity to learn. Please, tell\nme more!
I'm happy too.|Let's see a smile.
I'm happy you're happy.|Can't wait for the show!
I'm happy you've thought this through. Yes,\nyou could literally head to an early grave.
I'm happy, of course, but... I'm also running\nout of money.
I'm headed there now! See you in a bit!
I'm headed to the game center today!
I'm headed to the library, but if you wanna go to the Metaverse, just let me know, 'kay?
I'm headin' home too. {NAME2}, Lufel,\nsee you at school!
I'm headin' into the club room then.\nGotta tell Taiko the good news!
I'm here now trying to figure out what my\nfuture's supposed to be.
I'm here. And I know the passcode.
I'm holdin' on somehow. But if we take\nanother hit like that...
I'm home, Kayo-san.
I'm home.
I'm honored that you remember. We have come\nto patronize your establishment.
I'm honored to witness such a daring feat.\nNow, let's be on our way.
I'm honored.|I'd love to do this again.
I'm impressed you withstood that attack.\nI think I underestimated you.
I'm in deep shit if I fail this next test...\nEven Ann said so...
I'm in my Phantom Thief clothes, but there\naren't any Shadows. It almost feels like\nd\xe9j\xe0 vu.
I'm in the mood for something sweet\u2014no wait,\na giant hamburger!
I'm in too.|Let's take back everything he's stolen.
I'm in... Shibuya...?
I'm in.|I already made plans...
I'm in.|Not today...
I'm in.|Now's not a good time...
I'm joking. Why aim for critical hits at\npoint-blank range?
I'm just a bit worried about you since we won't be back for a while.
I'm just getting in the door.|Did something happen?
I'm just glad it didn't go any further than it did, you know?
I'm just going in circles, dragging you around...
I'm just kiddiiing! Well, mostly. I certainly\nwouldn't say no if they had it.
I'm just not the type to strike up\nconversations with others, so I thought you\nwere going to break some news to me.
I'm just one of hundreds, aren't I?
I'm just peachy. Well, so long as you're okay, young man.
I'm just really glad you're here,\n{NAME1}-kun.
I'm just sick of covering up other people's\nmistakes...
I'm kidding! Sorry, I just thought it\nwouldn't hurt to ask, that's all.
I'm kidding. But as the backbone of this\ngroup, you should consider it.
I'm kind of nervous,\nbut I think I want to try them.
I'm kind of surprised it went this quickly!
I'm kinda embarrassed now showing it to you!\nStill, I'm glad you enjoyed it!
I'm kinda nervous being back here... Oh yeah, we gotta use code names, right? Wonder and Cattle, was it?
I'm kinda thirsty, so I'm gonna grab a lemonade. Why don't you have one with me?
I'm like that too. I let my mood decide what\nto eat.
I'm listening. Yeah, it's that news. I'm watching it too.
I'm living in the same city as Ikenami-kun,\nso there's a chance we'll meet someday...
I'm lookin' forward to it too. I wonder\nhow much weight the hero's gonna bench\nthis week!
I'm looking for a workbench.|Do you sell workbenches?
I'm looking for some flowers for a proposal...
I'm looking for something probably closer to\nwhat you're pursuing on a daily basis.
I'm looking forward to seeing what\nheartwarmin' moments'll be captured\nhere forever!
I'm making contact with the ball more than\nbefore. Home runs will happen at some point.
I'm making today my cheat day.
I'm more of a paperback person.|I prefer e-books.
I'm no Shadow from this place. I used to be\nlivin' in that there sea of the human soul!
I'm no better than you... I chose to abandon my dreams.
I'm no genius.\nDoctors are way cooler!
I'm not a Metaverse expert by any means, but it seems like a suitable place for gathering experience.
I'm not a Shadow here, ho! I live in\nthe sea of the hee-human heart!
I'm not a Shadow that lives here! I'm\nfrom the sea of souls of you humans!
I'm not a cat!
I'm not actually a Shadow. I... have existed\nin the sea of souls with humanity for all\ntime...
I'm not as smart as Haruna. I can't go off\nto college in America.
I'm not as smart as she is. I feel like if I\ndon't study, she's just going to keep getting\nfurther and further away from me.
I'm not being ridiculous. It's my job to\nuproot old ways of thinking like that.
I'm not entirely sure what's\ngoing on, but it seems I don't\nhave any other options...
I'm not entirely sure what\nshe's saying, but that's\nTomiyama for you...
I'm not exactly sure this prince's actions\nwere truly motivated by kindness...
I'm not forcing myself to.
I'm not going to forgive you. But...
I'm not gonna ask for specifics, but long as you're not looking to fill some sad sack with lead, that's good enough for me.
I'm not good at approaching people myself...
I'm not happy about this either.
I'm not lettin' anyone else have their pride\nor reason for living taken from them!
I'm not looking for a membership.|I've worked out there before.
I'm not lying! Shut the hell up! I'd never\nlie to anyone, especially not myself! I...\nI...!
I'm not proud to say it, but we should surveil this Motoha Arai before entering the Metaverse.
I'm not quite sated, but I've gotten enough\nof a taste. Your attacks are powerless\nagainst me now.
I'm not really good at speakin' my mind, but she's like the total opposite.
I'm not really sure, but I don't think he's\ngoing to be teaching classes.
I'm not really sure.
I'm not saying there isn't any value in this\nramenburger.
I'm not sensing any danger from this...\nCompanio. Am I correct in thinking you are\noffering this place to us?
I'm not so sure about that one. You're pretty\nodd, {NAME2}-chan.
I'm not so sure this is it. I can't imagine\nit would wear out very quickly...
I'm not sure Haruna will be\nconvinced until she hears it\nfrom him...
I'm not sure I could've managed if you\nhadn't been there!
I'm not sure if Chizuko is\nsaying something really\nprofound, or if she's just hammered...
I'm not sure if it'll really be useful to\nyou, but I feel like... I can play now.
I'm not sure if we'll be able to ensure\nKano's safety. I suggest we get out of the\nPalace as soon as possible.
I'm not sure myself, but this is another intuition that I have. I shall henceforth be known as Cattle.
I'm not sure what I should plant next,\nthough. Do you have any\nrecommendations, {NAME2}?
I'm not sure what happened, but I'm so happy\nto hear you say that. Thank you...
I'm not sure what he's asking.|What do I do next?
I'm not sure what it could be, but it's\nworth investigating.
I'm not sure what the best course of\naction is.
I'm not sure why. Maybe because I've finally\nmade a new music friend?
I'm not sure,
I'm not sure, but I just followed where\nit led me.
I'm not the classiest drinker, but it isn't\nthat easy to understand someone's true self.
I'm not the same as those Shadows\naround here. I came from the sea of\nthe human soul!
I'm not the type of person to get excited\nover the ambiance of a location, but I\ncould get used to this.
I'm not up for doing club stuff today...
I'm not up to anything. I just invited you to eat some ramen, geez.
I'm not very good with cats... Perhaps, you\nshould be the one to play with them.
I'm not worried about it. We've bumped into\neach other a few times before.
I'm nothing but a foolish, rotten,\nasinine... villain. I don't deserve to\nlive anymore...
I'm nothing special...
I'm now in a relationship\nwith Yumi...
I'm obviously joking. Besides, you don't need\na license to wear the coat.
I'm off to try somethin' new to develop my\npalate. Wanna tag along?
I'm off to try somethin' new. You comin'?
I'm on my way back from a run.\nAnd I didn't get lost this time!
I'm on register duty...
I'm only going with the plain one today\nthough. What flavor would you recommend,\n{NAME2}?
I'm only just remembering this, but wasn't\nthe last guy defending a Core like Kamoshida?
I'm overwhelemed by all the options. If you\nhave any ideas, I'd love to hear them!
I'm picturing a place filled with money.
I'm pierced by everyone's\nexpectant gazes...
I'm planning to go to the flower shop after\nthis. Would you mind coming along and giving\nme some advice?
I'm pleased to hear the notable improvement.
I'm pleased to say coach beamed at the sight\nof it. She even joked, "I wonder how much tea\nthis'll make."
I'm pretty tired. Better hurry home...
I'm proud of you! Keep up the good work!
I'm quite curious about that plum rice you\ntold me about earlier.
I'm ready to check out.
I'm ready to go whenever you are. Why don't\nwe drop by Mementos first?
I'm ready to pay.
I'm ready!|I'm busy right now.
I'm ready.|Leave it to me!
I'm really glad that Take-kun and I became\nfriends in the end.
I'm really glad we talked today. Now,\ndrink up!
I'm really glad you said yes to continuing the Phantom Thieves yesterday.
I'm really grateful for everything you've done.

I'm really happy to hear you say that!
I'm really impressed by how accomplished\neveryone here is.
I'm really no good with violence.\nHow's this?
I'm really sorry about this! At least I\ndidn't get the inside of your bag wet.
I'm really sorry for causing you so\nmuch trouble.
I'm really sorry for the sudden request.\nIf there's ever anything you're unsure about,\nfeel free to ask me anytime.
I'm really sorry, Russet.
I'm really worried.
I'm renting a room, but recently I've picked\nup so much stuff that it's getting pretty cramped.
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this blue record on the human heart...
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this green record on the human heart...
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this pink record on the human heart...
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this red record on the human heart...
I'm right behind you.|Just don't push yourself.
I'm right there with 'em. Searching for a\npurpose.
I'm rooting for you.|You've got this.
I'm ruined... I can never play again... Just take it.
I'm running my mouth, meanwhile having no clue what I actually want to do.
I'm scoping potential date spots.|Would your husband get jealous?
I'm sensing a powerful Shadow, Wonder!
I'm sensing an enemy...
I'm sensing an enemy... Be careful, Wonder.
I'm sleeping in my penthouse apartment, and\nwhen I wake up, my beautiful wife and\nchildren will be there...
I'm so ashamed of myself! I'm so sorry,\neveryone!
I'm so clueless, running over there in a\npanic could just make things worse.
I'm so excited. I feel like today's gonna be\nour best rehearsal yet!
I'm so glad that we can wear outdoor shoes\ninside at Kokatsu. Having to switch shoes\nall the time is such a hassle...
I'm so glad you joined our club, {NAME1}-kun!\nSee you next practice.
I'm so glad you were here with me,\n{NAME2}-kun.
I'm so grateful, {NAME1}-kun. Really...

I'm so happy to hear that! You know, I have\nyou to thank, too.
I'm so happy to hear you say that!
I'm so happy! I've actually wanted this for a\nlong time!
I'm so happy, I could almost cry. As a ramen\nchef, it fills me with great pride to see our\nultimate dish eaten with such delight.
I'm so happy. Thank you. But you can bet\nI'll be giving you something just as good\nin return!
I'm so not a Shadow that belongs here.\nI used to be in the humans' sea of souls...
I'm so pissed off!

I'm so sorry! I didn't think anyone was\nnearby!
I'm so sorry, Ms. Katayama!
I'm so sorry, everyone. We'll be closing up early today.
I'm so sorry, you guys... This is all\nbecause I went against Miyazawa...!
I'm so sorry. I... I really don't know what\nto do...
I'm so sorry. You even saved up all these\ntickets.
I'm so tempted to buy ice cream, but that\ndefinitely won't help me tone up. Gotta\nrefrain!
I'm sorry I got you guys involved in this.
I'm sorry about last time, I made things weird...
I'm sorry about that, {NAME2}-kun...
I'm sorry about that. Good thing you have\nsharp reflexes.
I'm sorry about the other day. I must have\nworried you.
I'm sorry for being selfish. Thanks for\nhumoring me.
I'm sorry for draggin' you guys into this...\nThanks for everything.
I'm sorry for not listening to you kids.
I'm sorry to bother you with this again...
I'm sorry to make you come all this way\nagain. I thought it best if we met somewhere\nfar from school.
I'm sorry too! You were worried about me, but\nI just acted like a brat and made\nthings worse.
I'm sorry young man, could you remind me\nwhat it was you were buying?
I'm sorry! This is something we just...\ncan't tell you!
I'm sorry, I didn't intend to eavesdrop,\nbut I just want to confirm...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to act like I know\nexactly what you're going through when I\ncouldn't possibly...
I'm sorry, I truly am. I'll refund you in full.
I'm sorry, Nishimori-san! Excuse us!
I'm sorry, Sensei.
I'm sorry, Shun-kun... I'm sorry to everyone\nat Victory Kitchen... I'm the real fake...
I'm sorry, but we're not open yet.
I'm sorry, it's not closing time yet.
I'm sorry, she always gets like this when\nsomething piques her interest.
I'm sorry, those Shadows surrounded me and\ntook me away... Who are those guys?
I'm sorry, we're closed today... Oh, it's you two...
I'm sorry, we're really busy today.
I'm sorry, you must be surprised getting\nspoken to like that out of nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't get in the way, did I?
I'm sorry. I know I invited you here, but I'm\nsuch a wreck...
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
I'm sorry. It isn't feasible, is it?\nI shouldn't have made such a big request\nso suddenly...
I'm sorry. It's just... I don't know what\nto do.
I'm sorry. Narumi-chan said she'll be a\nbit late.
I'm sorry. Tell me if she's becoming a\nnuisance, all right?
I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
I'm sorry. That was the only way I could\nthink to approach you.
I'm sorry. You took the time to come here,\nand now I'm talking to you about my life\nstory again.
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry... I didn't have any problems when\nI was in a band, but now...
I'm sorry... Motoha.
I'm sorry... Truly... I'll confess to\neverything. I'll make it all right again...
I'm sorry... everyone...
I'm starting to feel the day's exhaustion\ncatching up with me. I'd like to get home\nand lay down.
I'm starting to want to squish Mona's paws.\nMona? Monaaa? Is he not here?
I'm starving. Let's stop here for today.
I'm starving...
I'm still figuring out some bits, like the\noutro and the chords leading into the chorus.
I'm still flabbergasted you finished the\nUniverse-sized Ramen...
I'm still in my school uniform and all!\nI can't swing in this outfit.
I'm still not used to using my Persona,\nso I might hold everyone back. But still...
I'm still not very familiar with this place.\nWould you like to look around together?
I'm still nowhere near that level, but I want\nto make others feel the way I did that day.
I'm still training right now, but I'm sending\nresumes everywhere I can.
I'm still working on writing that song.\nIt's going slow, but it's going.
I'm struggling to gather\nmy thoughts...
I'm such an idiot! Do you think he's mad\nat me?
I'm suddenly feeling sleepy...
I'm super happy right now! You know, I've\nwanted something like this for a while!
I'm sure I would've gotten lost if you hadn't\nbeen here. I'm glad you came along.
I'm sure I'll figure it out. I've seen how\nothers do it!
I'm sure I'll learn something new. Let's\nhead over.
I'm sure I'll probably get lost again like\nI did today...
I'm sure good things will happen to you\nno matter what you do today.
I'm sure he had his reasons.|For you to learn something?|Let's think it over together.
I'm sure it'll be fun. Oh, but only adults\nare allowed in. I wonder if it'll be\nstreamed?
I'm sure it's a resentful spirit manifesting\nhere. Before it claims another victim,\nwe must...
I'm sure it's all fake, but imagine how much\nstuff you could buy if it wasn't.
I'm sure it's hard to believe. After all, I\nnever let myself trust you, Sensei.
I'm sure me being this way is why my grandchild doesn't trust me either...
I'm sure she's fine.|You're so kind, Tomoko.
I'm sure that's all she needs. As long as she\nhas that, it'll all work out...
I'm sure the change of heart was a factor, but this is likely due to us unsealing a new area of Mementos.
I'm sure the name of the clinic already gave\nit away, but I'm <color=#FF423F>Tae Takemi</color>.
I'm sure they're not able to cry their heart\nout at home, so they let their stress out\nhere.
I'm sure this isn't all that interesting to\nyou, but I actually grew up on a farm.
I'm sure this knowledge will come in handy\nwhen a customer comes asking for help!
I'm sure this shift will be a breeze for you.
I'm sure we'll find something really\ninteresting!
I'm sure you all remember the time when this shop was in crisis.
I'm sure you can figure out why.
I'm sure you could already guess, but...
I'm sure you didn't expect an adult, haha...
I'm sure you have your fair share of fears\nand concerns...
I'm sure you must have a lady friend or two!
I'm sure you will be duly compensated\nfor your efforts.
I'm sure you wouldn't mind earning a\nlittle extra?
I'm sure you'll be able to come up with your\nown takes on the recipe, {NAME2}-kun.
I'm sure you'll be able to help! Like, all\nthat stuff you taught me at the supermarket?\nSuper helpful!
I'm sure you'll be able to make up before\nyou graduate!
I'm sure you're just saying that to be nice,\nbut I'll accept the compliment. Thank you!
I'm surprised they haven't torn down these\nold apartments yet. Look at the state of 'em.
I'm surrounded by empty space\nas far as I can see. This must\nbe my free plot of land.
I'm surrounded by silence...
I'm talking about decrypting German codes\nduring the Second World War. Mathematicians\nplayed a huge role in that, you know.
I'm talking about the weapon that Soy uses\nin the Metaverse. I mean, a Gatling gun!?
I'm talking to you, Blondie and Frizzy Hair!
I'm tellin' ya, idols are cash cows. Fans\nwill sign their lives away for a single photo!
I'm tellin' you to scram!!
I'm telling you, I just can't.
I'm tempted, but we've gotta leave room for\nthe ramen.
I'm terrible with directions. Even if I use\nmy phone, I never end up where I need to be.
I'm the club's vice president. Since it's\nyour first day, I'll give you the rundown.
I'm the kind of gal who needs a sweet\npick-me-up when I'm tired, so I made it a\nlittle sweeter.
I'm the last person who should be saying\nthis, but you guys are such meatheads...
I'm the one who wants to change his heart the most, so...
I'm the type who can't wake up in the morning\nunless there's sunlight coming through the\nwindow.
I'm thinkin' a startin' up shop again.\nJust takin' down the closed notice.
I'm thinkin' of goin' with this, but what do\nyou think, {NAME2}?
I'm thinking about the next song I want to\nwrite too.
I'm thinking of meeting with Serizawa-san\ntoday. I've finished my new entry for the\ncompetition.
I'm thinking up a hard quiz.
I'm totally gonna date someone older!\nI'd love it if they had a kinda dark,\nmysterious vibe too.
I'm trying to come up with a new cocktail\nrecipe but nothing's coming to mind.
I'm trying to find an effective training method, so I thought I'd look it up.
I'm turning off the lights.
I'm unfortunately still preoccupied at the\nmoment, so I won't be able to meet with\nyou directly...
I'm up for a treasure hunt.|Maybe another time.
I'm used to walking now. Soon I should be\ngood to try running.
I'm useless. I can't hit anything!
I'm useless...
I'm usually in the library after school, but\nlet's trade contact info just in case.
I'm usually putting on shows with my puppet\nhere, but I've been thinking...
I'm very curious what young people are\nreading these days.
I'm visiting my folks back home in the\ncountryside tomorrow.
I'm with you all the way.|If I have to.|Of course!
I'm working on a recording of the song from\nlast time. Want to hear it when it's done?
I'm worried about Riko-senpai... What if she\nwas attacked on the subway and injured?
I'm worried everyone at school's probably been talking about me.
I'm worried that you might still have some\nproblem you're dealing with.
I'm worried.|I don't know.
I'm your heart's undying justice!
I'm your monja mentor.|Nothing but the best for you.
I'm your neighbor. Wow, you've really grown\nup since the last time I saw you. I've seen\nyour mom a few times here and there.
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|Don't mind me.
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|I'd rather not say...
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|My name's not worth knowing.
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|Nice to meet you.
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|You don't need to know.
I'm, uh, Kiyoshi Kurotani... currently a\nchosen one.
I'm, uh... Well... Actually, I'm sorry\nI brought this up, forget I said anything...
I'm... actually not so good with those kinds\nof movies.
I'm... fine, I guess.
I'm... inside the caf\xe9?\nFor some reason... it feels\na bit like the Metaverse.
I'm... sorry about that.
I'm... too tired... Please... let me rest...
I've actually seen the show before. Miyazawa\ncompetes with chefs who've disputed\nhis reviews.
I've already given you much to think about, however, we are hoping for your success.
I've already got a request...

I've always been bad with that sort of thing.\nI make one fielding error, and I just can't\nget back on track.

I've always just written my name in cursive\nas best I could...
I've always liked my brothers and respected\nthem. I even cheered them on at nationals.

I've always wanted somewhere to play\nbaseball near my house!
I've always wanted to come, but a\nplanetarium's not the easiest place to visit\non your own.
I've always wondered why the word for\n"disciplinary committee" uses the kanji\nfor wind.
I've always worn glasses, so I think I'd\nfeel kinda weird going out without them.
I've arranged a special training for you tomorrow. We'll be going to Mementos.
I've arrived in\nHarvest World Online.
I've asked him as much before, and he said\neverything was fine.
I've barely spoken to him before, but I'm\npretty sure he's in Class D with Tomoko...\nOh yeah, his name's <color=#FF423F>Shun Kano</color>.
I've become acquainted with\nthe orange tabby. I should\nlook for him again sometime.
I've been all wrong from the start. I only\never thought about acting like a cool hero.
I've been bustin' my chops to give y'all the\nbest customer experience I could... I guess\nthis ain't what y'all were lookin' for...
I've been coming here to check out the odd\noutlet or boutique lately.
I've been curious about this for quite some\ntime. In this world of withering desire...
I've been curious about this place for a\nwhile...
I've been doing my best to function on my own\never since she quit, but...

I've been hearing about this little scam of yours! I swear, the cops are useless!
I've been in a long-distance relationship\nwith my girlfriend, but we haven't had a\nchance to meet up at all.
I've been lookin' forward to seein' you\ncome by here!
I've been looking for you.
I've been meeting up with\nChizuko at this jazz club a\nfew times now, but...
I've been pigging out a little too much on\nthe staff meals at the beach house...
I've been roped into helping them prepare\na few things...
I've been saving up money for my daughter,\nand I really don't want to dip into\nthose savings...

I've been told by Pops a number of times\nI have to listen to other people's opinions\nmore.
I've been training quite a while now, but\nof course I'm still nowhere near pro level.
I've been trying my hand at a bunch, but\ncould use a second opinion... Most people\nhere only order alcohol, you see.
I've been waiting for someone like you.\nA chosen one, guided by destiny.
I've been wantin' to try this ramen shop for\nforever now.
I've been wondering what job might suit me,\nbut I haven't followed up on it...

I've had enough! This time I'm quitting!\nI'm not playing games anymore! This\ngoddamn job...!

I've had someone who loves me for me\nall along!
I've had this tsukemen at the main chain.\nIt's one of my personal favorites.

I've investigated further since last time,\nand it's clear Take isn't drinking that\njuice.

I've never tasted anything\nlike this... The aroma is\nmaking my head spin...
I've never written lyrics or anything before,\nso I don't know how long it'll take.
I've no inkling of what this may yield, but\nlet's pass through it and see what happens.
I've noticed something rather disquieting\nduring our recent explorations.
I've noticed that you never fail to greet me\nwhenever we cross paths. You really are a\npolite one.
I've only been thinking of winning lately...
I've only got Mandrin, so that ain't\ntoo bad...
I've only really scratched the surface.
I've prepared <color=#FF423F>three goals</color> for each test.\nBe careful\u2014there are rewards on the line.
I've realized that I don't really have the\ndrive to win this thing, you know?
I've reported you to my private security company!
I've seen her before! Outside the theater in\nYongen-Jaya, practically swimming in cats!
I've seen lots of people acting self-involved\nlately. Being inconsiderate to the people\naround them and that kind of thing.
I've seen pictures of their food online. The\ntoppings were a little unusual.
I've seen the Hit-and-Run Rider...|When did she start doing it?
I've seen this on TV.|It's kind of sleazy.
I've seen you around school a few times too.
I've seen you at school, but this is\nthe first time we've really spoken.
I've seen your face around here a lot lately.\nSo what's your name, pal?
I've spotted another camera.
I've successfully infiltrated Sensei's subconscious!\nNow to find the answers to the test...
I've thought about it a lot since we talked, {NAME1}-kun.
I've tried everythin' I could to get a few\nmore, but... I've not had any luck.
I've um... found a part-time job. I thought\nwe could check it out together maybe?
I've wanted to be a nurse ever since I was little. So hearing that makes me happy.
I've wanted to do this since way before I\never started baseball.
I've yet to explain that bit to {NAME2}-kun too. Now's as good a time as any.
I've, uh, never actually been over to a guy's\nhouse before... Hahaha...
I, Hiromu Miyazawa, for the cruel and\ninsensitive conduct I have perpetrated\nagainst several restaurants...
I, I don't...
I, I...
I, for one, am definitely in favor of Motoha's plan. It would be much safer searching in a group than alone.
I, for one, have never once fought by\nthrowing an umbrella before.
I, myself, never thought I'd end up looking\nanything like this.
I, too, feel at peace here.
I, too, have had a lot of trouble with\ninterpersonal relationships in the past.
I, um, tripped and then... Well, everything\nin my briefcase went flying all over the\nplace... *sniffle*
I, um, wanted to spend some quality time with\nyou as well.
I, um...
I, um... I don't come to shops like this a\nlot. Sports shops, sure. Well, back before...\nYou know... Haha.
I, um... seem to have lost my phone...
I-I am doing no such thing!
I-I can't believe my eyes... You truly\ndevoured that ramen behemoth!
I-I can't do this!
I-I can't really sing today...
I-I did get kind of sweaty from gym today... Ahahah...
I-I made it with some friends, so I guess I\nwrote it myself, in a way?
I-I mean, I couldn't very well just be like\n"Hey, can I come over?"
I-I most certainly do not! This is purely for\nthe purpose of investigation.
I-I must have dropped it somewhere...!\nI'm so, so sorry...!
I-I see...
I-I suppose so?
I-I work for a company that sells expensive\nhealth equipment at horrendous prices.
I-I'd better check it out... I c-can't just\nrun away like a coward.
I-I'll have a water...|What else do you have?
I-I'm collecting... donations... to help cats... But um...
I-I'm fine!
I-I'm leaving you in charge! Punish those intruders nice and good! You hear me!?
I-I'm not in charge of her class though...
I-I'm not into it!
I-I'm not scared of your threats! If you're\ngonna hit me, go ahead and try it!
I-I'm sorry!
I-I'm sorry! Please excuse me, sir.
I-I'm sorry, Pops... I lost it again...
I-I'm sorry, sir... I believe you've been\ntold that you're banned from this store.
I-I'm sorry. I...
I-I'm sorry... I... umm...
I-I'm startin' to get hungry again! Time for\nanother parfait!
I-I'm... I'm Kurotani-kun's friend, too!
I-I-I really l-like you...!
I-I...
I-If that's true, it makes me really happy...
I-If the two of us face off like this, I'm\nnot sure my destiny powers will really\nactivate...
I-Inexplicable!?
I-Is this...? Wow, you really pegged me down\nto a T!
I-Isn't this bad?
I-It'll be okay, Tomoko. Don't give up. Everything is going to get better, I promise you.
I...
I... I can't play baseball anymore...?
I... I can't take this... anymore...
I... I killed them. I'm a murderer!
I... I see your point. This sort of\nconversation does make us sound like a\ncouple of newlyweds...
I... I sense I've made a grave miscalculation in how to start this conversation!
I... I suppose we can still make this work.\nAs a warrior of the dark, I welcome you as my\nally of the light.
I... I'll...
I... I'm <color=#72C5FF>Sudama</color>!
I... I'm not afraid of anything...
I... I'm so happy, I'm lost for words...\nBut seriously... Thank you!
I... I, I, I...!
I... No way! I'm gonna walk after this and\nburn it all off.
I... We... We all did what we thought was\nthe right thing.
I... can't. I don't have the skill to teach any\u2014
I... did...
I... did...?
I... don't really know.
I... may've met them before.|I have no memory of them.
I... see...
I... still want to hang out with Shota-kun.
I...!
ID photos? What on earth could they identify?
IT BUUURRRNNNSSS!
I\u2014
I\u2014!
Ichiryusai Madarame, as his apprentice.
Ideally, we would've scored early and then defended the lead to the end...
Idioms like that can seem kind of random...
Idle anticipation is more formidable a foe\nthan fear. Now then...
Idol magazines in particular have contributed\ngreatly to the concept of Phantom Idols.
Idols again?|Not even once.|So do you just like idols then?
Idols do not display their emotions freely.\nThey hide their true feelings behind a\nsmile... a mask.
If Akashi hadn't shown up, we wouldn't have\nhad to fight her!
If I can be an asset to the team, I'll rest easy.
If I can't find someone willing to\nparticipate in the experiment soon, I...
If I can't stay awake, I'm gonna miss out on\nthose super limited-edition bonuses...
If I change people's hearts, then I can help\neveryone who's lost their desires like I did.
If I couldn't get us a new member, we would've had to disband.
If I die, there will be no one left to answer your questions anyway.
If I don't hurry, I'll be\nlate for school. Better\nget dressed.
If I don't keep studying, I feel like she'll\njust get further and further away from me.
If I don't narrow things down a bit first,\nthe cost of ingredients can get quite high.
If I don't take this seriously, there's no\nway she'll hear me out.
If I ever find that Slammer, I'll punch his\nlights out! What kind of creep targets girls\nlike that!?
If I find a book that's useful, I'm gonna check it out.
If I go to Shibuya, I might\nbe able to see Matsukata.\nMaybe I'll go soon.
If I had even some tech knowledge, maybe I\ncould learn to manipulate computer systems\nlike you, Oracle?
If I had seeds, I could plant\nthings in the garden...
If I had to guess, I'd say I was missing\nsomething from the start.
If I had to guess, what Wind said to Katayama\nin that bar...
If I have to make some cheap knockoff\nthen... Entering this fight was pointless in\nthe first place!
If I keep this up, I think things should\nwork out!
If I keep this up, I'll be knocking 'em out\nin no time!
If I know it, I'll sing it for you. I've been\nmaking you listen to my feelings all\nthe time.
If I let her go on her own,\nI don't think she'll ever find\nher way...
If I log on now, Yui probably\nwon't be there, though...
If I may offer a suggestion...
If I may speak, you appear ready to\nface a trial.
If I may, I'd first just like to say a few words on behalf of the group...
If I open this chest, that\nwill end our investigation of\nthis area...
If I read a little every day and think over\nthe meaning, I'll finish it sooner or later.
If I remember correctly, that door had an unusually large lock on it.
If I remember right, {NAME2}, aren't your\nparents traveling now?
If I say, "Thank you," it means you win.\nSimple, right?
If I sell now, all my investments will be\nfor nothing... But if I don't sell, I've got\nno cash left...
If I sneak in there the night before and\nleave the calling card, then...
If I squint really hard, you almost have a fierce look about you.
If I start now, I'll get a\nfree plot of land.
If I talk to him now, he might end up feeling more guilty, and I don't want to put him through that.
If I thought it'd actually make my life\neasier, I'd be all for it.
If I told my parents I wanted a pet owl, they'd never allow it.
If I turn away now and pretend this never happened...
If I want to be loved... No.
If I want to be treated with respect, I have\nto become worthy of my title.
If I want to, I can keep\nfulfilling her requests and\naccompany her.
If I win, you join my baseball team.
If I'd had to deal with this on my own,\nI would've stewed over it until I ended up\nspitting out some half-hearted apology.
If I'm a client now...
If I'm already blabberin' this much, the\nramen is probably gonna be out of this world.
If I'm going to have a happy future playing\nthe sport I love, then everyone else needs a\nhappy future too!
If I'm gonna play alongside you, I need to\npractice a hell of a lot more.
If I'm not mistaken, it has something to do\nwith the <color=#FF423F>Shadow next to it</color>.
If I'm shooting Shinjuku, I want to capture\nthat Shinjuku vibe... But if it's too clich\xe9,\nit's boring.
If Motoha Arai comes back to baseball, then\nthere's still hope!
If Ms. Katayama's desire is to support\nher students...
If a customer asks for bold flowers that\nconvey love, what would you pick out\nfor them?
If a human without a Persona gets lost in the Metaverse, they're sure to fall victim to wandering Shadows.
If a job interests you, add it to your\nscheduled activities.
If a monjayaki restaurant is this good,\na shop specializing in ramen has big shoes\nto fill.
If a parent consistently ignores calls from\ntheir child's teacher, it can be indicative\nof problems at home.
If a teacher were to delete a video, there\nwould be allegations of a cover-up.
If a young person ever comes to me for help\nagain, I'm going to handle it a lot better.
If all goes well, I was hoping we'd come across them, but...
If anything occurs, I expect it to be when\nthe juice is put out for sale.
If anything, I just wish I had someone\nto run with.
If anything, the true source of your power\nlies in your own desires.
If anything, we should try not to get too\ninvested in the outcome of our first\ncompetition.
If by some chance you manage to win, I'll stop going after your precious little shops.
If by some reason one's desires become\ncorrupted, their Shadow will run amok.
If desire alters the shape of a species, who\nknows what form future humans might take.
If even you harbor uncertainty, then such\nknowledge must be beyond my comprehension.
If everything's ready, let's start making\nthe curry.
If favored, even a thief can become a hero.\nI'm sure you've all heard the term\n"righteous thief."
If fiends like Kiuchi are pushing people to the brink of despair...
If food is art... then I feel like having a\nbetter understanding of art might help me\ndevelop my palette...
If going there brings back bad memories for you, we can totally just forget about it, okay?
If he's a reserve team member, maybe he'd\nappear if the regular first basemen is gone?
If he's feeling that enervated, shouldn't he\nsimply rest? I fail to understand...
If her Shadow disappears, it should return\nto the real Katayama.
If his homelife is the cause of his issues\nat school, then it's up to us teachers\nto intervene!
If idols indeed possess multiple Personas\nlike you, there is much we can learn\nfrom them.
If it behooves you, you might consider procuring restorative healing goods vital to our mission while you're there.
If it is as you say, then so be it. Perhaps\nanother time then.
If it is to find fulfillment, then perhaps\nwatching movies is, in itself, an act of\ndesire.
If it is, then maybe getting older isn't so\nbad after all.
If it means making less work for us, then\nyou're more than welcome. Right,\nMs. Katayama?
If it was just us, I could deal. We barely\ntry anyway.
If it were just me, I would've been\noverworking myself non-stop.
If it were me...
If it were you, which method would\nyou chose?
If it's a quiet and calm place, you can study and read efficiently.
If it's all right with you, could we work\ntogether again sometime?
If it's all right with you, {NAME1}-kun,\nwould you mind coming to work with me again\nsometime?
If it's all right with you... Could you stay\nand watch, maybe?
If it's built the same way, can we get to\nthe second floor from <color=#FF423F>outside the gates</color>?
If it's coming from here, then that means...
If it's math, then yeah! High school math is\nso fun! It's just like solving a puzzle!
If it's not Kamoshida's Palace, and it's not\nKiuchi's either... then where are we?
If it's okay with you, I'd love to hear what\nkind of art you like, too.
If it's okay with you, could you help me find\nmy ideal flavors ?
If it's okay with you, do you think you could\nstay and watch like last time?
If my evaluation is correct, then this is...
If my mom were still here, she wouldn't just leave him like this.
If needed, the school counselor and other\nqualified professionals should deal with\nthe situation.
If nothing is done, the students of this\nschool will fall prey to the forces of\ndarkness.
If one gets too worn out, then I only have\ntwo left...
If our challenger can safely guide King\nRobo to the hacking site, he wins!
If our true identities get revealed, we're\nfinished. It's too risky for many reasons...
If people back then had decided that chilis\nweren't a proper Sichuan seasoning, well...
If she doesn't wanna hang out with us, she\nshould just say so.
If she doesn't want people talking about\nhow it is or isn't useful, why does she bring\nit up?
If she hadn't brought me into the band,\nI don't think I'd be who I am today.
If she was lying, her muscles would be\ncackling up a storm, not feeling relieved.
If she's got repressed anger she can only\nlet out by pullin' risky stunts in secret...
If so
If someone gives up on all of their desires\nor has them stolen, what do you think would happen to that person?
If someone has become the new energy source,\nthey're most likely at the "power plant"...
If someone points a phone at them and says\nthey're recording, the teachers run off.
If someone prepared something special\nfor me...
If someone was in trouble, she'd help them in a heartbeat. Kind of like a comic book hero.
If something happens, turn to Mr. Akashi or\nTanemura-kun! Are we clear!?
If something is holding you back, removing it\nis the first step toward good health!
If something's upsetting him, he should say so! But he's always trying to act tough, so...
If that hallway remains a threat, I don't\nthink anyone will come disturb her.
If that happens, I'll be the one to deal with\nit next time!
If that surge of power persists, Katayama's\nmind won't survive!
If that video goes public, his future will\nbe ruined. I'll talk to the TV station.
If that was the case, she could've just\nbroken up the band and not abandoned\nmusic entirely...
If that's how it's gonna be...
If that's how you feel about it though, maybe\nyou're right.
If that's our plan, then we ought to hurry.
If that's settled, let us hurry to bed.\nWe'll want to be sharp for tomorrow!
If that's the case, I'd better brush up on\nmy studies myself.
If that's the case, would you help me\nobtain more information?
If that's too hard for you to understand, you\nshould resign. There's a horde of people\ntripping over themselves for your spot.
If that's true, then why didn't anyone bring\nthis to my attention before?
If that's what you desire.|That depends on you.
If that's your problem, you'd be better off finding someone younger than you!
If the band gets too serious and stops being\nfun, then what's the point, right!?
If the fence is electrified, there must be a\npower source somewhere...
If the kid who picked a fight with Miyazawa\nis a Kokatsu student, we'd have the scoop!
If the matter intrigues you, I would suggest\ntaking action. It will likely prove\nanother way to strengthen your desire.
If the mechanisms are the same, moving the\ngreen-marked boxes into their correct places\nwill resolve this.
If the other guys see us cooperating, they'll probably start thinking of doing the same with you.
If the world refuses to bring Kiuchi's actions under scrutiny...
If there are Shadows here, that means they're\nguarding something valuable, right?
If there are, I'd love to meet them and\nlearn more! At least if they're as\nfriendly as you.
If there was delivery, I'd go broke in\na week! I'd recommend it to my family, too!
If there's anything else you want to know,\njust ask. I'd be happy to share what I can.
If there's anything you're uncertain about,\nyou can always reach out to me.
If there's anything you're willing to part\nwith, I'll gladly take it off your hands.
If there's somebody you admire that you wish\nyou could change into , just use that machine\nover there!
If there's two Cores, does that mean we need\nto steal both to get outta here?
If they allow me to understand you, I shall\nsay I do not hate them.
If they have meat dishes, I'd love to join you, however...
If they sell fertilizer, they must know a lot\nabout pests too! Good thinking!
If they're really gonna call the cops, we\nshould get away from here ASAP, right?
If they're somebody powerful, or part of\nsome big organization, we won't stand a\nchance against them.
If things continue like this, it's just going\nto get worse for you. Are you okay with that?
If things had gone well for him, do ya think\nhe'd have turned out differently...?
If things keep goin' like this, I reckon\nwe're headed for a whole heap of trouble...
If this goes on much longer, she'll completely break down...
If this is anything like before, stealing\nthis Palace's Core will allow us to escape.
If this is to be our <color=#FF423F>base of operations</color> for\nnurturing hope, I would prefer it have a\nsplash of color...
If this trade is obstructed, well then...\nLet's take a look at 18th-century France.
If this was a Palace, I suppose that means\nhe saw his pupils as his own blank canvases,\nthen...
If this... mastermind truly is orchestrating\nthings behind the scenes, it would be logical\nto assume that we may be on their radar.
If true, then this place would\nappear to reflect one's own\nperception of reality...
If we activate the Metaverse Navigator from\nanywhere else, there's no way to know where\nin Mementos we might end up.
If we all have fake money, most of it will be\ntaken back. In short...
If we all have the counterfeit bills, most\nof them will be taken back. In short...
If we attack him with an attribute he\nremembers, he'll just absorb it.
If we can aid them in making their choices,\nthey may be able to find their way again...
If we can completely cover him in it\u2014!
If we can open it
If we can pull this off, just imagine...\nYakitori delivery!
If we can't go back, let's keep movin'\nforward. Maybe we'll find a hint in the Palace.
If we can't go through here, we'll have to go\nand search someplace else.
If we cut that cable, we can free her from\nAkashi's control!
If we destroy his Shadow completely by mistake, there's a chance the real Kiuchi could die.
If we did, I'd join the Explorer Club!
If we don't take care of Kiuchi, people like her will continue having their will to live stripped away from them.
If we ever end up fighting together in the\nMetaverse, it might be fun to try it out.
If we ever meet again, let's play some more!
If we find any similar devices later, we\nshould be sure to use them. Don't forget that\noperation command!
If we get out of here safe, dinner's on me.\nAs thanks for saving Wonder.
If we get you three chains, you'll be able\nto fix it?
If we go back, we'll run into Akashi's\ncognitive form. We have to press ahead,\nWonder!
If we go in through the <color=#FF423F>window above the\ncastle gate</color>, we can get right on top of 'em!
If we had defeated it, Katayama's feelings\ntoward Akashi in real life may have changed,\nbut...
If we happen to come across the Core while\nwe're looking for them, we can just snatch\nit up.
If we leave things as they are, this space\nwill eventually overtake all of Mementos...
If we let him get away with this, how many more people do you think will end up hurt!?
If we manage to steal it, we can induce a change of heart in Kiuchi.
If we need to do any shopping, we should get it done before we go. So, are you ready to send the calling card?
If we pull that chain, it should raise the\ngrate!
If we refuse their invitation, the\nShadows around us may react\nviolently.
If we steal it, and the worst happens...\nyou might not want to be a teacher anymore.
If we use our real names, it might have an effect on their cognition...
If we use this, we may be able to get\nall the way over there!
If we want to be as thorough as possible, we\ncould go there first. It's up to Wonder.
If we want to go further, we'll need to\ndefeat this one.
If we were to confront him here, there is a possibility that he'll fly into a rage and endanger everyone in the vicinity.
If we were to use this wind... We just might\nbe able to <color=#FF423F>fly to the other side</color>.
If we'd defeated that Akashi-lookin'\nShadow... Could we have prevented this?
If we're all set, let's get those cameras\nrolling! The show's about to begin!
If we're attacked, we'll hit 'em right back!
If we're looking to broaden our range of battle tactics, firearms are the way to go.
If we're making it official, we should decide\non a <color=#FF423F>leader</color> too. I guess that'd be you, right, {NAME2}-kun?
If we're obviously acting cautious, it'll\nlook suspicious.
If we've reached an understanding, then\nplease be on your way.
If what the Shadows were saying is correct,\nit should be able to wipe out the <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>.
If writing is the greatest human invention,\nbooks must embody our species' sapience!
If ya ever need a hand, just gimme a beep.
If ya go out and create many memories with\nyour friends, sugar, perhaps we'll have\nsomethin' to display here!
If you "make justice manifest," what happens\nto my friends?
If you are interested, you've really gotta\ntry it. You're bound to love it!
If you ask Masa, he can get it for ya. Could\nyou two give it to Shun for me?
If you ask Ren, I'm sure he'll make it\nfor you, so please enjoy your order...\nor something along those lines.
If you ask me, this place is a lot like them\nPalaces you've been to\u2014it's got that\nsame energy.
If you beg your mommies and daddies,
If you burn for revenge, I will gladly\nfulfill that desire...
If you buy a new bag, do be sure it's one\nI'll fit in!
If you can't write it down... You could try\nto remember it using mnemonics or examples.
If you catch a cold wandering around in the\nrain, you could spread it to other people.
If you could avoid burdening him with your\nresponsibilities, we in the faculty would\nprobably have a higher opinion of you.
If you could be there when I do.
If you do get your hands on some items like\nthat, you bring them back here.
If you do have an interest, I urge you to\ngive it a shot. We welcome new members\nwith open arms!
If you do not mind, might I inquire about\nyour situation?
If you do, I'm gonna have to jump in there after you.
If you don't get a reading you can't protect yourselves! My predictions always come true!
If you don't have a book to read, why not\ntry meditation? It can help you clear your\nmind, and you'll find it has many benefits.
If you don't know the meaning of certain\nwords either, that's also helpful information\nfor me.
If you don't mind, I hope you'll keep lending\nan ear, {NAME2}.
If you don't mind, could we ask you for\nyour help?
If you don't want to do this anymore,\nthen don't.
If you ever meet with Musubi again, try to\ngive her some encouragement.
If you ever run into her, tell me what she's\nlike! Inquiring minds want to know.
If you ever see me around, don't hesitate\nto say hey!
If you ever want to build a PC, feel free\nto ask me for advice anytime!
If you ever want to talk muscles with me,\ncome by any time!
If you feel underprepared, we could always return to the real world and stock up on whatever items we need.
If you find accepting ruin unbearable, you'll do well to remain on the winning side at all costs.
If you finish it, the greatest honor and\ncash prize will be yours!
If you get tired of life in the city, it may\nbe good to get some fresh air.
If you guys don't get stronger, I won't stand\na chance of getting further in Mementos!
If you hadn't defied me, everything would\nhave worked itself out!
If you have a message, I can relay it to her\nwhen she comes back.
If you have any feedback, please do not\nhesitate to tell me.
If you have any questions about the sheet\nmusic, feel free to ask me.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate\nto ask!
If you have any questions, just say the word!
If you have any sense at all, you'll turn\ntail and flee this place!
If you have even a shred of dignity, you'd get back out on the field and prove them wrong.
If you have some time, why not see\nfor yourself?
If you have the time, do you think you could come play with them again?
If you have time, I was thinking it'd be fun\nto jam together again.
If you have time, I was thinking it'd be fun\nto jam together again...
If you have time, I'd like you to take a\nlook. I believe at least a cursory\ninvestigation would be prudent.
If you imagine the real world as one side of\na coin, Mementos exists in perfect parallel\non the opposite side.
If you insist on making a fuss about this...
If you insist, well... By all means, lead\nthe way.
If you insist...|I'd love to!
If you join now, you can attend\nthe next handshake event for free!
If you make someone like him think you're a\nuseful pawn, he won't turn on you.
If you pay too much attention to one\nstudent, you'll end up neglecting the others,\nwon't you?
If you prove what you're doing is just,
If you really think about it, it's more like\nAkashi stole Katayama-san's desire, huh?
If you recall, I didn't get to see the\nnumber! I was inside Wonder's bag!
If you say so, then very well. But we should\nremain cautious.

In truth, I've lost my ID countless\u2014 I mean,\na few times before.
In truth, it is a throne where desires and\nlove clash, and relationships are formed.
In which case it'd be great if you could\nshow me the way. Anyway, later!
In which case, if I may be so bold, I will\nupgrade our agreement to a special contract.

Incredible! Even mountains would succumb to\nyour moving tenor!
Incredible...
Indeed I am! Here, take this. It's all the\nfine print!
Indeed it does. We ought to keep it in\nour possession, just in case.
Indeed she is.
Indeed we are. You've both become much\nstronger, so I'm confident we'll have that\nTreasure soon.
Indeed, but there's no sign of a key here.\nWe should return to the west wing for now.
Indeed, in cases like this...
Indeed, it does seem dangerous, but I sense\nthat we are getting closer to the Treasure.\nWe have made good progress.
Indeed, it was penned by none other than\nKi no Tsurayuki.
Indeed, looking upon the state of this place may cause you to conclude as much.
Indeed, that is our best option. You've\nbecome quite the florist.
Indeed, we do, but all this talk of food is\nmaking me rather famished. I've had nothing\nbut warm water all day.
Indeed, which makes it a hot topic. Anyone\nactually drinking it is bound to draw\nattention.
Indeed, you are now quite adept at this.
Indeed.
Indeed. A moment's negligence here, and we\ncould be stripped of all we have.
Indeed. And I believe I know where it can\nbe found. If we just head there and\ntake it...
Indeed. And you remember what happens to a person once all of their hope's been stolen from them, right, {NAME2}?
Indeed. Better to form an attack plan before\napproaching it.
Indeed. Ever since people started talking\nabout these incidents, the town has gotten\nstranger and stranger.
Indeed. I am glad that you remember.
Indeed. I cannot turn a blind eye to such an\nunderhanded scheme.
Indeed. I have a feeling this will not be\nso simple after all.
Indeed. I have already forged strong\nconnections with several shop owners.
Indeed. I have high hopes for both you\nand Naruru.
Indeed. I thought at first that Kiuchi's\nPalace may have changed, but no...
Indeed. If I may be so bold, I would like to\nact as your personal employee.
Indeed. If I may be so bold, I would like to\nact as your personal fave.
Indeed. If it's not too much trouble for\nyou, could we exchange contact information?
Indeed. It seems that simply blinding it\nwon't be sufficient.
Indeed. It's good to see that you're well.
Indeed. Just as idols have tacit\nrestrictions, fans must follow their own\ncode of conduct as well.
Indeed. Let's go back and think of another\nway to get into the west building.
Indeed. Let's return and give it a try.
Indeed. Next to the Velvet Room, this\nmarketplace is like a second home to me.
Indeed. Now our next targets are Katayama\nand Akashi.
Indeed. Other twisted desires must have\nshaped this place into a similarly vulgar\nstate.
Indeed. Perhaps our old friends have already\nbeat us inside...
Indeed. So we can look for the Core on our\nown without having to worry about him.
Indeed. That's the correct gift, to be sure.
Indeed. There may be similar treasure chests\nelsewhere, though. Let's look around.
Indeed. There must be something\nimportant nearby...
Indeed. These Shadows are one part of how humanity's desires are being stolen.
Indeed. These Shadows...
Indeed. These moments must have had a deep\nimpact on her.
Indeed. We'll need to proceed with extreme\ncaution to avoid getting hit.
Indeed. Well done, team.
Indeed... But there surely must be a way\nin somewhere.
Indeed... In that case, why don't we call it\na <color=#FF423F>Core</color>? For the time being, at least.
Indeed... Let us search the room for now.
Indeed... Time for more trial and error, then.\nGood luck, Wonder.
Indeed... We've seen palaces take different\nforms, but this one sounds like a movie pitch.
Indeed... You're right. Until we meet again,\nQueen.
Indirect actions of great figures like\nGentileschi empowered everyday people to push\nfor the establishment of human rights.
Inexcusable... I can't believe you'd even\nbegin to think of me and that sorry excuse\nfor a cat as one and the same!
Infiltration successful! Now on to the west\nwing. Careful, now.

Instant foods, rain gear, and hot drinks are\n20% off.
Instant ramen, a plastic umbrella, and hot\ncoffee. These are all on sale.
Instead of Riko-senpai, shouldn't the faculty\nbe dealing with these problems in the\nfirst place?
Instead of looking at the map as top versus\nbottom, it's better to think upstream versus\ndownstream.
Instead of thinking of it like training,\nI should just have fun.
Instead of trying to snag a win with a wild\nidea, I'd rather you give us an entry that\nshows us what you've learned.
Instead of worrying about that, I suggest you start thinking about your next career path.
Instead, I put enough effort into it for the\nboth of us!
Instead, we use the verb "marry." Like in\nthe clich\xe9 phrase used during a proposal.

Is this...!? What an exceptional masterpiece\u2014\nit checks all of my boxes.
Is your health okay?|You must be excited.
Is your owner around?|Must be a stray...
Isn't a Palace like... a representation of\nhow its twisted ruler sees the world?
Isn't it about time you let me in on this\nsurprise?
Isn't it boring? You know, unless you're\nreally into the stars or something.
Isn't it cool!
Isn't it good enough that he's behind bars?
Isn't it kinda... red?|Don't tell me it's spicy.|Is this taco-flavored?
Isn't it wonderful? I bought it in town!
Isn't she a Phantom Thief now?
Isn't she important to you?|I thought you liked her.
Isn't that Ayaka's friend? How long has she\nbeen here?
Isn't that exactly what's going on at school\nright now?
Isn't that right, Joker?
Isn't that right, Merope?
Isn't that the peculiar-looking Shadow we\nsaw earlier?
Isn't that...
Isn't there an amusement park over there?\nSomething-or-other-polis?
Isn't there anything else you want to do?\nWant to be?
Isn't there something off about this? It's\nlike the treasure's begging to be stolen!
Isn't this ball the same kind they had on\ndisplay in that case?
Isn't this great, Haruna-chan!?
Isn't this place kinda like a nightclub?\nOmigosh, this is so rad!
Isn't this the man the Phantom Thieves sent a calling card for?
Isn't this too over-the-top? It's like we're\nin an old TV drama.
It actually had something to do with you...
It actually made him popular for a while.\nBut I guess pull back the curtain and he's\njust a regular, rotten Menace.
It all rushes straight across the land,\ncreating a flash flood.
It all started when one of my colleagues\nmade a mistake and then disappeared into\nthin air.
It also reflects the "mental state" of those\nwho visit it.
It also said "preconceptions are\nmisdirections." Do you feel like you gained\nany <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> from that?
It always rains the one time I don't bring\nan umbrella.
It always waves when my friends and I\nare exploring!
It appears I am mistaken. The intricacies of\nhuman emotion still remain quite the enigma\nto me.
It appears I spoke too soon. This one is some\nsort of Glitch amalgamation.
It appears as though another exhibition room\nis hidden behind this painting.
It appears as though it can only be opened\nfrom the inside.
It appears as though it's linked to Kiuchi.\nYet it's in this makeshift version of\nKamoshida's Palace?
It appears as though the reception room's\nshutter has been locked.
It appears crafting those infiltration tools\nyesterday improved your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
It appears lightning has struck.
It appears so. We should return to\nthe vault's entrance as soon as we check its\ncontents. Is that acceptable?
It appears that talking Shadow calls the\nshots around here.
It appears that using this dummy as a\nsparring partner would allow you attain\na full-body workout.
It appears that your refined approach has\nfurther honed your <sprite=4><color=#ffb400>Proficiency</color>.
It appears the change of heart was successful.
It appears the first wave of customers is\napproaching. Let's concentrate on our work.
It appears there's a storage area and an\nelevator ahead. Let's keep going, Wonder.
It appears there's a surveillance room ahead.\nLead the way, Wonder.
It appears to be a gallery. The exit\ncontinues to elude us...
It appears to be a giant safe. A typical\ncognition for a man obsessed with money.
It appears to be different from before.
It appears to be high-temperature steam...\nWe can't enter through here. We'll have to\nfind a different way.
It appears to be related to Kiuchi. We should\ntake this with us just in case.
It appears we can get through now.
It appears you're seeing things... Perhaps you're still exhausted from yesterday's excitement.
It appears you've hit upon something.
It benefits both sides, and seems credible\n enough. What should we do, {NAME2}?
It can be dangerous running on those,\nyou know! But the added challenge\nmotivates me.
It can be fun just standing here like this.\nYou see a lot of interesting things.
It can get a bit overwhelming, but it's nothing\nyou can't handle. I say go for it.
It can't end like this.|Third time's the charm!
It certainly does look identical. As I\nsuspected, this place does have some\nconnection to Miyazawa...
It comes from "one" plus -ly. And of course\nit means "one of a kind."
It comes from the Latin for "thing spoken by\nthe gods." It's used to mean an inescapable\nresult\u2014much like death.
It could also use a bath, massage chairs,\nmaybe a manga-reading corner...
It could be a demonic dessert made to lure in\nunsuspecting youths. A new threat!
It could be interesting to think about what\ndesires caused these divergences.
It could be pretty much anything! Hmm. Give\nme a hint at least! Is it sweet?
It could be that certain other individuals\nhave come to this world as well.
It could be the key to unlocking that door\nin Katayama's Palace.
It could be worth hearing\nher play...
It couldn't be more peaceful... But\nsomething's missing.
It definitely wasn't my intention to come off\nlike I wasn't takin' this thing seriously.
It depends, but high-end tools come in\nthe six-figure range.
It devours itself and is reborn in an\neternal loop. It symbolizes the cyclical\nnature of the universe.
It did seem that way. Almost as if it\nabsorbed the energy of the Palace through\nthat cable.
It did. And it was so far removed from my\nimage of Ms. Katayama, it was almost like...
It didn't sound like your first.|You've never performed live?
It didn't sound rough to me.|What are you planning to add?
It does look like rain...\nDo you have an umbrella?
It does sound strange to say that places as\nclose as Yokohama and Tokyo speak different\nlanguages.
It doesn't feel right to beg my fans for\nsympathy.
It doesn't have to be just me and my books\nand urban legends against the universe\nanymore.
It doesn't look like we can sneak in here.\nLet's try elsewhere.
It doesn't really matter who wins as long as the show is fun, right?
It doesn't seem like I've done anything to\nwarrant apologizing.
It doesn't seem like he's caught a new\npower source yet.
It doesn't seem like the residents have any complaints, though.
It doesn't seem to be locked... Shall we\ngo inside?
It doesn't seem to open from\nthis side...
It doesn't seem to open\nfrom this side.
It doesn't seem we can use this elevator.
It even has classical texts! Hey, can I look\nat this one too?
It feels a bit metaphorical for all of\nits truths to not all be true.
It feels cooler already.
It feels like Chiyome was always watching\nover me, even in the Metaverse...
It feels like a Palace, yet the atmosphere is\nslightly different...
It feels like only yesterday that we began\nour special contract.
It feels like we're all\nto blame...
It feels like you're really listening to me,\nlike you're ready to back up anything I play.
It feels pretty nice to receive a written\nmessage like this.
It fosters student autonomy and frees up\ninstructors to focus on teaching.
It gets busy when the high schoolers come to\ndo the occasional cleaning for community\nservice, though.
It gets really annoying. I end up expecting\nthe same reaction from everyone.
It gives the dashi a lighter taste that won't\noverpower any later add-ins like sauce or\nseaweed flakes.
It goes "all roads lead to Rome." It refers\nto the road network in and around the area.
It goes down easy even if you're not hungry\nor feelin' sick. Always good to have some\non hand.
It goes to show that not everybody is\ncut out to be a Phantom Thief...
It goes well with both the noodles and\ncorn. Versatile... A vague but accurate\ndescription.
It goes without saying that I won't be\nmaking actual cocktails, of course.
It got that name because it was located\nbetween the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
It had a huge impact on Western culture. Much\nof it still remains relevant to this day.
It has a real je ne sais quoi.
It has a slight warmth to it.
It has this soft, inviting atmosphere that\nmakes you want to visit again and again.
It healed all of the damage we've dealt\nso far!
It helps me come up with a good solution.
It hit me again that the cognitive world\nreally is something else.
It indeed does look familiar.
It is a bit dry. I will recommend you a\nskincare routine.
It is a clear reflection of your desires.\nI am much intrigued.
It is a dark world. Bleak, and malignant.\nA place that light itself cannot reach.
It is a symbol of warped desire, and constitutes the very core of what gives the Palace its form.
It is certainly quite different from the bath\nat home, hoom?
It is fascinating how idols and fans share\nsuch a special connection.
It is my duty to understand you. I shall ask\nas many times as necessary.
It is only by pursuing our genuine beliefs\nthat the path ahead of us will become clear.
It is quite embarrassing to tell the truth...\nSo, would you mind putting me down?
It is reasonably busy today.
It is that knowledge by which you have become a guest in this realm.
It is the name your power has given itself.
It is time I free the pristine power hidden\nwithin your mortal flesh...
It is time to recover what's been lost. Take back what's been stolen.
It is time to release the rage buried within\nthis desecrated soul...!
It is time you teach people which is which!
It is true that I take my family's company\ninto account when making decisions, but...
It is unlikely that we'll be able to break\nthrough from the front.
It is vital that one make an effort to avoid\nneedlessly burdening their idol.
It is what you just witnessed. That power.
It is worth coming back, hoom? Well, shall we\nhead home?
It is!
It is! Very much so! Would you like to try,\nRusset?
It is, huh!?
It is... special to meet someone who feels\nmoved by such things, is it not?
It isn't impossible that only Closer was\nseparated from the group and ended up in\na different part of the Metaverse.
It isn't the name that's important, but the essence.
It isn't your fault.|Don't worry about it.
It isn't, but it is what people perceived back then.
It just appeared on my phone one day and\nkept coming back every time I deleted it.
It just kind of seems like the flavor is a lot weaker than it was before.
It just looked like a cute pose to me.
It just needs energy.|With the transmission device.
It just started. Shun... He knows he can't\nwin, but he's going through with it anyway.
It kind of reminds me of Buchimaru-kun\nin a way!
It kinda looks like a face...
It left a huge impression on me.
It locked itself. The door's\nnot opening...
It looked like he was talking to that guy over...
It looked much bigger on the television. No wonder I had such trouble finding it.
It looks amazing! She's beautiful!\n"Anyone could pull it off." What are you even saying?
It looks as if you've conquered a fear.\nWell, shall we call it a day?
It looks dangerous ahead...
It looks divine! And there's so much of it...
It looks heavenly! Time to dig in.
It looks like I can climb up\nfrom here...
It looks like I have some waste to\ndispose of!
It looks like Minami and her\ndad get along pretty well...
It looks like Minami has to\ntake care of those kids.
It looks like Minami's\nhelping at the shop...
It looks like Mr. Higashino's confined\nhimself to the prep room and\nstarted composing.
It looks like Panther left behind a clue for us!
It looks like Victory Kitchen\nis holding an event...
It looks like Yui hasn't\nvisited our field since the\nlast time I saw her.
It looks like a hint appeared over there.\nWe should check it out.
It looks like a person...|Is it really a Shadow?
It looks like he's heading for the shoe\nlockers.
It looks like it'll be a great song.
It looks like it's broken...
It looks like moving this box also moves that\npitching machine.
It looks like some of the sensors are\ndeactivated. We may be able to proceed.
It looks like the announcement for\nMiyazawa's live broadcast is coming soon...\nAre you ready for it?
It looks like the crowd's\nindifference really\ndemoralized her...
It looks like the energy's been sent out.
It looks like the fortune\nteller isn't here...
It looks like the gate came down!
It looks like the red one is a trap.
It looks like the same thing Madarame is using!
It looks like there's some kind of large\nstructure in the distance.
It looks like they're closed for the day.
It looks like they're packing a powerful\nwallop next! <color=#FF423F>Defend</color> yourself!
It looks like those three are the\nmasterminds! This... This is...!
It looks like we can <color=#FF423F>adjust the numerical\nvalue</color> by attacking the shadows around Thoth.
It looks like we're short-staffed in the\nkitchen today. Would you mind helping out?
It looks pretty complicated...
It looks pretty difficult.\nSolving this won't be\nthat simple...!
It looks too heavy for us to move...\nOh! Unless...
It made me realize I need to be more flexible\nin my thinking and careful with my words.
It made me sick reading the things they said.\nThe kind of abuses they slung at her...
It made me wish I could've become one. Even\nthough I was the one who gave up on dancing.
It makes me so happy that you two would be so\nconsiderate of me this way. Truly.
It makes me think that I'm too constrained\nby insisting on formal correctness.
It makes me want seconds.|I could eat it every day.
It makes me wonder what\nkind of person lives there...
It matches your Persona too!
It may be a tad tiresome running in place\nwith unchanging scenery...
It may be holding onto the keycard.\nLet's go!
It may be obvious to me, but you should\nknow, not just anyone could manage that.\nHold your head high.
It may be presumptuous of me, but please\n accept this round of applause.
It may be small, but it packs some serious\nfirepower! Enough to blow up those barriers!
It may become the key to averting the\ncoming catastrophe.
It may even aid you in the strengthening\nof your desire.
It may even open other doors.\nIt seems well worth a try.
It may have a deeper meaning.|Did they draw it wrong?|I don't get it.
It may just be speculation on my part,\nbut I believe there's good reason to be\nsuspicious of him.
It may not be the right time for this door\nto open. Let's try another time.
It may sound ridiculous, but this kind of\nthing happens all ofthe time.
It may turn out to be nothing at all, but...\nif something were to happen, we best\nbe prepared.
It means that more people will become\nawakened to their desires now.
It means you're buying a book without caring\nwhat it's about.
It mentions some kind of competition for\nflair bartenders.
It might be a bit rough at first, but the\nbusier it is, the more money you'll make!
It might be a trap!|You just wanna try the dessert.
It might be nice to sit down and observe\ninstead of running around, for a change.
It might be nice to visit\nhere with someone...
It might be that I may have, possibly...\nlost my staff ID card...
It might be useful somehow.
It might be wise to work another shift if\nthe opportunity arises.
It might be worth\nchecking out...
It might be! It's hard to say for sure\nright now.
It might just be a scrimmage, but it's our first win with this lineup!
It might make for a romantic date spot, hm?\nOf course, a friendly outing would be fun\nas well.
It might remind one of the recent "Menacing"\nincidents. We might think of these as bad\napples who've fallen from the wagon...
It must be a marvelous sight to see all the\npaintings lined up here. I'd love to see it.
It must be something else.
It must be stress.
It must be that\nproducer's Shadow.
It must have been the form this Kamoshida\nfellow saw as his ideal version of you.
It must have had the same effect as a\ncalling card.
It must have taken real guts\nto ride into the danger zone\nlike that...
It opened!
It packs a punch,\nbut it tastes amazing...!
It probably means in front of Buchiko.
It probably went\nout of business...
It rarely makes a difference and, in fact,\nonly obfuscates the meaning!
It really does...
It really does.|It's very beautiful.|Anyone could pull off that outfit.
It really doesn't bother me.|I think it's cute.
It really is a "shack," huh?
It really is a popular shop.\nThe stream customers seems\nto have no end...
It really is a pretty color.\nI wonder what's in it...
It really is crowded.
It really is. And I'm glad that Motoha seems a lot happier recently too.
It really makes an impression, huh?\nDefinitely caught me off guard the first\ntime I saw it.
It really took a toll on morale for the ones who stuck around.
It resembled a door in that shack in the real world.
It returned to normal after we watched\nthat film.
It said to meet her in the audiovisual room\ntoday after classes.
It saw it on TV.
It says "camera" on it...\nCouldn't this be the power source\nfor the surveillance cameras?
It says it's being borrowed.
It says it's the tallest radio broadcast\ntower in Japan. The view from the top\nmust be spectacular.
It says that a cute maid will do anything for you!
It says that solo singers\nare welcome...
It says the reason was "violent behavior on\nschool property." But she would never\u2014
It says there are two liars, but if that's\ntrue, then all their stories are\ncontradictory!
It says they also\ntreat birds...
It says to make sure to sort\nyour trash...
It says we're on the mid-level. We'll need\nto go around to reach the next elevator.
It says, "Big eaters, come try\nyour luck!"
It seemed like a hassle, so I've never done\nit. Been on my mind for a while, though...
It seemed pretty intuitive to me, but I guess\nit's math jargon. 
It seems Anderson is\nlike that with everyone...
It seems I can only go in\nat certain times...
It seems I have no choice but to use\nmy full strength...
It seems I'll have no problem putting you\nto <color=#FF423F>work</color> right away.

It seems another treasure chest\nhas appeared.
It seems as though Minami\nis about to appear...
It seems as though this door won't open...
It seems as though this\ndoor won't open...
It seems conventional.|Where's the "change"?
It seems dangerous ahead.
It seems it is not that simple. I don't\nsense a single treasure in the area.
It seems just as Wind surmised, this Palace\nis a dam powered by Katayama's anger.
It seems like "service with a smile" is\nrequested in many other jobs besides\nburger establishments.
It seems like Dad and I both have an easier time being honest when you're there.
It seems like Minami\nwants to talk...
It seems like everyone's headed home. Shall\nwe retire for today as well?

It seems like it's sold out...

It seems like the Shadow's desire to join you transformed it into a Persona for you to use.
It seems like the cat has\nsomething to tell me...
It seems like there's no way to stop him from the real world.
It seems like there's something different\nabout you. No, it's probably just\nin my head...
It seems like there's\nsomething going on here...
It seems like this man can\nunderstand what the cat\nis saying...
It seems like we can't get in now.
It seems like we got the order wrong.
It seems like you could use this place\nto wash anything too big for your home\nwashing machine.
It seems like you've all come to the same\nconclusion I did. There are too many\nof these "coincidences" to overlook.
It seems many people do their studying at\nthese "<color=#FF423F>diners</color>."
It seems organization is your m\xe9tier.
It seems so. We must have taken a wrong turn.
It seems that Palace must be Katayama's after\nall.
It seems that Shadow left something\nbehind when it ran off.
It seems that commanding a wide range of\ncharacters has also increased your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
It seems that it takes some time for the\ndefeated parts to revive. If that's the\ncase...
It seems that leaving this place causes one\nto lose their memories of all that occurred.
It seems that the entrance in Mementos\nvanishes once a Palace is destroyed.
It seems that this door still won't open...
It seems that this door won't open.
It seems that we cannot use the camera...
It seems the Palace ruler is definitely Miyazawa.
It seems the Treasure is higher above us.\nLet's keep going upward.
It seems the numbers are against us... Let's\nproceed with caution.
It seems the orange tabby's trust in you was\nnot misplaced.
It seems the owner still has work to do.
It seems the shutter over there has opened.
It seems the story was based on the author's\ntrue experiences. It could almost be\nconsidered non-fiction.
It seems there are no more places to investigate around here.
It seems there's a proper order to this...
It seems there's another condition for opening this door that we've yet to meet.
It seems there's no way past... Let us search\nfor another way.
It seems they take the tea leaves, wrap them\naround the dried flowers, and tie them all by\nhand one by one... I think!
It seems they're neighborhood\nkids who know Minami and\nher family.
It seems they're sold out. We'll have to\ncome back another time.
It seems this customer is quite flummoxed by\nthe menu options. Could you offer\nany recommendations?
It seems this door\ncan't be opened.
It seems this is no time for us to\ndilly-dally.
It seems this isn't an option yet. Let's\nsearch the area.
It seems to be a popular date spot as well.\nIs there anyone you'd like to invite there?
It seems to be preparing a powerful attack.
It seems to really want this\ncat food...
It seems tough...|Why me?

It seems we can enter from here.
It seems we can even exit via this painting.

It seems we can't hurt it\nwhile its mouth is closed.\nWhat should we do...
It seems we can't keep going from here.\nIs there any way around the back?

It seems we must collect 12 trophies.
It seems we now have a course of action, but\nbefore we get going...
It seems we'll be able to execute Kiuchi's change of heart sooner than I expected.
It seems we'll need a key to open it up...\nLet's search the area, shall we?
It seems we'll need to gather more information first.
It seems we're getting close to the Treasure...
It seems we're unable to enter. Let's press\non for now.
It seems we've been sent somewhere\noutside Mementos...
It seems we've collected all the treasure here.

It seems you are truly in the zone today.
It seems you are using the power bestowed\nupon you effectively.
It seems you can play a previously completed\nstage at a higher difficulty...
It seems you gained some new understanding,\nwhilst I gained a craving for braised pork.
It seems you have devoted yourself to strengthening your desire. Excellent.
It seems you need a module to use the camera.\nLet's find one.

It seems you're out of bait.
It seems you've gained some behind-the-scenes\nknowledge of filmmaking and composition.
It seems your brutal training has honed\nboth your mind and body.

It seems your efforts paid off despite the\nhustle and bustle.
It should allow us entrance to a new area\nof Mementos.
It should be safer for us to move around now.
It should be somewhere around here. I've\nlooked everywhere, still no sign of it.
It should work out if we treat it as a\ncooling-off period... And the loan probably\nhasn't even been processed yet.
It smells both good\nand familiar...
It smells like someone's\ngrilling eel.
It smells nice...
It smells...
It sneaks into houses, steals food, and even\nattacks other cats...
It snows here all year long!
It sort of tastes like... fish broth? Maybe bonito? I can't be sure... It's pretty indistinct.
It sounded like Mr. Akashi.|It threatened to consult us to death.
It sounds beneficial.
It sounds like Mr. Akashi was purposely\ntrying to provoke Ms. Katayama.
It sounds like Tanzo's busy\nwith the shop... I should call\nthe customer myself.
It sounds like a job is just what you need to whip your attitude into shape.
It sounds like she can talk about things with you she can't say to me.
It sounds like the <color=#FF423F>senpai</color> mentioned in the\ndiary is a reserve first baseman.
It sounds like you were able to meet up with\nthe orange tabby. That's good to hear.

It sounds ridiculous, I agree. But at the\nsame time... I kinda get it.
It sprays water quite well, although it is a\nlittle difficult to control.
It stinks of festering demons here... Always\ngives me the creeps.
It sure is! As they say, the bigger, the\nbetter!
It sure is! I'm on cloud nine!
It sure was.|Plus other footage too.
It takes a lot of <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to never give up, no\nmatter how hopeless the situation. What do\nyou think?

It takes heaps of trial and error till you\nend up with somethin' you approve of.

It took a lot of effort by your teacher,\nMs. Katayama, to keep me from gettin' into\nworse trouble.
It took a while to clear up\nShiina's misunderstanding...
It took me awhile, but I think I finally see\nthe point of me studying here...
It took some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\nto sing so boldly...
It turned back into a chain... With this we\nhave all three.
It turns to ice.|It begins to boil.|It turns to simply syrup.
It varies based on the going rate for metals,\nbut making a one-yen coin costs roughly\nthree yen.
It was Joker and the rest of my friends\nin the Phantom Thieves who opened my eyes.
It was Ms. Chouno, wasn't it?
It was a bit much for me personally, but it\nreally took some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to get through that.
It was a breeze.|That was close.
It was a busy day, but I'd say it was\na fulfilling one.
It was a good song.|You really did!
It was a lovely sound. I'd love to hear\nagain. After all, music is what puts the\nrhythm in rhythmic gymnastics!

It was a nice tune.|I'd like to hear the rest.
It was a sequel to a popular series, but it\nsounds like there was a lot of difficulty on\nthe production side...
It was actually written by a male author.
It was always my dream to run a cr\xeaperie when\nI was a little girl.
It was beyond our control. He chose that\npath by his own will.

It was busy, but you made it through without\nissue. You've become quite adept here, too.
It was cool.|It was like you were dancing.|I was on the edge of my seat.

It was even able to recall\nits name that it had\nforgotten...
It was fascinating to read the tactical\nexchanges as the protagonist anticipated his\nopponent's moves and outwitted them.
It was fascinating to watch you fearlessly\ntake on endless ramen.
It was finally solved in 1965.
It was given to me by my late wife... I kept\nit to remember her by. I planned to give it\nto Shun once he completed his training.
It was good.|It was pretty tough.|I nailed it.
It was great working with you! Thanks for\ntoday.
It was hard to turn him down, haha.
It was interesting, but then the story got\nso heavy it was hard to watch...
It was just as I foresaw... Oh, I forgot to\nintroduce myself. My name is <color=#FF423F>Chihaya Mifune</color>.
It was just so sudden... Someone who seemed so happy around me jumping like that...
It was kinda tough this time.|They're in some weird places.
It was like a text message, but for sending\nphotographs you took on your phone.
It was much more intense than I expected...\nBoth physically and psychologically. Hoo.
It was my fault for not listening to her.
It was no trouble at all.
It was no trouble at all.|I'm glad he's happy.
It was not just I who learned from engaging\nin idol culture.
It was nothing, really. But...
It was on {NAME1}-kun's phone too. This weird app that keeps reappearing no matter how many times I delete it...
It was only once the townspeople recognized\nthe pain in their hearts that they could\nfinally begin to rebuild from the war...
It was quite the endeavor, but we've made it\nhere at last.
It was really... out of nowhere.
It was right around here, wasn't it?
It was something that happened in the heat\nof the moment. I couldn't pull it off again\neven if I wanted.
It was that, what was he called, Subway\nSlammer? One of those "Menaces," right?
It was the Subway Slammer!
It was the only thing that mattered.\nEverything else was just noise.
It was the same for me.
It was the same for the explorers in the Age of Discovery.
It was the same with Kiuchi and Miyazawa...\nHasn't it always been that way?
It was when I was a first-year student.
It was worth a try, and I was right.\nOf course, I had several other guesses\nin mind.
It was... After we beat Kiuchi, the Palace\ndisappears. Cattle said it, right?
It was? I don't really get how, but I'm happy\nI could help you at least.
It wasn't always about the competition.\nI wanted to be on the same pro team with her\nsome day.
It wasn't me either.|Then who was it?
It wasn't on purpose. That's not my fault.
It went according to plan is all.
It will be difficult to search as long as\nthe power plant is on lockdown.
It will be no easy task since the doors are\nlocked and he's hypervigilant of intruders.
It will leave no trace of our intrusion, in addition to being quite stylish.
It will only make a brief appearance\non the evening news.
It will take a bit of <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to try it out.
It won't be anything that difficult. I'd just\nlike someone to bounce ideas off of.
It won't be perfect...
It won't be so easy. These days you need to\ngo viral to get anywhere.
It won't work. If his Shadow is running loose, then...
It won't.|It'll be okay.|Take your time.
It worked!
It would also appear that the number of\npeople relying on your decisions...
It would be great to have your help on this\nmission to save this lady's muscles!
It would be inappropriate for you to go there.
It would be my pleasure.
It would be ruder to turn them away, right?
It would be unwise to challenge him now.
It would behoove us to try and avoid the\nShadows on guard here.
It would have taken great courage to confront\ntheir boss... and even more to break into\nsong in the middle of the street!
It would have taken true\nskill to master billiards\non a galactic scale.
It would seem I have ordered too much. Please\nhelp me finish this food.
It would seem so. But I've never seen one\nlike it before!
It would seem that the <color=#FF423F>elevator</color> we passed\nearlier will bring us closer to the Treasure.
It would seem that was the wrong order...\nPerhaps you could use your skills of\nperception to uncover a hint.
It would seem unnatural if I suddenly started\nfussing over him, wouldn't it?
It would seem you've gathered your thoughts.
It would seem you've had an epiphany.
It would seem you've recalled something.
It would've been sixty years ago when I was\naround your age...
It wouldn't have come to that...!
It'd be a shame to waste the chance,\nafter all!
It'd be best if we could get it to him\ndirectly, but obviously we don't know where\nhe lives, so...
It'd be easy to use somewhere this open.\nAim, strike... and yell out your catchphrase!
It'd be good to check if you all understand\nthat before we're too deep in the lesson.
It'd be great if I could ask you for advice\nagain. Oh, but don't tell Kayo-san, okay?
It'd be great if we could grow food here...
It'd be kinda awkward then... The movie's got\nsome horror-y bits, after all.
It'd be mean to reject them, so I\naccepted it.
It'd be my pleasure.|Thanks, but no thanks.|If you'd like.
It'd be nice to work together again sometime.\nAh, I mean, if you want to, {NAME1}-kun.
It'd be one thing if the shops Miyazawa blasted were actually bad, but...
It'd be so sad if I tried to help him, only\nfor it to have the opposite effect.
It'd be weird!
It'd be, uh... more fun if we had more time\nto talk, y'know?
It'd probably be quicker to learn by doing.\nWonder, do you happen to know of any\nservers we can destroy?
It'd really be no thanks to me anyway.
It'd sound like I wanted something more...\nOr give you the wrong idea...
It'll be a nighttime shoot, of course, but I\nwon't make you stay out that late.
It'll be a pain if they find us here...
It'll be a problem for us if this new guy's just pretending to be some expert.
It'll be fine. There's still a few days until the scrimmage.
It'll be my fault, won't it? All because I\ndecided to go to college...
It'll be up to you to convince the chief.
It'll leave your tastebuds begging for more with every sip!
It'll make things easier for my mom... It's\nalso a way to give myself more credibility as\na chef.
It'll probably get hectic, but try to\nkeep it cool.
It'll spit out a ton of drinks for the price\nof one! If it doesn't work, just give it\na whack!
It'll start when I press the button.\nYou ready?
It's <color=#FF423F>Haruna Nishimori</color>! You write "Haruna"\nwith the characters for sun and flower!
It's Divine Justice... Whoa, apparently there's another Menace.
It's Japan's oldest example of diary\nliterature, and it shows respect to the\nopposite sex.
It's Kiuchi... he's on the news!

It's OK, I'll be there too.|You could always grab my arm.

It's Shota-kun!
It's Shujin Academy.
It's a Phantom Idol.|They're on our side.
It's a Treasure Demon! Defeat it, and its\ntreasure will be ours!
It's a bit boring...|That doesn't sound like you.
It's a bit far, but I'm headin' to\nTsukishima. A place there caught my eye.\nLet's go.
It's a bit too long to explain... I'd rather\ntalk face-to-face.
It's a bit unnatural.|Don't change it too much.
It's a cool feeling when you recognize a song\nin the middle of the movie, y'know?
It's a date.|Not right now...
It's a dead end. Could there be another\npath nearby?
It's a definitive example of armchair theory... How riveting.
It's a dish with more of a history than I\nrealized... You could call it Tokyo's secret\nspecialty, huh?
It's a fire hydrant.
It's a free ticket, you know?
It's a good place to start.
It's a good story, and it probably helped\nincrease your <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> as well, hm?
It's a good thing you were here to help me\nfind the truth, {NAME1}-san.
It's a good thing you were here.
It's a great story.|Your dream came true.
It's a lair of strong folks and powerful\nbeasties! Most don't venture that way now.
It's a list of all the new releases on\nstreaming sites...
It's a little scary how you can guess what\nI like, even at my age...
It's a lot of work to take care of them, but\nI love harvesting big vegetables.
It's a move I wanted to show you the next\ntime you came by.
It's a name we use to disguise our identities in the Metaverse.
It's a new one our chief brought in recently.\nIt's about home vegetable gardens, I think.
It's a personal greeting! So, what's bonkin'?
It's a plan! Let's head outside!
It's a plan, then! I'm looking forward to it.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\nMr. Akashi.
It's a popular kind of ramen in Niigata. That\nmust be where they got the inspo for this.
It's a possibility. We have stolen twisted\ndesires from two people already.
It's a pretty fascinating example, isn't it?\nSee? Math can be cool!
It's a pretty, pink cocktail...
It's a principle the world has largely turned a blind eye to, but I am referring to survival of the fittest.
It's a puzzle challenge that's supposed to\nbe suuuper hard!
It's a ramen shop. Back in little league, I always went there to celebrate after winning a game.
It's a recent thing, I've got time to spare\nthese days. Oh, do you need a bag?
It's a row of large\nwashing machines.
It's a row of trophies and\nawards.
It's a row of trophies\nand awards.
It's a safe room.
It's a sea of Shadows down there.
It's a shop that's popular\neven with tourists.
It's a simple job, but the finished product\nis entirely dependent on the skill\nof the chef.

It's a small contest, but getting to have fun\nperforming with a nice band of friends...
It's a small-scale tournament. Or I guess\nit's more like a gathering for flair\nbartenders?
It's a solid white USB drive, about\nthis big.

It's a text from Mom.
It's a type of ramen called "mixed noodles."\nBasically, you mix the noodles yourself with\nthe sauce below them.
It's a vast world out there! It's not\nthat odd for there to be more\nPersona-users who we don't know.
It's a vibrant green drink...
It's a way to show support.|Maybe they're all good.
It's a weird world out there.|I don't see the appeal.
It's a wonderful place.|I think it's a great spot.
It's a wonderful song.|Have you picked a title?

It's about the nephew I mentioned before.\nHe started living with us recently.

It's about to close! I gotta go. Tell Ritsuka\nand the others I had an errand to run!
It's about to get quite crowded in here.\nShall we get going?
It's about to target someone!\nPrepare to cover them!
It's actually kind of fun seeing how far you\ncan stretch a little change.
It's actually pretty easy, so we can just\njump right into it. First, we circumcircle\nan arbitrary triangle...
It's after school. Let's\nhead to Shibuya Station...
It's all about how many cows you need.
It's all because of me.
It's all because of you that we're here now.
It's all coming back to me...
It's all in your head.|You're overthinking it.
It's all m-my fault...!
It's all on me for keeping quiet and not letting it heal. Sorry, guys.
It's all right.

It's all somebody else's problem until it\naffects you personally, y'know?
It's all thanks to Takanashi.|I'm glad Takanashi could remember it.

It's all thanks to you to that Musubi and I\nare where we are today, Russet.
It's all thanks to you, {NAME1}-san. I never\ncould have managed this alone.
It's all thanks to your support, {NAME2}.
It's already running...
It's also a good idea to prepare yourself before moving forward.
It's also how humanity arrives at new discoveries.
It's always awkward if it turns out our\nfavorite teams are rivals or something...
It's always busy, but today's especially\ncrazy. You'll get a pay boost, of course, so\ncan I count on you?
It's always college this, career that...\nWhatever. I'm not interested in any of it!
It's always rough with these first few classes...
It's always so beautiful here. I feel like I\ncould just watch the waves forever...
It's always so nice around here no matter\nwhen you come, huh? It's got such a relaxing\nvibe.

It's an alert for a temperature malfunction.
It's an enemy! Be on your guard!
It's an ideal moment to relax.
It's an investment! This ten thousand yen is\ngonna be the start of my new life.
It's an investment, right? You'll get more\nback if you put more money in.
It's an old Japanese\nsweets shop.
It's an older work, but the story still\nresonates today. The innocence of children\nis always touching.
It's announced the day of, and they only make\nso many bowls, so it's hard to get.
It's another change... An unwelcome one at\nthat. Everyone's completely losing it.
It's another closed door! Can we just kick\nit down this time!?
It's as crowded as the\nmanager said. Time to\nbuckle down.
It's as if everything you do is based on if\nyou think it will help your family business.
It's at times like this when I really miss\nthe <color=#FF423F>chief's</color> coffee and curry...
It's basically like juice.
It's beautiful...|It's fascinating...
It's because I'm his friend.|It's because I'm on his side.|It's because we're kindred spirits.
It's because of his Shadow.|His Shadow's gone out of control.
It's because of you that I've been able to\nkeep going.
It's been a while since I got to put my\nfielding skills to good use. It felt pretty\nnice.
It's been a while since I've done heavy\nlabor like this. Reminds me of my baseball\ntraining.
It's been a while, Skull. And you, quasi-cat...\nI see you haven't changed one bit.
It's been a while, so how about we get back\nto our usual routine? My way of saying\nthanks!
It's been botherin' me for a long time,\nwonderin' what you meant by "innovation."
It's been consistent so far, but really, how\nare we supposed to apply a camera here?
It's been forever!
It's been sealed off!
It's been years since I tried running at full\nspeed on the beach.
It's being stolen.
It's best to ease into practicing\nas a beginner.
It's best to use <color=#FF423F>multi-target</color>\nskills to attack.
It's best to use <color=#FF423F>single-target</color>\nskills to attack.
It's big and looks pretty heavy... but in the\nMetaverse, it doesn't feel that way.
It's big, so I'll have it delivered for ya. You live in the city, yeah?
It's boiling in here... That <color=#FF423F>thermal energy</color>\njust keeps coming.
It's both wonderful and important to study\nhard and help one's family, but...
It's bustling, but I have faith in you.
It's by an author I deeply respect\u2014the debut\nnovel of Toshia Soomy!

It's called <color=#FF423F>Takemi Medical Clinic</color>...
It's called the Book of Baseball... but it's\nentirely about Kiuchi's life!
It's certainly around her\u2014 Hm?
It's certainly intriguing.|If you say so...
It's certainly not what I was expecting...\nBut these weapon designs are quite inventive.
It's certainly possible, but I can't say for\nsure just yet... At any rate, we should\ninvestigate those cameras first.
It's chaotic in a good way. Sort of like a\nblend of the old and new.
It's clear we need to stop him without a moment's delay, or the number of victims will keep piling up.
It's clear you aspire to rule the valley, but I will stop you!\nNow enough of this nonsense! Let's settle this in battle!
It's closed, huh? Guess we'll have to take\ncare of these Shadows to open it up.
It's closed... It appears our path\nis blocked.
It's completely rusted, so I doubt it's\nusable. But if you wanted to try... now that'd\nmake for some pretty good footage.
It's completely, totally empty!
It's cool. I've got nothing going on, so I don't mind tagging along.
It's cramped behind the counter, but good\nfootwork opens up so many possibilities.
It's crazy busy, but the extra pay will be\nworth it.
It's dangerous on the other side of that door now!
It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.

It's delicious, and I'd definitely say that\nit gets an A+ for originality.
It's delicious, but there's a\nbig eggshell in it...
It's delicious, but...|Nice eat-and-walk-ability, but...
It's delicious, so it's fine.|You'll eat it like candy.
It's difficult, isn't it? I'd want to get\nback to my sport as soon as possible, if only\nI could.
It's easy to forget that "desire" can mean more\nthan greed or lust; it also fuels the will to live.
It's easy to get confused since the lower\npart is at the top, but just think of it from\nthe perspective of someone living there.
It's easy... You've just got to let go.\nThink you can handle it?
It's even more amazing than I'd imagined on\nthe inside.
It's exactly like Lufel said. This is the change of heart.
It's famous in the neighborhood.
It's fascinating to know our friendship\nhas changed me.
It's fertilizer made specifically for cyber\npotatoes, so that can't be the case.

It's fine. Don't worry about it. Let's get back to practice.
It's fine. His face isn't in the shot.\nIn fact, he's facing the complete\nopposite direction.

It's fine.|Keep it quick.
It's finished.
It's for the treasure.|It's for the orange tabby.

It's for... the kitties.... Um...
It's free?|Are you sure?
It's freshly made. I prepared it at home and\njust finished it in the home ec room.
It's from Tomoko!
It's from Yui.
It's fun talking face-to-face... but right\nnow, I want you by my side.
It's fun.|I feel motivated.|I like getting to see you.
It's funny though. Sad songs are more\ncomforting to sing than cheerful ones.
It's going to be quite tough, so make sure to rest well today.
It's going to take real <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\nto conquer such a gargantuan\nbowl of ramen...

It's got her train pass\ninside, and a baseball and\ncatcher's mitt keychain on it...
It's got more subscribers than a B-list\ncelebrity's channels. Here, let me pull\nit up...
It's gotta be about money. The guy's name means "money castle."
It's great to hear feedback on my dancing\ntoo. It's been a while since I've even shown\nthis to anyone.
It's great to hear they arrested that Subway\nSlammer. He had the girls really scared.
It's guarding the deepest part of the vault.\nWe ought to assume that it's quite powerful.
It's happening again.|It's like that weird castle...
It's hard not to feel out of place eating\nhere as a little old lady all by myself.
It's hard to describe how\nI feel right now...

It's him!
It's his debut work and magnum opus...
It's huge.|Is this really for beginners?
It's important to fit in with your peers, but\nI think the pursuit of truth is way cooler!
It's important to prevent lactic acid from\nbuilding up in your muscles and\ncausing soreness.
It's important to treat yourself now and then!\nYou gotta stay fresh.

It's irresistably thrilling! Heh heh...
It's just a hunch, but I think this room...
It's just a small local competition, but it's\ngoing to be our first one ever.
It's just as I calculated.
It's just as I thought... Let's make quick\nwork of them, Wonder!
It's just as Wind suspected. Katayama's power\nis weakening. But...
It's just as enormous\nas ever...!
It's just for research!
It's just like before. It looks like they\nturned up the steam.
It's just like the calling card said...
It's just my intuition, but I sensed a\nstrange aura from Take-kun.
It's just something I want to do. I'm not lying when I say that.
It's just speculation, but... when I touched\nMiyazawa's Treasure I...
It's just that the other bartenders were even\nbetter. So sure, I might've lost...
It's just you.|How could you tell?|It was all right.
It's just, I think you're the nicest person\nin the whole wide world, Yukimi-san...
It's just, um...
It's just...
It's kind of a relief for my first audience\nto be just you. It's... nice?
It's kind of beautiful...
It's kind of embarrassing, but it's also fun!\nI could get used to it...
It's kind of funny when you think about it.\nI'm the one who chose this.

It's kind of sad, but it's the truth.
It's kind of sad.|I don't think you need to fight.|Maybe he's holding back.
It's kind of touching when you think about\nit. We all see the same sky, wherever we are.

It's kinda freaky that even Cattle doesn't\nunderstand it.
It's kinda lame, but I was honestly really\nrattled by what Serizawa-san said earlier.

It's like a film studio.|Maybe someone's filming something?
It's like a mountain\nof noodles and toppings...
It's like a party in my mouth!

It's like the dam holding back my thoughts\nopens and the words come flooding out.

It's like... We're talking, and along the way I forget what I actually wanted to say.
It's locked?
It's made with grenadine, or pomegranate\nsyrup for the base, and then you pour ginger\nale on top.
It's more like I just want people to see\nwhat I can do. Just like back when I danced,\nI guess...
It's more than a big deal!
It's much harder to work at a flower shop\nthan one might think.
It's much like a desire in that sense.
It's my fault...
It's my first video, so I don't expect it\nto get many views right away...
It's my grandma's birthday soon. I thought\nI'd put together a bouquet for her.
It's my seat.
It's my secret talent, I guess. The sixth\nsick sheik's sick's sheep's sixth...
It's nasty at first, but once you get a taste\nfor it, the flavor's addictive!
It's nice and quiet here again today. What do\nyou wanna do?
It's nice how you can see famous spots of\nTokyo you'd usually only see on maps, and\nunravel their history.
It's nice to meet you, {NAME1}-kun.\nMy name is Riko Tanemura.
It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to see he's passionate about drawing, but\nI worry about him sometimes...\nShould I bring him something, too?
It's nice you're willing to use that name in\nreal life as well. I'm glad you took to it.
It's no different than an investment.
It's no fun playing by myself all the time...\nIf I give you one, will you play with me?\nC'mon, please?
It's no trouble. Hiroto was a good boy. It sounds like work was rough today.
It's no use playing dumb now! My ears\ndon't lie.
It's no use! Get out now.\nIt's too... dangerous.
It's noisy and customers are constantly\nentering and leaving. This may not be the\nbest place to focus.

It's not a burden at all. It's my job to\nmake school life better for all of\nthe students.
It's not a place we can bring someone lacking in resolve.
It's not a question of who is the cognition\nof who...
It's not always that simple, of course.
It's not as busy as usual, perhaps due to\nthe rain.
It's not as though her works completely\neliminated discrimination of course, but they\nmay have given courage to many women.
It's not budging...
It's not clear what he means by Eyes of Truth,\nbut we can go ahead and test some theories.
It's not easy to see the real stars in\na city such as this. I can see the appeal\nin this venue.
It's not exactly a volume you can sip by\naccident, but still. Something to keep\nin the back of your mind.
It's not good to push yourself too hard,\nthough. Why don't we call it a day here?
It's not here.
It's not just about the technique, though.\nAren't the ingredients just as important?
It's not left up to the leader, or the majority. If just one person opposes, a unanimous decision cannot be made.
It's not like I could have you try these out.\nThey've got alcohol in them!
It's not like I hate my job or anything,\nit's just that...
It's not like I wanna go to the best\nuniversity or anything.
It's not like a cognitive Metaverse, but it\ndoes feel like a collection of minds...
It's not like anything will really\nchange, but...
It's not like that. Promise.
It's not like the owner was telling me to\nenter this or anything...
It's not like the police will help if all\nhe's done is enter the store.
It's not like this will come up on your\nexams, but it could help you win your next\ngame of karuta!
It's not like we're a karaoke club. It's hard\nto recruit members for a band.
It's not like we're competing directly. What\nwe do is very different.
It's not opening... It seems we'll need some\nsort of key.
It's not over yet... Next! Haaah!
It's not quite a change of heart, but Akashi\ncan no longer steal her desire.
It's not ready yet...
It's not really for me to decide what those\nkids will or won't eat.
It's not something I'm proud of. At least\nthey left it out of the TV broadcast.
It's not that I feel like I need to be here to support Dad.
It's not that I like him necessarily, I'm just interested in him as a person, kinda...
It's not that I'm helping around the shop because I saw my dad crying or anything...
It's not that bad! I have time to study while\nyou guys are at cram school anyway!
It's not that no one has ever seen this\njuice.
It's not that simple, I'm afraid. This map\nshows only one section of the Palace.
It's not that there isn't a problem, but...\nI just don't wanna get you involved...
It's not that. It just hasn't\n<color=#FF423F>materialized</color> yet.
It's not that. Something with a powerful\naura is coming this way!
It's not the most ideal environment for us\nchosen ones, who battle the forces of\ndarkness from the shadows...
It's not time yet.|What?
It's not too busy today, so I'd like it if\nyou could help make some curry.
It's not too late.|You can still make things right.
It's not what it looks like!
It's nothin'. You should eat your lunch.\nBreak's almost over.
It's nothing life-threatening, but the\ndoctor said it could get worse if it's\nleft unchecked.
It's nothing like the broth you worked so hard to perfect.
It's nothing, really.
It's nothing. I'm\u2014
It's nuts over there. There's even a little\ngirl that asks you to donate to cats...
It's often quoted alone like that, but there's more to it.
It's ok if you have no experience playing\ninstruments. If you're interested, we'd love\nto have you.
It's okay! You don't need to explain a thing!
It's okay, Kano-kun.
It's okay, we can put that all behind us now.
It's okay. And seeing as we're all only\na year apart, please feel free to speak to me\nmore casually.
It's okay. Thanks for letting me borrow\nyour kitchen, Masa-san.
It's one of my jobs as chair of the\ndisciplinary committee.
It's one of the school's\nrest areas...
It's one of those things that'll make more\nsense if you try it out for yourself!
It's only a matter of time till he's declared a Menace.
It's only a vague recollection, but...\nyou're also a Persona-user, correct?
It's only been one day, but you seem to have\ngained a wealth of knowledge on croquettes.
It's only fair to warn you.\nYou're up against two beings who've lost everything.
It's only natural for the security to grow\nheavier the further we go. But we must\npush on.
It's only natural that we lend a hand!
It's our restaurant's best and tastiest bowl.\nPlease enjoy!
It's our shop's latest idea. The first stage\nis the Large-sized Challenge.
It's ours!
It's over. We have no intention of killing you.
It's packed today. This certainly isn't the\nideal environment for studying.
It's particularly quiet today.
It's perfect for our band... Let's finally\nplay it together.
It's perfect to fill up after training! An\nathlete once recommended it in a magazine.
It's possible everyone has been locked up\ndown there...
It's possible her heart is starting to\nabandon it.
It's possible that Kumi Katayama's mind\nconstructed him as well. Like a sort of\n"cognitive being."
It's possible that person could be watching\nus this very minute.
It's possible that the visual impact could\novershadow the actual taste...
It's possible to convince them to surrender or negotiate a trade depending on the Shadow's own desires.
It's pouring out there. You'd better get\nhome quick.
It's pretty easy to see why, but, well...
It's pretty funny watching Shun turn\non a dime like that.
It's pretty much all like that. That employee\ntook all the attention.
It's pretty nice. The plots aren't overly\ncomplicated, and the classics have great\nmusic too.
It's pretty small, but it has everything\nyou need.
It's pretty tough when I need to study for\ntests and practice skating at the same time.
It's pretty unique, being so... safari-esque?\nThat collar and all the pockets give\nit away.
It's probably because of how close we are\nto the core.
It's probably because you turned around suddenly. Take a rest, I'll go get the drinks.
It's proof that our actions in the Palace had an effect.
It's quick to mix and quick to eat. The\ningredients are small on purpose.
It's quiet and\npeaceful here...
It's quite amusing to watch you play them. Show me again when you have time.
It's ready! Our very first delivery.
It's readying a powerful strike. Brace yourself!
It's really coming together.|Can't wait to hear it live.
It's really good to see you happy,\nKotone-san.
It's really hard work for those of us who have to master a new language.
It's really not! Maybe you could play it off\nif it was raining, but...
It's really precious to me...
It's really steamy down there...
It's really the middle of nowhere, so in\nterms of finding a job, it was either move\nto the city or become a farmer.
It's really... I dunno, romantic?
It's reassuring hearing it from you, too.\nWell then, I'm gonna get this started\nright away.
It's remarkably quiet...
It's risky activating the Metaverse\nNavigator somewhere other than the\nstation entrance.
It's robust, yet evokes that mainstream shoyu\nramen flavor.
It's said they shortened the war by\nthree years and saved countless lives\nwith their work.
It's scary difficult. This is\nhard enough for a college\nentrance exam.
It's settled then. Thank you.
It's settled then. We'll each hit three balls\nfrom that machine. Whoever gets more\nhomers wins.
It's settled! {NAME1} wins!
It's settled, then.
It's settled, then. We'll turn this land into\nour farm!
It's slightly bitter yet\nsubtly sweet. The taste really\ngrows on me.
It's smart to start thinking about fitness at\nyour age! And your body's got a lot to gain!
It's so annoying when the train's late...\nHaving to get the late train slip and\neverything is such a hassle.
It's so cool! It's got that "residential"\nvibe if you know what I mean.
It's so neat that you can use origami to\nsolve three-dimensional geometry problems!
It's so quiet, and you can feel the natural\nenergy and stuff... It's, like... majestic,\nI guess? Yeah, that's the word!
It's so stuffy in here! Feels as though I'll\nrun into a spider web at any moment...
It's so tasty you'll be clucking for more!\nThere's a sayin' about yakitori, y'know...
It's some kind of\nofficial document...
It's somehow exciting and relaxing at\nthe same time...
It's starting to get packed\nin here...
It's still a pretty good shot without him in\nit, so I'd hate to let it go to waste.
It's still not enough. We can't let this\ndrag on too long.
It's still too early to say.
It's still way better than the first time we\ncame here. She's only getting better.
It's strange, isn't it? Now it feels like\ncoffee pairs with curry, and curry with coffee.
It's such a shame. I really trusted you, Erika...
It's surprisingly good!
It's sweet! I like this!|It's like soda, but not quite.|It's a little bitter.
It's sweet, sour, and...\ncomplex, but each note works\ntogether in perfect harmony.
It's sweet... Well, to me at least!
It's tasty.|The flavor's unique.
It's technically redundant and incorrect.\nI just can't get over that.
It's tempting, but I have dinner waiting at\nhome. I'll drop by again soon!
It's thanks to your input. I really\nappreciate it.
It's that light again!
It's that those who've tasted it have\nvanished from this world.
It's the Zoshigaya\nStation platform.
It's the best flair bartending show I\ncould do.
It's the blackboard.
It's the bulletin board.\nInfo about school events\nis posted here...
It's the epitome of elegance. Can you imagine\nanything else with such voguish charm?
It's the gymnasium.
It's the heart of this place, so...|It's something important, so...
It's the kids I met at the\npuzzle challenge event...
It's the least I could do when I'm not much\nof a fighter.
It's the main entrance to\nthe school.
It's the memories from that band that have\nkept me going this whole time.
It's the name of a website that compiles\nvideos of people who've been seen causing\ntrouble throughout town.
It's the pair that's usually here...
It's the perfect menu item to grab people's\nattention and get them interested.
It's the presence of a Palace ruler. It's\ndifferent from before, but there's no doubt.
It's the same with Lord Aquamarine. I get new\nmessages from him every day!
It's the same.
It's the tabby's treasure...
It's the website for\nDivine Justice...
It's the western-style\nrestaurant that opened nearby.

It's true that I've never altered my actions\nout of concern for someone else.
It's true that a student's duty is to study.
It's true, I know. Go on, now. Keep the\npraise coming!

It's true. It's only a slight difference,\nbut it seems a bit fluffier than usual...
It's true... All the people who saw Miyazawa's show are leaving horrible reviews about Heritage Kitchen.
It's true.|Aren't you eating too much?|Let's work hard together.
It's truly splendid, {NAME1}-san. As a\nkindred spirit, I am truly proud of you!
It's trying to say that imagining success\nleads to real results... I think.
It's unlocked?|What a careless castle.
It's unusual to find a book that's only\nabout ingredients. There don't seem to\nbe any recipes.
It's up in the air if she really existed or\nnot, but I love that her story of choosing\nher own path is still being told.
It's up in the mountains, so it takes over an\nhour by bus to get there.
It's up to your judgement, Leader.
It's used because we were the first to\nsuccessfully farm pearls.
It's very delicious. However, this alone is\u2014
It's very up-tempo. She said the music video\nfeatures a "totally lit dance challenge,"\nwhatever that means...
It's way gloomier in here than it was in\nKiuchi's palace. It's like Shadows could\nleap out from anywhere...
It's weight. 1 carat is 0.2 grams.
It's what your mom and I dreamed for you too, so you'd better go and do it, okay?
It's where people can share any information\nthey have about Menaces who are\ncausing trouble.
It's worth a shot.|Let's do that.
It's worth a try.|Food is art!
It's your call, Wonder!
It's your choice. In that case, let's quietly\nenjoy ourselves until we arrive.
It's your classic Chinese-style ramen.
It's your first order.|Your very first customer.
It's your responsibility to take care of\nyourself. So if that's okay with you,\nstop by anytime.
It's, um, how should I put this...
It's...
It's... They're messages from that man...\nA-Anderson-san...
It's... a bit embarassing hearing that from\na kid your age...
It's... a bit of a relief actually.
It's... difficult to describe in words.\nI'd prefer to let it speak for itself.
It's... not great, but we shouldn't leave\nthe customer waiting. Let's just\nhand it over.
It's\u2014 Well, it means, um... "spiffy and happening"!
Its authentic flavor can now be shared with\nmillions across the country!
Its established form and etiquette are all\nfor the sake of that purpose.
J-Just a moment, Arai-san. It seems this may\nbecome a lengthy discussion, so I'll need to\nset aside time to talk another day.
J-just what kind of image do you have of\nme!? The correct answer is "gentleman."\nSee, just like me!
JK, like that's possible!
Jackpot! There's a ton of stuff here!
Japan's still such a mystery to me. This sort\nof thing happens pretty much on the daily.
Jazz is like a true hobby to me. It's never\nbeen about what's in fashion.
Jeez, does it really need all these\npassageways!? And it looks like there's\nobstacles round every corner...!
Jinbocho and Harajuku were so cool, and I\nlearned a whole bunch from them.
Jinbocho is known as the world's largest\nmarketplace for secondhand books.
Jinbocho was so old-school...
Job?|The thing you mentioned yesterday?
Join in and watch|Those are some moves!
Join in|Not right now
Join my team. You'll be trained by first-rate\ncoaches.
Join our organization tomorrow
Join the game|Maybe another time

Joker is swifter and more careful than us\nall. I doubt any enemies will find him.
Joker might be this way, then! Let's keep\ngoing!
Joker's not here either, huh...
Joker-senpai!
Joker...
Joy?|Betrayal?
Judgement, Upright
Judging by her expression,\nI'm guessing she hasn't hit\nany home runs yet.
Judging by the awful stuff Kamoshida does\nin reality, I'd hate to even think what evil\ndesires inspired this...
Judging by what Closer told me, this isn't\nthe first time something like this has\nhappened.
Judging by your expression, I'd say those\nwords brought something to mind.
Judging from the map, there's a lot of\nexercise equipment in this area.
Judging from your expression, I'm guessing\nyou agree.
Jugemu Jugemu Goko-no-Surikire\nKaijarisuigyo-no...
Juggle it.|Seal it in a bag.|Pray to it.
Juggling schoolwork and phantom thievery must\nsurely be taking a toll on you.
Juice restock day is upon us once again.\nI'm ready to pursue this mystery. How\nabout you?
Jump down.
Junya Kaneshiro.
Just Cattle is fine. And yes. We were led\nhere by the collective unconscious using\nher name.
Just a few hours later, I woke up to a ton\nof notifications on my phone.
Just a joke...
Just a kick? So that's why she's Lightning\nLegs! That's so awesome!
Just a tiny little favor, but I'll make it\nworth your while. What do you think?
Just a touch of those shiny letters there\nand your favorite music will start playing.
Just act natural. Standing out too much will alert our target.
Just as I expected...
Just as I thought. Joker's heading to the\nbasement.
Just as I thought. People who have some form of connection to this shop are having their hope stolen.
Just as I thought. This place is collapsing!\nHurry, it's time to escape!
Just as I thought... It's a rather eerie\nsense of familiarity.
Just as I'd hoped. You're proving to be a real positive influence on the team.
Just as the interactions between you and\nother embracers of desire synthesize\ninto bonds...
Just as the manager predicted,\nit's packed...
Just as you never gave up on me...
Just ask your ol' senpai here if you need\nanything!
Just be careful not to finish him off, or the real Kiuchi might die.
Just because you threw away what you\ncared about...
Just because you're going away, we can't be\ntogether? Do you not trust me!?
Just bring this here voucher in, and you'll\nbe able to trade it for some reeeal\ngood stuff at my shop!
Just checking, but you don't own any\ninstruments, right?
Just come on. All you need to know right now is that I'm on your side.
Just do as you're told. THAT is the\nproper way!
Just do your best, Yaoling.|Take things at your own pace.|Gotta stop and smell the roses.
Just don't go causing a scene and make\nthings... difficult for me or my customers.
Just don't let your guard down.
Just forget about all that.

Just give it a taste. I'm confident in\nthis one.
Just goes to show how cozy this place is, right?\nDo you feel the same way, {NAME2}?
Just having a teacher come to your house is\na big deal these days.
Just help her relax.|What is she into?|Got any common interests?
Just hold on a damn minute. I have no idea what's going on anymore. First Tomoko gets hurt, now there's a talking owl and...
Just hold on, Tomoko. I promise you, I'll make him pay.
Just how long is this thing going to go\non for...?
Just how old do you think I am!?
Just keep acting natural.|As long as we're careful...
Just kidding!
Just kidding! Let's start with walking. We've\ngotta ease our bodies into exercising.
Just kidding. It'd be so embarrassing to say\nthat and then end up needing your help.
Just kidding. Japan has its own way of doing\nthings. I get that now.
Just kidding... How about a question instead\nof my bad jokes!
Just know that I only do this for familiar\nfaces, got it?
Just leave... Hurry...
Just like Mandrin, this <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> will be\nuseful for our Phantom Thief business, hm?
Just like an idol duo...|And they have code names too...
Just like here, there're tons of people\ncelebrating the stuff they're into.
Just like in your Companio, you can play\ncards to your heart's content here.

Just like we discussed, okay?
Just like with our farm, we should take both\nof our opinions into consideration.
Just like you taught me.|I was worried about you.|I wanted you to relax.
Just listening to the sound of the waves is\nso soothing...
Just little adjustments, based on\nthe weather, temperature, and humidity.
Just look at all the winding side streets\ncrammed with niche shops! The big city can\nfeel suffocating sometimes.
Just look at how high up we are...\nBetter make sure not to fall.
Just look at that thing! I bet he eats\nintruders for breakfast!
Just looking around? In that case...
Just looking at it made me break out\nin a sweat...
Just looking at the sky can be rather nice\non occasion. Perhaps we should come again.
Just looking at you makes me sick! I already\ngave up on trying to be real!
Just me in the batter's box, with the\nopposing team in front of me...
Just now, I heard the sound of a wind\ninstrument from somewhere.
Just one more thing I have to look\nforward to!
Just one more... pitch!
Just out for a walk.|Enjoying the fresh air.
Just passing Riko-senpai in the hallway makes\nme feel like my soul's been purified...
Just picturing it makes me smile.
Just reading about his fight against\ninjustice, you could probably sense a bit\nof his heroic <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>.
Just reading it might make your feet start\nmoving of their own accord. Didn't you feel\nthe same?
Just rememmber "mu, su, me, fu, sa, ho,\nand se." That's the trick!
Just run! Get out of there!
Just seeing Kaneshiro's gluttonous face\ncaused me to snap.

Just stay on the line and record this call.
Just tea?|Peach tea's a mocktail?
Just tell me the orders here, and we'll\nbe all good!
Just tell them you lost it.|Oof.
Just think about how much manpower it would\ntake to fully investigate every one of them...
Just this today.
Just to be clear, I've never had alcohol.\nNot even a sip!
Just to make sure we're on the same page, our goal here is to obtain medicine.
Just today, I mighta said somethin' I shouldn't have. Maybe I open my mouth too much.
Just use that <color=#FF423F>box</color> to clear the way, Wonder.
Just wait until my grand re-entrance...\nOops, no spoilers!
Just watching this man is an ordeal.
Just what I had in mind.
Just what I'd expect a kid these days to say.\nI really want to help him if I can!
Just when I thought nothing\ncould top her eagerness for\nlearning...
Justice, Upright
Justice...
K, U, M, I, 11 + 21 + 13 + 9... That makes\n54, but I doubt it's a two-digit passcode.
Kadota is more motivated than he was back then...
Kadota may be our guardian angel, but maybe you have a chance...
Kadota, you're on the other team, right? Go easy on us, will you?
Kadota...
Kamiyama and I reaffirmed\nour friendship...
Kamiyama and I talked about\nlive-action heroes for\na while...
Kamiyama has such a determined\nlook in his eyes. He seems set\non this decision.
Kamiyama shared his vast\nbehind-the-scenes knowledge\nof live-action hero shows...
Kamiyama told me his theories\nabout the person playing\nShichi-kun...
Kamiyama, Kurotani, and I\npledged ourselves as\nkindred spirits...

Kaneshiro!
Kaneshiro-san, that's the girl I told you about.
Kaneshiro...
Kaneshiro? Who's that?
Kano said that Miyazawa \n"threw out the soul\nof Victory Kitchen"...
Kano seems really determined.\nI can't see any way of\nconvincing him...
Kano wins!|Game, set, match!
Kano's blaming himself?|Why would he do that?
Kano's planning to fight.|We have to save Kano.
Kano-kun is kind of hard to approach,\nbut isn't he kind of hot too?
Kano-kun must already be at Victory Kitchen\ngetting ready as we speak!
Kano-kun! The ambulance is here!
Kano-kun! You were inside?
Kano-kun's a good guy. He's really nice.
Kano-kun, calm down.\nLet go of her hand.
Kano-kun, can I speak with you?\nYou two as well.

Katayama appeared on Divine Judgment and\nbecame known to the public as a Menace.
Katayama's Shadow is already at death's\ndoor. Another attack might put her life\nat risk!
Katayama's Shadow is charged with even more\npower than before! Brace\nyourselves, everyone!
Katayama's Shadow will be revived and forced\nto do battle!
Katayama's Treasure is surprisingly close.\nI sense it in that direction.
Katayama's desire... Has the power of her\nwrath subsided?
Katayama's kinda scary, huh? Maybe she's\ngot anger issues.
Katayama's wrathful desires are being\namplified... That cable is injecting some\nkind of power into her.
Katayama-sama...|You mean Ms. Katayama?
Katayama-san begged the TV station and a\nbunch of other people...
Katayama-san has a hot-headed side like me.\nShe just gets it, so I don't ever feel the\nneed to lie to her.
Katayama-san is\u2014!?
Katayama-san wouldn't hurt a fly!

Kid... When you've lived in the dark for as long as I have,\nyou can detect a person's true nature from their scent alone...
Kids aren't allowed in, so scram.
Kids aside, I'm always telling her there's no need for her to help with the shop, but...
Kill...me...
Kind of like how Rob Roy lived.
Kindness is a blessing of repose. I shall\nbecome a mask and grant tranquility to\nyour soul...

Kiuchi and Miyazawa's were in separate areas.
Kiuchi and other humans who've become Palace\nrulers, are compelled by intense desires to\nwalk the path to their own destruction.
Kiuchi did this pose a lot when he was still\nplaying, right?
Kiuchi hit that woman with\nthe baby, and she...
Kiuchi!
Kiuchi!?
Kiuchi's Palace being a baseball stadium I\nget, but... What, is Miyazawa just into\nperiod pieces or something?
Kiuchi's becoming more wary, I expect.\nIt means we're getting closer to the treasure.
Kiuchi's gaining power from those women!
Kiuchi's symbol is <color=#FF423F>frozen on screen</color>...
Kiuchi's your target?
Kiuchi's... Palace? Built from his... cognitions?
Kiuchi, huh?
Kiuchi-sama has received countless trophies.\nThe average man struggles for even one!
Kiuchi-sama was truly an exceptionally hard\nworker through all his physical training...
Kiuchi-sama! I've been waiting so long!
Kiuchi-sama's Koshien performance earned him\nentrance to the major leagues...
Kiuchi-sama's exercise regime from hell\nreally wore me out today...
Kiuchi-sama's team quickly rose through the\nranks and thoroughly crushed their rivals.
Kiuchi.
Kiuchi. An ex-pro baseball player. He's... retired now.
Kiuchi... Seeing the player I looked up to suddenly appear and...
Kiuchi... why?
Kiuchi...?
Kiuchi? Oh, there was some player with that name.
Kiyoshi Kurotani might know\nof a rare book that could be\nrelevant...
Knew it. I can always tell with stuff\nlike that.
Knew what?
Knock 'em dead, Shun!
Knowing he's not here makes me want to do it\neven more!
Knowing somebody's supporting me in the\nstands really puts me at ease. It's kind of\nchildish I guess.
Knowing that, I still train day in and day\nout. But now...!
Knowing the rules of pronunciation also\nhelps. Sometimes the sounds don't match\nthe letters.
Knowing this might come in handy whenever\nyou need to warm up your hands in winter.
Knowing what we know now, this theory must\nsound like a joke, right?
Knowledge is indeed an endless pursuit.
Kokatsu's nothing if we keep him covered!
Komatsu seems pretty\nlaid-back...
Kotone and I continued to talk\nabout what she could do with\nthe flowers she receives...

Kotone is totally absorbed\nin the song.
Kotone kept the figure skating\nfacts coming...
Kotone left.
Kotone seems to have managed\nto find the song name in\nthe end...
Kotone-san really needs them, right? And I\nreally want to help her. We have to do\nsomething...
Kotone-san!
Kotone-san!? What's wrong!?
Kumi Katayama, is it?
Kumi Katayama... My intel was right. She'll\nmake for perfect fodder.
Kumi-chan was one of 'em, and they were all\nfightin' for control over the rest.
Kumi-chan's parents didn't get along, so she\ndidn't really have a safe place to call home.
Kumi-chan? Oh, you mean Ms. Katayama! Do you\ntwo know each other?
Kumi... Katayama...

Kurotani and I toured the\nSkytree. We found no threats,\nbut my ears did pop.
Kurotani recommended a number\nof parallel world stories...
Kurotani's talking too loudly\nfor me to listen in on the\nother customers...
Kurotani-kun and... Who are you?
Kurotani-kun says he's good at card games.
Kurotani-kun!?
Kurotani-kun, do you ever think of anyone but\nyourself?
Kurotani-kun...
Kyo-kun and I joined when we started\nelementary school.
Kyo-kun, Yuna-chan, your class starts soon.\nShould we get going?
Kyushu's kuma tea, Okinawa's sanpin tea\nmade with Jasmine leaves...
L-Let me hear you squeal!
L-Look at those noodles! This is the size of a\nsmall mountain!
L-Lunch was ages ago! And we've been running around a lot.
Lab coats are so convenient. It doesn't\nmatter what you wear underneath.
Lady Ann, don't tell me you fell in love with Yusuke at first sight!?
Lament?|The truth will be revealed!
Land of idols?|Our Naruru awaits.
Landin' combos is so satisfying! Like, who's\ngot time for sleep playing that!?
Large numbers are especially confusing\nbecause they're split up differently\nin Japanese and English.
Last one! Haaah!

Lately some people even say it's good for\nyou, but apparently drinking too much can\nnegatively impact your health.

Later!
Later! Hopefully we get to work together\nagain soon.
Later.
Law can be a manifestation of desire...
Lay off! It's a secret ingredient in my\nbroth. Their stuff is super high quality.
Leader, I have a proposal to make...
Leader, it's up to you whether we continue\nexploring or return to the real world now.
Leader, it's up to you whether we head back\nor keep exploring.
Leader, may I handle this matter?
Leadership isn't easy, is it?
Leanan Sidhe!
Learn practical skills and how to make\nmoney. That's the gist of it.
Learn that, and you'll succeed in a\ncapitalist world, Fukuzawa said.
Learn? From us? You're taking this way\ntoo seriously! Oh wait...
Learning a new weapon?|You talking about working out?
Learning by doing is the best approach.\nFor now, follow my lead.
Learning how to decode those can give\nvaluable insight when you come across a new word.
Learning isn't about accepting what you're\ntold at face value.
Learning the basics of how things work\nlets you use them in new ways like this
Learning these techniques should help you\nwith your job at the convenience store.
Learning through observation alone?\nHoo, goodness. I fear for this establishment...

Let's think of it that way, {NAME1}-san.

Life has its ups and downs, as does history.
Life's better sometimes when you don't rush\ninto things.
Lightning Legs!?
Like Cattle said, let's deal with the other\nShadows first!
Like I give a shit!
Like I need you to tell me!
Like I said before, I go running all over\nthe city.
Like I said before, my parents are divorced\nand I now live with my mom.
Like I said, I only learned a little bit\nabout composing.
Like I said, first we need to impair him. Then, we'll distract him and take the Treasure!
Like I'm always telling you, my future goal is to work here!
Like Leo-chan hitting that creative wall...
Like Lufel said,\nI'm pretty exhausted...
Like Marthym, there appear to be some\nShadows that are quite fond of humans.
Like a bank...
Like a duo of idols in concert, these\ncognitive forms will act as your backup in battle.
Like a fortress from which the Shadow of an unscrupulous human can steal other's desires.
Like a ghost of my youth? A time I can never\ngo back to again.
Like a lucid dream, where you suddenly\nrealize you're in it.
Like cats and dogs...|Two peas in a pod...
Like fatty tuna, or sea urchin,\nor fatty tuna, or medium tuna,\nor kuruma shrimp, or fatty tuna!

Like the other day, the light went out in my\nroom, so I had to call the landlord, and it\nbecame this whole thing.
Like the random stranger who gave me a\nsnack a minute ago.
Like we had a choice? You can't bring an owl\ninto a restaurant. We had to book the place\nout just so you could try the food.
Like we were saying, it'd be hard to find a\nteacher more disgusting than Kamoshida.
Like we were saying, the problem is our\ncaf\xe9's producer.
Like we'd let that happen! We need to tie\nit up, guys!
Like you're always on the hunt. I bet you've got what it takes to be a striker!
Like, "Aah, this looks so good, I'll need to\nget some for myself later!" Y'know?
Like, all my problems feel so miniscule from\nup here, you know?
Like, did you know you can see the back of an\nowl's eyeball through their ear hole? Freaky!
Like, even if the potato moles come back,\nthe watermelons shouldn't be affected.
Like, in spring the ground is covered\nin cherry blossom petals and gets all\nslippery.
Like, me and my hubby are as lovey-dovey as\nit gets, but we always fight over the AC.
Like, take that bar over there, for example.
Like, why were we sent here and why some\nof us were separated.
Like, you can scan items faster if you know\nwhere the barcode is!
Like... "We've got spirit! Yes we... do..."
Like... If I lost to Kiuchi, I never could've\nfaced Tamayo.
Like... on a date?
Likely the type solved by pushing boxes\naround. The rest is up to you, Wonder.

Maybe you ought to head home and go\nto sleep tonight.
Maybe you should take a closer look next\ntime you visit the underground mall.
Maybe you should wear it.|I'd love to see you in one.
Maybe you'd be able to talk to 'em?
Maybe you'll get my order in next! Who knows!
Maybe... I could just live here instead?
Maybe... I should've gone with tonkatsu\nafter all...
Maybe... that's what Papa wanted me to learn\nall this time.

Mewhehehee!
Mewhehehee... Being a Phantom Thief is all\nabout making actual use of your wisdom,\ny'know?
Mhm!
Mhm. It doesn't seem to be the Palace we\nknow. Take these paintings... they're not\nlike before.
Mhmmm... Aha! I get it! This is a dream! Yup, for sure.
Michelangelo.|Donatello.|Gentileschi.
Might as well.|It'll be my treat.
Might have a cold... Maybe I'll stop by your\nshop for some alcohol to kill these germs\noff.
Might not be a bad idea to check the weather\nbefore heading out...

Miyazawa does seem to have a strong attachment\nto film and cameras.
Miyazawa insulted our pride as professional chefs. We should have been the ones to stand up to him.
Miyazawa losing at his own game? I don't\nknow, there's definitely something fishy\nabout that...
Miyazawa obviously didn't suggest it out of\nthe goodness of his heart.
Miyazawa took it away from him, and now he's\ntrying to tear it apart... I understand why\nhe's so angry.
Miyazawa was here!?
Miyazawa will definitely see it!
Miyazawa!

Miyazawa's retirement caused a real stir\nsince he was a fairly powerful celebrity up\ntill then.
Miyazawa-san! Does this mean all of the bad\nreviews from your internet and television\nappearances were fabricated?
Miyazawa-san! Please stop crying and answer\nthe question!
Miyazawa-san. You lost. Accept it.
Miyazawa. You already stamped the contract. Why bother challenging the kid to a Food Fight?
Miyazawa... You mean the man who came to your shop the other day? Celebrity food critic Hiromu Miyazawa?
Miyazawa...?

Mmm, pork buns and fried rice...
Mmm, so full! My tank's on F for sure!
Mmm-hmm, I see. You should make the most of\nwearing stunning outfits like that while\nyou're young.
Mmm-mmm, good. It sounds like an\nessential item on the Japanese dining table!

More importantly, I'd like an extra-large\nramen and rice... and three plates of gyoza\nwhen we get back.
More importantly, I'm swinging better than\nbefore. And my arm isn't getting sore anymore\neither.
More importantly, are you okay? It sounded\nlike your mother said some really harsh\nthings to you.
More interested in chow than charm, huh?\nWell, now you've got my tummy growling.
More like starving!|I'm not that hungry yet.|What are you up to?
More like there's been some weird things going on that I'm interested in.

More or less...|My name is Wonder.

Mrs. Curie.|Mrs. King.|Mrs. Nobel.
Ms. Disciplinary Committee was right there on\nthe scene, but didn't do anything to stop\nher?
Ms. Katayama and Masa-san were both regulars\nhere since they were students, right?
Ms. Katayama assaulted me!
Ms. Katayama attacked him, which the\nacademic coordinator and a number of other\nstudents witnessed.

Much is still unknown about Shadows.
Multiple in fact...
Multiple intruders spotted! To the security\nroom, at once!
Multiple notifications from Pops and\nKatayama-san... I made them worry about\nme again...
Muscles tell it like it is! The moment I\noffered to help, I heard them finally relax!
Muse! The subject of my painting!
Mushy school stories about passionate\nteachers get terrible ratings these days!
Musicians are so cool. I couldn't read sheet\nmusic if my life depended on it.
Must I repeat myself a second time!? Do not\nassociate me with that detestable creature!
Must be all the syrups I mixed in. They blend\ntogether well, right?
Must be pretty confident if you called me\nout here. Too bad I'm about to knock that\nconfidence right outta the park.

My app's also displaying an\nunfamiliar screen...
My appearance is just a disguise to help me blend into this world. Therefore, it has no bearing on what I'm able to eat.
My arms... feel so... heavy! You?
My assessment was accurate. Idols are indeed\nprofoundly interesting.
My bad. It was a light injury, so I didn't think I needed to bring it up.
My bad. Thanks for sharin' yours!

No kidding... Those things fire balls at a\ncrazy speed. Getting hit by one would\nseriously hurt!
No luck. We're stuck here.
No matter how hard I tried, I could never\nbecome a "real" actor, worthy of a\nstarring role...
No matter how loud the opposing team gets,\nthere's no way they can drown out those\ntunes.
No matter how many times I come here,\nthis place always feels so strange...
No matter how many times\nI read it over, it doesn't\nadd up...
No matter how much he claims to love juice.
No matter how old you get, you can always\nlearn something new.
No matter the circumstances, never abandon\nyour desires. A good lesson. We, too, should\nstrive to follow this example.
No matter the era, human desires will never\nbe satisfied... Which leads some people to\ngive up on them altogether.
No matter what I choose, it feels like I'm lying to myself.
No matter what happens to me here...
No matter what he thinks of me, I still want\nto save Take-kun.
No matter what life throws at us, let's stay\nby each other's side forever.
No matter what the task, you handle it\nwith ease.
No matter what words are thrown my way, this\nsong will reach me.
No matter what, staying true to your desires is paramount.
No matter when you go, this place is always\na breathtaking silver snowscape! Now what\nshall we do today?
No matter. If my suspicions are correct,\nwe just need to take this mechanism here...
No matter. They're all the same.\nThe <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color> shall take care of it.
No messing around at work.
No more.
No more.|I'll reclaim what's mine!
No need for combat instructions anymore, correct? Cut your way through them one by one!
No need for shyness. If I may be so bold,\nI would like to act as your personal fave.
No need for shyness. If I may be so bold,\nallow me to act as your personal employee.
No need for such ire. We could end up proving\nthat she has no Palace.
No need for that.|There's a camera here.
No need to be so cautious. I just wanna be\nfriends!
No need to be so formal.|You can drop the "-san".
No need to coordinate outfits, plenty of\npockets, and not to mention multifunctional.
No need to explain yourself. Seems like you'd\nprefer to not talk about it anyway.
No need to thank me. Just doing my part.
No need to to be shy. Music's all about\nhaving fun!
No new attractions, huh. Wouldn't be\nsurprised if we found a dangerous spirit\nlurking between its steel walls...
No no no! I'm not gonna make you sign up\nfor anythin'!
No no no, my face! You scratched my\nmagnificent face! Gagh!
No no no, nothing's gonna change my mind.\nI'm nothing like that washed up\nbaseball hack!
No no! We've never seen that thing before!
No objections here.
No obligation or anything! Just, y'know...\nIf you feel like it.
No one actually uses the audiovisual room\nnowadays.
No one bats an eye at animals lurking about\noutside Shibuya Station.
No one has free reign in my castle.
No one is born a true professional at\nanything.
No one knew the girl was trapped inside,\nand eventually she starved to death.
No one likes the grammar police, though.
No one loved baseball more than she did\nback then.
No one seems to be inside...
No one there to cheer me on...
No one uses those anymore, Pops...
No one will believe the truth unless they hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
No one would do something like that to you!
No one would want to touch it. It hurts!
No one's eager to steal a base if they think\nsomeone's watching them.
No one's going to come looking for me, which\nmeans no problems or issues.
No one's gonna stop me now!
No one's here...
No path but forward I suppose.
No point in complaining about it.\nCome on, cheer up a little!
No prob.
No problem! Thank you for the food! It was amazing!
No problem. I sense a presence nearby.
No problem. Maybe next time!
No problem.|I'll give it a shot...
No problem.|I'll take care of it.
No problem.|Now's not a great time...
No problem.|Why?
No problem.|You mean, like, right now...?
No response... Guess we'll\njust have to find another way.
No response... Nothing we can do here now.
No running in the halls.
No signs of Yui here.
No spoilers.|You'll see soon enough.
No sweat.|That was tough...
No thanks. I don't wanna distract from the\nflavor of the ramen.
No umbrella for us then.
No way in hell! That disgusting creep\ncouldn't possibly be her!
No way!
No way! "Temporarily closed"?
No way! As long as I study hard, I know I'm capable of putting out fires!\nI'll make this city a safer place!
No way! He's healed!? Is it because the\n<color=#FF423F>Core</color>'s on his head?
No way! How could you ever say anything\nremotely positive about that horrible fiend!?
No way! I really wanted this one!
No way! I wasn't even close!
No way! It's all about fish! Has this\nlemur-wannabe even tried sushi?
No way! Not in a million years!
No way! Not on my watch! Queen's OUR\nprecious ally!
No way! Not the other door too!
No way! Seriously?
No way! That was before I found out\nhow violent she is!
No way! Why the hell would Akashi's Shadow\nbe in there, then!?
No way! You caught that!
No way! You're wrong!
No way!|Don't give up!
No way, it's gigantic! How are we supposed to\nbeat something like this!?
No way, it's gigantic! How are we supposed\nto beat something like this!?
No way, my love for Kiuchi-sama can't be in vain!
No way, no way! Video footage is totally\noff-limits!
No way, that's for me? I do like this kind of\nthing, you know!
No way, you can't have ramen without rice!
No way, you're serious!? I've been wanting\none of these!
No way. I'm a striker. If I think I can score, I'll take the shot without hesitation.
No way. I've already decided. I'm doing this.
No way. THE <color=#FF423F>Hiromu Miyazawa</color> swears by\nthis place. Subtle flavor means it's refined!
No way. That'd be too dangerous.
No way...
No way... Is she gonna jump?
No way... Look at those girls! Let's go\nhelp them!
No way... This can't be real.
No wonder it's such a fashion hotspot! And\nit's not just luxury brands either.
No wonder the students love it so much. Been\nthat way for years.
No worries though! Even if you're not the\ndrinking type...
No worries! Let me know when you have time.
No worries! Maybe some other time.
No worries! Now let's get you signed up\nbefore you change your mind!
No worries! We can work out together when\nyou're free!
No worries, I can guide\nyou all.
No worries, you'll be fine!
No worries. I'll pick one out, so\nwatch closely.
No worries. Mind if we chat a bit before\nyou go?
No worries. We all start somewhere!
No worries... Well, next time then.
No!
No! He just came by a while ago. We were just chatting.
No! I can't move!
No! I'm saying, wake up!
No! I\u2014 Well\u2014 Um... I suppose you could\nsay that.
No! Is this the curse of the Evil AV Room!?
No! Motoha didn't do anythi\u2014!
No! None of this is Kano-kun's fault! This\nwas all part of your plan!
No! Not that! It's my\u2014!
No! Please... I can't...hurt my students!
No! Stop! I don't want to!
No! That was\u2014! I didn't say anything!
No! That's not gonna happen! Get your mind\nout of the gutter!
No! We can't fight him now!
No! We're not gonna take that!
No! You can't!
No, Closer was with us when we were sent\nhere. I can't imagine she's been left behind.
No, I believe it.
No, I can't let you get involved in this...
No, I don't have the leg strength for\nthat yet.
No, I don't mind.|Seems like you care about her.
No, I don't. So, you're saying...
No, I don't.|There's no time to get one.
No, I haven't seen anything...
No, I haven't uploaded it anywhere...\nI mean, that was the first time we've played\nit live, so...
No, I mean... Surely it's more reasonable to\nassume she saw wrong?
No, I only know as much as you do. It could\nbe part of the memories I lost.
No, I shouldn't be bothering you two with this stuff. Sorry, don't worry about it.
No, I think she has a point.
No, I truly do love them... but I'm also quite fond of sweet tofu pudding.
No, I'm not! I can feel it! Just yesterday\nafternoon, Shichi-kun's...
No, I'm probably imagining things. He looks just like a regular guy...
No, I'm simply helping the family business.\n That was an ad for our shop.
No, I'm the one who should apologize.\nI didn't mean to get on your case like that...
No, I'm worse than that!
No, I've got so much left to say! I just\ndon't know how to put it all into words...
No, I've had enough of you!
No, I... But...
No, Sensei. I'm the one who gave up on\ntrusting anyone.
No, YOU do!
No, and I don't want to either!
No, but!
No, dude... That's a bike...
No, dumbass!
No, his aura is too weak. No wonder I\ncouldn't sense him.
No, it can't be. If that were the case, the\nworld would have already fallen into chaos.
No, it has to be that restaurant! No other\nChinese food can satisfy me!
No, it's a friend of mine!
No, it's a good thing. Kadota's been feeling unmotivated lately, but...
No, it's a trap!
No, it's cool. Um... You're Kano-kun, right?
No, it's just hard to get in there alone!
No, it's just... It'd be rude for a\nfirst-year student like me to challenge\na third-year.
No, it's more like... Have we met somewhere?
No, it's my bad.|What'd you say?
No, it's no problem at all!\nBut when will you be on TV!?\nI'll be sure to watch!
No, it's not here! Not anywhere!\nMr. Higashino, are you sure you lost it\nin the club room?
No, it's not that! I'm sorry, please don't\nmisunderstand!
No, it's not.|You haven't done anything wrong.
No, it's okay. It's all in the past now and\nit's not that serious anyway.
No, it's possible.|Yes, it's impossible.|Pass.
No, let's leave it here for now.
No, let's play another one!
No, no need to worry. There's no sign of\nhis treasure here.
No, no! You're overthinking it! The answer\nis studly looks\u2014something I'm after too!
No, no, I meant it as a compliment.
No, no, I should be saying that. Wait, could\nyou be... another kindred spirit?
No, no, no! She can't be declared a Menace\nfrom just one post!
No, no, nothing like that.
No, no, of course not!
No, no, you can have it! You have all the\nstamps except the diner after all.
No, no. Do I really seem like an\nex-delinquent!?
No, not at all! Glad to be of help!
No, not at all! Well, okay... Maybe a little.
No, not at all. Thank you for buying it for\nme.
No, not at all.|Just do you.
No, not exactly.
No, not in the least.
No, not just now, but\nover and over again...
No, not really.
No, nothing like that. I was never at a loss\nfor words at least.
No, of course not! I don't mean a literal\nsmell, you know.
No, of course not. I don't mind at all. I'm\nin the middle of something now, but we could\nmeet afterwards...
No, of course not...
No, overthinking this is pointless. Besides, I\ndoubt I'd find an answer anyway.
No, really, thank you. You really saved me and Tomoko.
No, really. That's an honest compliment.
No, thank you for listening.
No, thank you! It's really reassuring\nto have you on our side, Riko-senpai!
No, thank you! Really.
No, that is fine. We will wait inside.
No, that voice is definitely {NAME1}.
No, that's my line. Thank you, Ryoko.
No, that's not it. Think carefully now.
No, that's not what I...
No, that's not\u2014!
No, the chosen ones should not betray a man\nwho's shown us such kindness.
No, the disciplinary committee chair\ncan handle it. Students should take care\nof other students.
No, the name Kumi Katayama is definitely\ncausing voices in Mementos to react.
No, there is only one type of fried rice on\nthe menu at Heritage Kitchen...
No, there isn't a particular book I'm\nlooking for. I'm just passing the time.
No, they need two things to become fully realized.
No, this is no mistake. But maybe, just\nmaybe...
No, this isn't a conversation for here.\nIf you wanna talk, follow me.
No, today's just a scrimmage, so we'll do penalty kicks.
No, wait! Even if you cut it, the cycle will\nrepeat if Akashi connects a new cable.
No, wait! Look over there!
No, wait, maybe... Maybe a more natural pose\nwould be a nice change?
No, wait. I sense the same... or even\ngreater power from him than before.
No, wait. They've taken that into\nconsideration too!
No, wait\u2014!
No, we can't take her off the suspect list\nyet. Katayama is a Menace.
No, we can't! Shota-kun picked that name\nfor us!
No, we'd better not. We are the chosen ones,\nafter all.
No, we're actually talking about shaving\nbonito flakes.
No, we've been succeeding on improv and luck\nup until now.
No, you can move all you want. Actually, it's\nyour motion that I want to capture.
No, you waited all this time for me. I should\nbe the one apologizing.
No, you're doing great, {NAME1}-kun.
No, your talent was a ripe fruit just waiting to be plucked.
No. I can't do it. I won't turn this shop, or Victory Kitchen, over to you.
No. I had it in my notebook, so I only\nglanced at the number. I think it started\nwith a 9 maybe?
No. I'm never going there again...
No. If anything,\nI think he's trying to find her weakness.
No. It must be the influence of this world's\nfading desire talking.
No. Just give it a try and you'll understand.
No. That just now is what your mom said.
No. Without more information, all we can do\nis speculate.
No...
No... I haven't done anything special. All I\ncan do is try and be there for her...
No... I should go.
No... I won't hurt...my students...
No... I'll take it as-is.
No... I'm not forcing myself to act like\na teacher.
No... If my understanding is correct, we will\nnot pass through it, but in fact enter the\npainting itself.
No... It seemed like it wouldn't be worth all the trouble.
No... Maybe I'm hearing things...
No... No, no...! AAAAAAGH!
No... Nooooo...!
No... Nothing like that.
No... Stop it... I can't punish them...\nI won't hurt my students!
No... Stop it... I don't want to fight...
No... They won't.
No... You're right, Arai.
No... You're wrong! I\u2014
No... it's not him. He's not the one I\nwas sensing.
No...! No! You can't! It's my only...!
No...|I'm fine...
No.|Motoha chose this herself.
Nobody else around here drinks it!\nYou've gotta join me! C'mon, please!
Nobody's hitting a child around me so long as I've still got sight in this right eye!
Nobody's watching. Or rather, the other\npassengers are too distracted to notice us.
Noge-san from Class D...
Noge-san was just getting me hyped up!
Noge-san's dream...
Noge-san's real unlucky.
None of this is making it into your skulls,\nI see. You kids are trying me today...
None of you have the faintest idea, do you!?
None symbolize that decline better than\nTaira no Kiyomori, who died of fever.
Nonetheless, I have the utmost faith in you.
Nooo! I wanted to play!
Nooo, don't go Rimi-chaaan. Don't ignore meee.
Nooo, the can's stuck in there...
Nooooo!
Nope!
Nope! Thought we'd go somewhere a bit\ndifferent for today's training.
Nope, all good! Wanna hit the underground mall?
Nope, even more. It took over 2,000 years.
Nope, no way! At times like these, let the\nboys take the lead!
Nope, not at all!
Nope, sorry! The right answer was green!
Nope, sorry.
Nope. All we're doing today is securing our infiltration route.
Nope... No good at all.
Nope.|A calico?
Nope.|No experience. Just passion.
Normally, a single human can possess only\none Persona... but you are capable of\nharnessing many more.
Not "like" them, we are Phantom Thieves. Also, my name is Cattle here.
Not a bad idea.|Yum...
Not a bad job, I'd say.
Not a chance.
Not a problem. Your smiles are the only\nthanks we need.
Not a problem.|Leave it to me.
Not a regular teacher? What does that mean?
Not a very efficient study session, I'm\nafraid. You did manage to make some\nprogress, though.
Not after all you've done for the sake of\nyour precious "pride"! A brat like you\ndoesn't know the meaning of the word!
Not again... You stayed up late gaming,\ndidn't you?
Not always, but Tsurumi and Mr. Higashino\ncome to me the moment they need something.
Not as like hardcore training or anything, just simple fun.
Not at all. Anything for the sake of our\nidols and their fans.
Not at all. I just arrived myself. I had\nsomething on my mind is all.
Not at all. I left the entire day open for\nthis. My docket for tomorrow is mostly empty\nas well.
Not at all. Mr. Higashino composes great\nmusic, so I'm excited to see what he comes\nup with.
Not at all. Without Ritsuka's help,\nI would've thrown in the towel.
Not at all... I'm the one who lost my temper\nand jumped on board with the competition.
Not bad at all. I'm certain the customer\nwill be pleased.
Not bad for your first day. It's closing\ntime, so you can leave now.
Not bad, Wonder, not bad at all!
Not bad.
Not bad.|I'm managing.
Not budging, huh?
Not even a little. But I'm kinda glad you\nthink so.
Not even the strongest of bonds can\nclear away the sins of the past...\nA harsh message, indeed.
Not exactly a topic to explore with your students, now was that?
Not exactly. It's a world-class event, so a\ndegree of innovation will be required.
Not exactly...|I'd get a little scared.
Not happening. I can't let everyone down. Not you, not the team, not Nanjo either.
Not just anyone can move and perform like\nthat in that kind of outfit!
Not just anyone could manage raising a child\nand running a business all on her own.
Not just once, but twice!
Not just photos this time?|We're doing video, too?
Not just that, but she can hear my voice as well!
Not knowing what you'll receive only makes\nyou want to spin it more... These capsule\nmachines are the embodiment of desire.
Not like your vote counts for much, Closer.
Not many patients have been coming in lately...
Not move it an inch! The lever must be\nlocked.
Not my crown!
Not one to rely solely on my powers alone,\nI researched my suspicions day and night,\nuntil I discovered the truth.
Not really, because it's on the school's\nrooftop. I've got carrots, tomatoes,\nand more.
Not really... It was more like I thought it was all a dream.
Not really... Like I said, I only learned a\nlittle tiny bit about composing.
Not really...|I'm pretty busy actually!
Not really...|I've got stuff to do.
Not really.|A little, yeah.|It was light as a feather.
Not really.|I have a few.
Not sure... All I know is she lost the\nmotivation for it all of a sudden.
Not sure.|Maybe...?
Not that I don't also turn down my fair share\nof invites from work and class...
Not that I regret buying those five copies.
Not that I regret it or anything, but now\nthis month's looking a little tough...
Not that I'm complaining, but there is\nsomething special about going to a theater!
Not that I'm hoping to get older any\ntime soon!
Not that a monster like him deserves our compassion in the first place.
Not that it isn't still delicious!\nSpicy can be good! But my mouth\nis on fire now...
Not that it matters in nations that use\nthe imperial system...
Not that it's any of our business, I suppose.\nNo matter how much he may resent\nsomeone else.
Not that much, kid! I keep telling you, just focus on school, I can hire some help.
Not that you need to have a reason to talk\nto me. I didn't mean it like that.
Not the only way though. I've got a few\ntricks when it comes to grillin' too.
Not to imply that you're using rifles or\nswords on a daily basis, either.
Not to mention it feels like\nI'm already done for\nthe day...
Not to mention it's piping\nhot! How am I supposed\nto eat this!?
Not to mention that seafood ramen Shun\ntempted me into was amazing, too! Mmm!
Not to mention the Core and everything\nelse... Is it really just a Meta-Nav error?
Not to mention {NAME2}-chan is joining us.\nWe'll demolish all of this no problem!
Not to mention, they didn't even have\ncomputers back then! I could never!
Not to mention, you're the one who makes all\nour break-in tools!
Not too many places I can take you to, huh?
Not true. Having you here gives me courage.
Not yet! We should go get some now!
Not you, too...
Not your fault. My count was off. What a\nrookie mistake. My bad.
Not your nickname, not your social media handle. Your real name.
Not your smell. I can sense waning desire from within the shop.
Notebook, notebook... Huh? Where is it?\nJust when I need it most!
Nothin' motivates me lately. Maybe that'll\nchange if I watch it too?
Nothing beats a nice, baked potato, though.\nAll it needs is a little butter. So simple\nand delicious!
Nothing but cheap shots from this guy...\nI'm not falling for it.
Nothing but losses... This always happens\nto me.
Nothing comes to mind...|I'll pass.
Nothing feels any different, but what do\nyou think?
Nothing going on, nothing to do...
Nothing happened...\nSeems we got the\norder wrong.
Nothing has been planted\nin this area yet.
Nothing in life is certain, you know.
Nothing in particular comes to mind.
Nothing is more satisfying than enjoying a\ngood book, hm? If you have time, you should\nread another.
Nothing really...
Nothing too technical. Just tell me if I'm\nmaking progress or not.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as they\nsay. We ought to feign naivety and just play\nalong.
Nothing's better than a huge plot of open\nland!
Nothing's coming out...\nMaybe it's broken?
Nothing's coming out.\nBad luck, I guess. Oh well...
Nothing's happening.
Nothing's happening...|I wonder why.
Nothing's impossible in Plantopia!\nI'm gonna be a great firefighter someday, just watch!
Nothing...
Now I can avoid the admin staff's icy stares\nand cruel remarks...
Now I can guide you on how to make infiltration tools.
Now I feel I have come to understand you\nand the concept of human desire much more\nthoroughly.
Now I feel like I can tackle things without\nso much weight on my shoulders anymore.
Now I find myself in want of such power. Learning to use it could be very beneficial to us.
Now I just eat whatever I want, but I used\nto bring lunch from home back in middle\nschool.
Now I know I'll never have to worry about\nthe wear and tear!
Now I need to really face myself and create\nmy own form of expression.
Now I realize, I've been working toward being\nboring and one-dimensional\nthis whole time.
Now I see. This park is pretty big and there\naren't many people around now, so we can\nplay without getting in trouble.
Now I wanted a fridge with an ice maker, but of course he said, "I will not be a man with a pink refrigerator!"
Now I'm curious.|What kind of song is it?
Now I'm gonna crush you snot-nosed brats down to size!
Now I'm hearing all kinds of other unsavory rumors about you.
Now I'm here talking to an owl. I'm just rolling with it at this point.
Now I'm not so sure.|......
Now I'm worried about him... I wonder if he's\nlooking after himself properly...
Now I've done it... I never thought it\nwould've turned out like this...
Now all that's left is to prepare for battle!
Now all the infrared devices should be off.\nWell done, Wonder.
Now all there is to do is wait for the broadcast date to be announced.
Now allow me to state my next request.
Now be a good girl and do as you're told. It'll be over soon.
Now both her and Anderson\nhave been fooled... I need to\ntalk to that woman.
Now do you remember me? I am thou...
Now don't get upset, I understand. Whatever trouble my staying here causes, I promise I'll make up for it.
Now don't go on flatterin' me, Shun.
Now for the weather...
Now for your free consultation. This will\nhurt quite a bit.
Now get in! I'll need you to be the driver.
Now get out of my sight. I'm about to have some fun.
Now go get yourselves a good heap of those\ntickets and try it out!
Now he's blocking the way with bales of rice?\nMan, these'll be a pain to move...
Now here I am all the way in Japan, but it\nfeels like a waste.
Now here I thought you were aiming for the majors.
Now hurry up and beg for mercy, Motoha Arai!
Now if you don't mind, let us\nbegin the trial.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back\nto the office.
Now is that a cutting-edge discovery or what!\nToo much so, actually\u2014no one believed him.
Now it's fields and fields as far as the eye\ncan see! Isn't it amazing!?
Now it's time for the goodbye greeting.\nSay it with me!
Now it's time to get our real mission underway.
Now let me see you stampede your students!
Now let us embark on life anew. I am thou...
Now let us make haste. Follow me!
Now let us part. I appreciate your\ncooperation.
Now let's bring our discussion back to Japan.\nThe system of taxation in our country is...
Now let's head to town and buy seeds!
Now let's push on... No, wait.
Now let's track down some tea, huh!?
Now let's try the dumbells!
Now may also be a good time to prepare\nourselves in advance of any trouble we\nmight face.
Now our seeds have plenty of water!
Now our work has officially begun. From here\non we'll need to establish <color=#FF423F>code names</color>\nfor ourselves.
Now remember how a despot's legacy will change depending on whether or not they have the support of the masses?
Now soar ahead, heedless of the muck and\ndark isolation that surround you...
Now take a good look at this beauty!
Now tell me, do you know the name of the\nburger restaurant on Central Street?
Now that I got this power...
Now that I have some free time, I've even\nbeen thinking about growing something at\nmy place.
Now that I think about it, this is your first\ntime on this job, right, {NAME1}-kun?
Now that I think about it,\nthat movie was a test\nof <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>.
Now that I think of it, Lufel\nmust've come in through the\nopen window. I should shut it...
Now that I think of it, you're the first\nperson I've ever opened up to about my\nchildhood, {NAME1}-san.
Now that I understand what I'm trying to do,\nbeing near people who fuss over me...
Now that I'm in the band club,\nthat girl with the guitar\nkeeps grabbing my attention...
Now that I've got your minds warmed up too...\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san, try answering\nthis one.
Now that I've learned how fun it is to ride\nwith someone else...
Now that I've pulled off a performance, I'm a\nbit hungry to do more. You see...
Now that stress is gone, I'm feelin' pretty\nhungry! I think it's time we invite some\ncaramel parfait to this party!
Now that that's been decided...
Now that that's decided, let's get expanding!
Now that that's outta the way, I am a man of\nmy word, so...
Now that there's no immediate threat, could\nyou explain this place to me?
Now that we have Miyazawa's Treasure, we\nshould be able to enter the next area.
Now that we have everything we need, it's\ntime to head back to the farm!
Now that we've agreed to take him in, we've\nbeen messaging back and forth, but um...
Now that we've decided what to call you...
Now that we've made our decision, there's\nmuch to be done!
Now that we've obtained Akashi's password,\nI'm confident we can get through that lock.
Now that we've saved some lost muscles,\nlet's get back to training our own today!
Now that we've secured our base, we must\nprepare to face the threat!
Now that we've secured our route to the\nTreasure, I'll explain the details once we\nreturn to reality.
Now that we've taken its source of power, the Palace is going to disappear!
Now that we've warmed up our muscles...\ncan you tell me what's troubling you?
Now that you mention it, it DID sound like\nMr. Akashi! Tone and everything!
Now that you mention it, this does kind\nof seem like one of those carnival\nhaunted houses...
Now that you mention it, you're right...
Now that you're living a double life, you'll have to learn to study more efficiently.
Now that you're rejuvenated, shall we\nreturn home?
Now that you've conquered the Large-sized\nChallenge, you can proceed to the next stage.
Now that you've read this, you should be able\nto put the knowledge to good use when you\nwork at the flower shop.
Now that's a look of satisfaction. Your\nconcentration was truly a sight to behold.
Now that's a plan!
Now that's decided, we'll need to think of a code name for you, Motoha Arai.
Now that's just plain cold, doncha think?
Now the electrified traps in the big hall\nshould be down. Let's go check.
Now the question is, how do we deliver the calling card? We don't know his office or home address.
Now the world knows you're a clout-chasing\npunk who doesn't know the first thing about\ngood flavor! Wahahahahaha!
Now then, I hope you'll help us find the\ntreasures in the next town as well.
Now then, I won't take anymore of your\ntime...
Now then, I'd like to coordinate our plan\nfor infiltration. Do you have a <color=#FF423F>workbench</color>\nwe can make use of?
Now then, Wonder, let's begin!
Now then, Wonder, let's move.
Now then, how does dinner somewhere other\nthan a bar sound?
Now then, it's time we head home.
Now then, let us take a fan photo together.
Now then, let's get to sleep.
Now then, let's see what fate has in store\nfor you...
Now then, let's try entering the operation\ncommand that Shadow used earlier.
Now then, looks like it's time for...
Now then, once again.
Now then, our contestant's meal is ready for\ntasting!
Now then, shall we head to Yongen-Jaya?
Now then, show me what you're capable of.
Now then, the night's waning. It's been quite the big day of firsts for you. Good work.
Now then, the world is your oyster! Let's do\nwhatever your muscles want to do!
Now then, what kind of books shall we\nencounter today? I must say, I am quite\nexcited.
Now then, where to hold our pep-up planning\npowwow... Where do you feel like,\n{NAME2}-kun?
Now then. I must stress that it's imperative\nto respect that which is not yours, even in\nliterature.
Now then. Would you tell us about this\nPalace? We're entirely unfamiliar with it.
Now then... Lights, camera... Food Fight!
Now there's the issue of our enemies in the\nMetaverse growing stronger. If only we could\nattain a power boost like that...
Now this is the place I really wanted to\ncome to.
Now to copy everything.\nIs there anything else of note?
Now today's forecast looks to be cloudy with a chance of... {PLAYER_NAME}-san! See if you can answer this question.
Now we can begin searching the west wing.
Now we can move to the next area.
Now we can proceed. Well done, Wonder.
Now we can set up a workbench here!
Now we have the 11 members we need to play.
Now we just need to stoke it!
Now we'll have to think of a code name\nfor Kano-kun.
Now we've dipped below 11 members, so we don't have enough players to field a team.
Now what!? You people need to get your shit\ntogether!
Now where am I going to find someone who can rival the likes of the Subway Slammer...?
Now where would one go to pro\u2013
Now you have honed the same ability.
Now you're officially my trusted advisor\nand buddy, Sensei!
Now!
Now! Take the Treasure!
Now, I desire a tour of the school. I wish to\nimmerse myself in this "feeling of youth" for\nmyself.
Now, I know it's a bit sudden, but we have a favor to ask of you, Lady Ann.
Now, I will answer all of your questions as\npromised. Then I would like to speak in more\ndetail about the job I have for you.
Now, I will support you and Naruru with all\nof my heart and soul.
Now, I'd say this is the perfect chance for\nme to see one of your favorite haunts!
Now, I'm gonna pick one of you at random to answer...
Now, a bit of flavor.
Now, ain't this just a sight to behold? It's\nso wonderfully strange... right?
Now, all that remains is putting away the\ncleaning supplies.
Now, come\u2014let us rejoice in the melody that\ndraws forth true might.
Now, drink up.
Now, give Tanemura-san a swift bashing!\nYou can handle that much, can't you?
Now, go get ramen together.|Soy can cook up something.
Now, how about a quiz? Of all this\nparaphernalia...
Now, how to get out... Oh! That could work!
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Now, in place of that video, I will be doing\na live broadcast on the channel!
Now, it's time for ME to ask YOU questions!
Now, kneel before me.
Now, let us hunt for the Treasure.
Now, let us make first contact.
Now, let us proceed with the next phase of\nour special contract.
Now, let your desires run free!
Now, let's conceal ourselves.
Now, let's hear a word from Kiuchi on Arai's performance.
Now, let's retrieve your pay and then we can\ngo home.
Now, let's see you in action!
Now, let's see... Do I take this to the boat\nraces, or the bike races?
Now, now. He may a cat, but he's got a\nremarkably good eye for people.
Now, on to the next bit of training.
Now, on to the next section.
Now, on to the next section. You'd all better\npay attention, or you'll each be getting\na pop quiz!
Now, shall we be on our way?
Now, show me your power to change yourself\nin battle!
Now, sorry to surprise you all during lunch\nhour, but I am here to announce the next\nFood Fight!
Now, suppose your friend from abroad is\nvisiting and you want to get them the perfect\ngift that just screams "Japan"...
Now, to begin, he'd like you to find the six\nremaining treasures hidden here in Zoshigaya.
Now, to the pep up planning powwow! It's at\nthe diner by the way. My treat!
Now, we have just one more ball to find.
Now, we must thoroughly prepare if we wish to\nmake the most of this event.
Now, we've got an important job tomorrow...\nWe're gonna hit that armored truck and rob 'em blind!
Now, what did I tell you?
Now, what to do for today's investigation...\nDo we follow the beaten path or try something\nnew? That is the question.
Now, what will it show us?
Now, where should we\nhang out...
Now, where's Lufel...?
Now, with regard to the documents reportedly\nscattered above Shibuya Station and signed\nby the so-called "Phantom Thieves..."
Now, young man, is this what you were\npurchasing? Or, no, maybe this one?
Now... I'd like to ask your friend something.
Now... where is Joker?
Nue!
Nuh-uh! I got an overall GPA of 1!
Nuh-uh.|You sure you don't mean you?
Nurturing desire with other\nallies of hope...
Nyahaha!
Nyahaha! Perfect! It went exactly as\nI predicted!
O Lord... Is this a sign? Are you telling me\nit is better not to pray?
O divine power... Bring forth today's\nfortune!
O, holy power... Reveal to us the mysteries\nof the cosmos!
O-Oh boy, this is sudden. Um... I've felt the\nsame for a while...
O-Oh dear, the flavor's just not coming\nthrough! Even with the proper tools, it seems\nthere's just a lack of talent here!
O-Oh right... We're kind of inside Cattle's\nbody... Sort of...
O-Oh! Sorry! You must be bored hearing me\ndrone on and on about myself.
O-Oh, really? Great! Um, I'm looking forward\nto it...
O-Oh, um... Thank you all very much!
O-Oh. Were you really that hungry?
O-Oh...
O-Oh... It's you. Hey there.
O-Okay...
OMG, he's suuuper hot...
Observe carefully, Wonder.
Observe them carefully, and see what happens.
Observe.
Obtaining 12 trophies is a feat only\nKiuchi-sama is great enough to achieve!
Obviously it sucks now, but I'll be damned if\nI don't try again. Anyway, thanks for today!
Obviously!
Obviously, my love for baseball didn't fizzle\nwhen she jumped ship.
Obviously. I've worked hard to get this far.
Obviously. Our sales pitch sounds like a\nrip-off when you actually listen to it.
Occasionally my friends come by the shop.\nI hope you can meet them sometime.
Octopus blood is well known to be blue,\nand... Maybe {PLAYER_NAME}-kun\nwill know this one.
Odd? Which do you mean?
Of all the countries, I figured Japan\nwouldn't be too difficult for me to wrap\nmy head around.
Of all this gear, which do you think\nKiuchi-sama replaced most often?
Of course I do! I mean, he's our leader!
Of course I do.|I have plans today...
Of course I know. I'm your teacher after all.
Of course I will.|I'm still a bit worried.|Let's do it!
Of course I won't forgive what he's done, but stealing his desire outright means we're no better than him.
Of course I'm not an unreasonable\ncandidate...
Of course for Pops and Masa-san's sake...\nbut also for all the other shops he's\nhurt too.
Of course going straight home is also a valid option.
Of course it is not something one might\naccept so easily, but you have witnessed it\nfor yourself.
Of course it is.|I can't wait.
Of course it makes her a really kind person... but it also means she doesn't think enough about her own needs.
Of course it makes sense! Don't think about\nit too hard!
Of course it wasn't actually her fault. If anything it was more of an accident, but how do I say this... She...
Of course it's important to take measures to\nprotect our fields, but...
Of course not! Kiyoshi Kurotani is not a man\nwho meekly does as he's told.
Of course not.
Of course that's what you meant! Guess I'll\njust have to keep teaching you!
Of course the line grows the moment Shibuya\ngoes on break...
Of course there's a good chance this will\nget lost in the sea of other posts.
Of course they are!
Of course they would be; it's Riko-senpai's\nfamily business. Gotta go buy some after\nschool today.
Of course this had to change too. This time\nit's a bowl?
Of course we can.|That's up to you.
Of course we did.|Her smile said it all.|You were a fabulous florist.
Of course we need it!|We're counting on you.
Of course we'd always take a detour. Like,\n"Where to today?" Oh, those were the days!
Of course we'll leave out the Phantom Thieves part.
Of course you did. I was blowing things up!
Of course you. Besides... I don't know if I can talk to her right if it's just the two of us.
Of course!
Of course! Cross our hearts!
Of course! Even if you aren't a chosen one,\nwe can still face our battles together.
Of course! Feel free to go for the large size with extra toppings!
Of course! I know it's a little late, but we should celebrate you joining the team.
Of course! I'm sure it'll look amazing on\nyour socials. Make sure the bottle's in the\nshot!
Of course! It's great to see you again!\nAnd how have you been, little muscles?
Of course! Let's hop to it, then.
Of course! Let's take a cute one!
Of course! Meeting you reminded me how fun it\nis to spend time with other people.
Of course! No matter how much we fight,\nas long that energy source persists...
Of course! That guy in there was Hiromu Miyazawa!
Of course! There are some things you can\nonly understand by refining your palate.
Of course! You just did me a huge solid back\nthere. You seem like a great guy!
Of course!|Burn me a CD.
Of course!|I heart Shibuya!
Of course, I did start drinking back in\nthose days...
Of course, I do love my hubby, so let's just\nenjoy Odaiba in a nice, wholesome way.
Of course, I searched every corner there\ntoo, and still nothing.
Of course, I totally get it if you have other\nplans...
Of course, I want all my clients to make\na profit.
Of course, I'm not asking for it for free!\nThis is business. Want to make a deal?
Of course, I'm not opposed to them either!
Of course, Mr. Akashi.
Of course, a drink has to taste good, but it\nhas to look presentable as well.
Of course, it's not like women back then had\nmuch say at all when it came to romance.
Of course, of course, just the reply\nI expected!
Of course, thank you. Well, goodbye then!
Of course, that didn't stop me from being\nhead over heels for my hubby! Hehe.
Of course, that's easier said than done...
Of course, that's not their real name.
Of course, the best thing for circulation is\nweight training! How about it? The gym is\nempty around this time.
Of course, then there is the issue of what\nto do with that fraud of a feline.
Of course, there's something in it for\nyou too.
Of course, this won't spell the end of the\nworld immediately, but...
Of course, we should always expect the\nunexpected.
Of course, we won't know if the same method\nwill really work until we give it a try.
Of course, you may continue searching, but\nI'll leave that decision up to our leader.
Of course, you're free to refuse!
Of course, you're totally welcome! I'll get\nit ready now, so just wait inside.
Of course. Figures it'd be something\nlike that!
Of course. If it's possible, that is...
Of course. It helps relieve fatigue, making\nit popular with athletes.
Of course. Just as idols work to hone\ntheir skills, fans should put forth an effort\nas well.
Of course. Let's meet again.
Of course. My blade will tear them asunder!
Of course. Please use the space freely!\nTanemura-kun, the documents?
Of course. The orange tabby has wandered far\nand wide across all of Tokyo.
Of course. You can count on it.
Of course.|Anytime.
Of course.|Hit me.
Of course.|I might know a place...
Of course.|I'm busy now, sorry.
Of course.|I'm in.
Of course.|I'm not sure I know them all.
Of course.|If you think I can help.
Of course.|Leave it to me!
Of course.|Let's go.
Of course.|Maybe later?
Of course.|My home is your home.
Of course.|She sure is.
Of course.|Sorry, can't...
Of course.|Sure. Can you?
Of course.|The big costumed mascot?
Of course.|Welcome aboard.
Of course.|You can trust us.|Uhhh, sure...
Off to Shibuya.
Off you go now. Be more careful next time, okay?
Off?|What does that mean?
Offering an explanation would be simple\nenough...
Oh I can tell. Even behind that mask it's obvious.
Oh boy! Not gonna lie, that was exhausting...
Oh boy, look at the time. Sorry for keeping\nyou out so late!
Oh boy, so this is Harajuku! Just look at all\nthe hustle and bustle!
Oh boy, this is the life! My tummy's filled\nto the brim!
Oh boy... I can't believe we shopped all the\nway from Shin-Okubo to Shinjuku.
Oh boy...|So what should I do?
Oh brother, enough with the tears and the melodrama. You're making me out like the bad guy.
Oh by the way, I actually went back to the\nbatting cages again on my own.
Oh by the way, did you hear about that "calling card" thing scattered around in Shibuya?
Oh c'mon, relax. They were the ones who\nsaved our butts just now.
Oh crap I forgot... My class has math\nhomework for Katayama-san...
Oh crap! I heard rumors this guy was shady!
Oh crap! Isn't there a school-wide assembly\nthis morning?
Oh crap! Run for it, Mishima!
Oh crap, I can hear 'em coming this way! And\na lot of 'em, too!
Oh crap, Shadows!\nWas that a trap!?
Oh crap, it's already that late?
Oh damn! It's a dam!
Oh dear! I almost forgot, my hubby's coming\nhome early today.
Oh dear! They do not seem pleased with\nour performance!
Oh dear, I've got to get my hubby's\nbreakfast started. See you later, hon!
Oh dear, are all youths these days so insolent? And they say I'm a Menace?
Oh dear, have I told you this already?
Oh dear, he really has overdone it. You there, girl, call an ambulance, would ya?
Oh dear, this is no good. It should be in this area...
Oh dear, this won't do... What ever should\nI do?
Oh forget it, we can continue this later!
Oh god! Why did I say that!?
Oh god, I'm crying. It's just... finally hearing from Tomoko after she was so down...
Oh god, did you think I'd be the same age\nas you?
Oh god, it's them again... They're the two\nthat had that fight with Ms. Katayama.
Oh god, there's Shadows everywhere!
Oh god... What should we do?
Oh good, I do have some.
Oh hellooo! Oh, it went perfectly? Yes, that\nis just fantastic! Thank yooouuu!
Oh hey, Lufel. You've been so quiet and well-behaved. Good boy!
Oh hey, Wonder. Sorry, I was just lost\nin thought.
Oh hey, Wonder. There's something we should\nmaybe run past you.
Oh hey, are you interested in joining the\nsoccer team?
Oh hey, isn't this the accessory that was all\nover social media for a while?
Oh hey, look at that!
Oh hey, perfect timing, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun.\nI wanted to talk to you about Kotone-san's\ncheer song.
Oh hey, {NAME1}. Can you come to\npractice today?
Oh look, there's that temper of yours again.
Oh look, your little friends are here. What's with all these damn intruders?
Oh man, I can feel my face burning up...\nIt's nice to meet you too! Haha...
Oh man, I might not be able to think about\nanything else now!
Oh man, I think I'm starting to feel woozy...
Oh man, I want that one. Can you trade\nwith me? Er, I mean, you don't have to\nif you don't wanna...
Oh man, it's been so long since I've\nbeen here!
Oh man. Realizing now I should've gone in\nwith more of a plan. Sorry...
Oh man... Whenever someone asks me to\ntake pictures, they always come out blurry\nand awkward-looking.
Oh my god! She's, like, a songwriting genius!
Oh my god! Sorry! Are you guys okay?
Oh my god! Your voice is amaaaazing!
Oh my god, I bought way too much last week.\nI need a part-time job, like, ASAP.
Oh my god, that's got to be a criminal offense! Did you file a report?
Oh my god, there's a cat in the school!?\nI wish I'd seen it!
Oh my god, what do I do!? I've never seen\na real celebrity up close before!
Oh my goodness! I forgot to introduce myself.
Oh my gosh I'm so fricken excited! Come on,\nSensei! The browsing awaits!
Oh my! Do I look like a high schooler to you?
Oh my! It is you!
Oh my! It really did have the key!
Oh my! Sounds like someone's in a pickle.
Oh my! What a coincidence, running into\nyou in place like this.
Oh my! You certainly have a way with words.
Oh my, is it really that messy? Well when\nyou need a hand, just say the word, okay\n{NAME2}-chan?
Oh my, look at the time! I've got to get dinner started.
Oh my, that was delectable.
Oh my, you are such a kind young man! Thank you so very much.
Oh my. I'm getting a bit too excited.
Oh my...
Oh my... It looks like an obstacle is\nblocking the way!
Oh my... What do we have here?\nI must be seeing things. Is that a\nhuman challenger!?
Oh my... You've been blessed with such\nwonderful students, Kumi-chan.
Oh no!
Oh no! I forgot I left my hubby's pillowcase\nout to dry!
Oh no! I forgot something important!
Oh no! I forgot the vice principal wanted\nto meet with me!
Oh no! I forgot to return the umbrella!
Oh no! I have to go and iron hubby's shirts.
Oh no! I haven't introduced myself yet.
Oh no! It seemed so promising, but luck\nwasn't on our side...
Oh no! Kintsuba is hubby's favorite sweet!
Oh no! Look at the monitor!
Oh no! The liquid's seeping through! Aaaah!
Oh no! The roots are weak!
Oh no! The soil is drying out!
Oh no! What do I do!? I can't let a kid catch\na cold because of me!
Oh no, I'm sure that can't be true. Everyone knows that doctor's a fraud!
Oh no, no, no... Not again!
Oh no, sorry! I'm keeping you waiting again!
Oh no. But... why?
Oh no...
Oh no... Don't tell me it flew away\nsomewhere...
Oh no... It's gone...
Oh no... That's... I mean, that sounds so...
Oh nooo, you're scaring me! Please stop\nyelling, okaaay?
Oh nothing.
Oh please, don't worry about that. I'm just\nimpressed!
Oh really? In that case, won't you need\nsome original music to perform?
Oh really? Is that so?
Oh right! Did you solve today's first\nquestion, {NAME2}?
Oh right! Here's your phone. It looks like\nit wasn't scratched or anything, but...
Oh right! That makes sense...
Oh right! Where's the Treasure!?
Oh right, I guess we'll have to look for\nproblems going on in the real world and go\nfrom there.
Oh right, my apologies. We came back here\nso you could rest.
Oh right, sorry! I guess you can't hold chopsticks.
Oh right, still mid-introduction. Ahem.
Oh right, that way we can get to the station\non foot.
Oh right, we should get each other's contact info.
Oh right. Could I get your names? I'm\nsupposed to keep track of the winners.
Oh right. Gotta be careful or I might end up\na Menace.
Oh right. I haven't even asked you what your\nname is yet, have I?
Oh right. Is it okay if we exchange\ncontact info?
Oh right. It was his old employee ID number.
Oh sorry, are you on your way to school\nright now? That's the uniform for <color=#FF423F>Kokatsu\nAcademy</color>, isn't it?
Oh stop! That makes me sound like a criminal.
Oh sure, hang up on me, why don't you!?
Oh that's right, Shun's been eating his\ncup ramen up here for a while now.
Oh that's right, you said you had something to tell us.
Oh that's right. You are the\nHit-and-Run Rider, after all.
Oh too bad. I'm in Shibuya today, so let me know\nif you find the time!
Oh wait, there are hints here? This might not\nbe so hard then. Hm...
Oh wait, you said your parents are out of the\ncountry now, right?
Oh wait. Maybe you did say something along\nthose lines and I just didn't catch it...
Oh well, no matter. You should start eating while it's still hot, {NAME2}.
Oh well. I'm sure you're feeling a bit more\nlimber and dextrous just from reading\nabout it, right?
Oh well. Maybe I can just crop the photo\nso he's not visible...
Oh would you just\u2014
Oh wow! I don't think I've ever seen a\nhigh school language arts textbook before!
Oh wow! That sounds like something a phantom\nthief would say! So cool!
Oh wow, so this is how you think it ought\nto be, huh? Your world must be a total mess!
Oh wow, this takes me back. I haven't been\nhere in forever.
Oh yeah! High schoolers can work part-time!\nWow, that sounds so fun!
Oh yeah! I can also give you all my tips and\ntricks for swinging the bat.
Oh yeah! I remember that!\nI was wondering what he was doing there!
Oh yeah! Like you suddenly want to eat\nsomething even without watching a food\nvideo or anything!
Oh yeah! That contest is super soon.\nThe High School Battle of the Bands!
Oh yeah! That makes sense. I bet that's\nwhat it is!
Oh yeah! When we first saw him, he stuck a\ncable into the ground to heal himself!
Oh yeah! You weren't attacked by Shadows,\nuh... I mean, monsters, were you!?
Oh yeah! {NAME2} got hit once on\nthe train!
Oh yeah, I forgot! You haven't picked a\ncode name yet!
Oh yeah, I head a rumor some vending\nmachines in Shibuya play rap music!
Oh yeah, I heard that a pro shogi player\ncomes here to mull over her strategies...
Oh yeah, I heard those boys at the assembly\nasking for free vending machines.
Oh yeah, I saw you guys were paired up at gym class.
Oh yeah, I still\nhaven't eaten yet...
Oh yeah, I think the Shadow we saw earlier\nsaid something about guarding!
Oh yeah, I totally feel that!
Oh yeah, I wanted thank you for last time.\nHere, take this specialty drink.
Oh yeah, doesn't that limited edition figure\ngo on sale tomorrow?
Oh yeah, how did things go with your coach?\nWere you able to make up?
Oh yeah, it's a deal! Weapon swapping and\nstuff like that sounds unreal!
Oh yeah, it's a film studio! This isn't a real castle, it's a set made to look like a castle.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Oh yeah, totally.
Oh yeah, totally.|Maybe something more subdued?|Why not pair it with this?
Oh yeah, we can get in from there, right?
Oh yeah, we could use one of those.
Oh yeah, we were just talking about our next job.
Oh yeah, you're right. Cheese is low in\ncarbs.
Oh yeah, you've got a point there.
Oh yeah. At this point, who even knows\nwhat's a main dish and what's a side?
Oh yeah. Had the same pretentious lilt to\nit too.
Oh yeah. I guess someone could overhear us in\nclass or the hallways.
Oh yeah. It said something about "consulting"\ntoo, didn't it?
Oh yeah. Now that I think of it, I don't know what intoxication feels like in the first place, hahaha.
Oh yeah. The Metaverse and the real world are supposed to be linked somehow, right?
Oh yeah? I'm sure you can't!
Oh yeah? No problem then. If you're PSYCHIC.
Oh yeah? What for?
Oh yeah? You think I shouldn't kick back\nand relax now that I'm retired, huh.
Oh yes, I am. If you know that, you\nmust be...
Oh yes, I did see the news. Oh, I was so surprised.
Oh yes, hello! Sorry, was no one at\nthe shop?
Oh yes, she's doing well. She'll be on the\nfarm again today, I'm sure.
Oh yes, that dish looked quite tasty!\nI thought I'd like to try it at least once...
Oh yes, you can hear much the same at\nKoshien.
Oh {NAME2}-chan, you diligent young man!\nI wish my son was here to hear this.
Oh!
Oh! <color=#FF423F>Leo</color>-chan.
Oh! Actually, I'd been dating this guy\nrecently, but...
Oh! Akashi's Shadow is weak and can only\nfeed off other Shadows!
Oh! And I've been thinking...
Oh! And no flying allowed!
Oh! And they should sell more baked goods!\nI'd looove some sweet pastries!
Oh! Are you trying to say that you're\nlacking energy?
Oh! As thanks for ordering so much...
Oh! But since I'm working here, I should wear\nsomething to show off the product, right!?
Oh! Good morning, {NAME2}-chan!
Oh! Good to see ya, Wonder.
Oh! Guess it went well then.
Oh! Hello there, Russet.
Oh! Hey, {NAME1}-kun. Are you busy today?
Oh! How about we give our victory party a do-over? We could go back to Victory Kitchen!
Oh! How stupid am I!? I forgot the most\nimportant thing!
Oh! Howdy, <color=#FF423F>Yukimi</color>-san!
Oh! I bet that's why there's so many dessert\nflavored protein shakes!
Oh! I should ask my housekeeper to look...
Oh! I'll hold you to that, Shun! In fact, you\ncan make it every day if you want!
Oh! I'll walk you home!
Oh! I-I know, why don't the three of us play?\nWe can find a time that works, and\u2014
Oh! If I had some of those carrots and\ntomatoes, I could make a dish I really love!
Oh! If we did that, everyone could gather\nhere to cook together. Sounds like a lot\nof fun!
Oh! It looks like you've found all of the\nhidden treasures in Yongen-Jaya.
Oh! It should be like a treasure hunt!\nShota-kun's part of the Exploration Team\nafter all!
Oh! It's Masa-san.
Oh! It's the orange tabby!
Oh! It's {NAME2}!
Oh! Let's go to yum cha at one of those shops\nover there!
Oh! Like how you guys investigated Miyazawa\nbefore I became a phantom thief.
Oh! Look, there's a camera over there, too.\nIt looks different from the others.
Oh! Maybe if I heard you all play this...\nWe worked so hard on this song...
Oh! Me too, me too!
Oh! Morning!
Oh! Really? Then let's go! This time it's a\nbeef bowl place in Shibuya.
Oh! Remember that one time in class?
Oh! Right, Cattle told me about that. Still,\njust seeing them is hard to take.
Oh! Right, of course! I'm more of a rice\nperson as well!
Oh! So a ramen joint, right?
Oh! So because we have the Treasure, we're mistaken for holding intense desire...
Oh! Sorry to surprise everyone!\nMs. Katayama is um... Ummm...
Oh! Sorry!
Oh! Subdued would be better? I'll, uh, keep\nthat in mind!
Oh! Thanks for the meal, Riko-senpai!
Oh! That's just wonderful! My grandson is\ngoing to be delighted when he sees this.
Oh! That's mine!
Oh! That's very impressive. That'll probably\nbe enough on its own.
Oh! Then at some point the Palace\nmight show up again, right?
Oh! There it is!
Oh! This is kind of like give and take, right? Wow, we really are like phantom thieves!
Oh! Tomoko-san! And {NAME2}-kun! You're\nworking here today?
Oh! Tomoko-san, {NAME2}-kun.
Oh! Um...
Oh! Um... But of course, that's not the only\nreason I wanted to come here today!
Oh! Um... You didn't hear that... Hahaha.
Oh! Wait, Closer! I know we didn't have\nmuch time to talk, but...
Oh! We're both on today. How lucky!
Oh! We're on together again today. Nice!
Oh! Welcome back, Leo-chan.
Oh! Well, um, in that case...
Oh! What if Lufel drops them from the sky\nabove the station like last time?
Oh! What if we all split it? I wanted to give\nit a try too anyway!
Oh! Why don't we eat lunch together today?\nWe could go to the rooftop and...
Oh! Y-yeah, true. It might not be as scary \nif I watch it with you, {NAME2}...
Oh! Yamagoshi-san must know some way we can\nconvince Kano-kun to back out of the fight!
Oh! Yeah, it's me. Hello!
Oh! Yeah, that could work.
Oh! Yes, you're right! They really do!
Oh! You over there!
Oh! You there...
Oh! You're that figure skater!
Oh! {NAME2}-kun! Fancy meeting you here.
Oh, Fujikawa-san.
Oh, Haruna-chan! It's been so long!
Oh, I almost forgot. Have you ever played before?
Oh, I almost forgot. There's something I\nwanted to ask you.
Oh, I also had an idea for a school event!\nI would looove if we could hold\na baseball tournament!
Oh, I always buy that from food stands.
Oh, I can't wait till they're ready! We'll\nhave ourselves the largest cyber potatoes\never!
Oh, I didn't introduce myself.\nI'm <color=#FF423F>Minami Miyashita</color>.
Oh, I didn't mean to sound like I was\ncriticizing you.
Oh, I didn't put alcohol in it. You don't\nhave to worry.
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late already!
Oh, I don't have any such special skills.
Oh, I don't think that's it... I wanted the\none I saw online, with strawberries in it.
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.
Oh, I get it! Then I'll just wait and see.
Oh, I get it!\nI should try that...
Oh, I guess I don't need to be worried about you then. Still... take care of yourself.
Oh, I guess I must have worried you too.\nSorry about that, but thank you!
Oh, I guess I should explain.
Oh, I guess so. That is a weird thing to ask\nsomeone out of nowhere, isn't it?
Oh, I guess we haven't met before. Hi, I'm\nPanther.
Oh, I guess you could interpret that multiple ways, huh?
Oh, I have an idea. Would you like to\naccompany me to the bookstore?
Oh, I haven't even introduced myself yet. Chizuko Nagao, a 75-year-old granny.
Oh, I knew it...
Oh, I know her! She's actually...
Oh, I know the one about the flowerbeds! It's something like...
Oh, I know! How about I serve him up a\ntasty meal?
Oh, I know! It's like a Safe Room!
Oh, I know! Nothing says "heading home from\nschool" like buying a yummy treat on the way!
Oh, I know! Since we don't have one, I'll\nmake my own!
Oh, I know. Seeing as we're talking about\nRob Roy... how about a math question\ninvolving cattle?
Oh, I like that one too! It's so good!
Oh, I meant to ask how you felt. Like, "The ball was fast!", or "I felt amazing!" Any thoughts like that?
Oh, I never knew they were so famous!
Oh, I recognize this! There was a calling\ncard just like this for the Subway Slammer!
Oh, I see! Even in different worlds, some\nthings are the same.
Oh, I see! Well, any fan of Shichi-kun must\nbe a good person!
Oh, I see, nice! I could go for one of\nthose, too!
Oh, I see. Are you a student?
Oh, I see. Okay, then! Let me give it a try!
Oh, I see. Ping me next time you're\navailable.
Oh, I see. Rather than a substitute for\nalcohol, it's a new way to drink tea for me.
Oh, I see. Sorry to bother you.
Oh, I see...
Oh, I see... Come back and hear me out when\nyou've got a minute.
Oh, I see... Don't worry about it then.\nJoin me another time, okay?
Oh, I see... Fussing over Leo-chan would just\nmake it harder on him.
Oh, I see... Meh, it happens. Join me next\ntime, okay?
Oh, I suppose they had those 3D glasses when\nI was a kid. You know, with the red and blue\nlenses?
Oh, I take it this isn't the first time this\nconversation's happened.
Oh, I totally will!
Oh, I was practicing some flair bartending\nmoves. I work here as a bartender.
Oh, I wouldn't dare...! This is called a\nmocktail. It's nonalcoholic.
Oh, I'll get them!
Oh, I'm getting fired up now! Playtime is\nover for you kids.
Oh, I'm glad to hear so! Ah, so cute...
Oh, I'm not sure... I'll ask later, okay?
Oh, I'm really sorry! It just slipped my mind\nwhile I was out...
Oh, I'm so glad we're on the same page!
Oh, I'm sorry! I've just been talking this\nwhole time.
Oh, I'm sorry! Look at me just gabbing away. You'll be late for school!
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just thinking\nabout something.
Oh, I'm sorry. Um... Please let me stay\nlike this.
Oh, I'm sorry. You must think I'm totally\nbuggin', asking you that out of nowhere.
Oh, I'm sorry.\nIt's already the time that we agreed to meet,\nisn't it?
Oh, I've been waitin' for you, {NAME2}.
Oh, I've heard of that one before. I play\na lot of card games myself.
Oh, Kotone-san!
Oh, Kyo-kun, Yuna-chan! What do you\nwanna eat?
Oh, Lufel, I didn't know you were the type to hold a grudge. Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers!
Oh, Minami, you know this guy?
Oh, Motoha, Tomoko. And {NAME1}-kun too.
Oh, Mr. Higashino, could you do the paperwork\nfor us to perform in the competition?
Oh, Riko-senpai. Sorry about that. I just\ndidn't want his phone to break, so I...
Oh, Russet, you're such a kidder!
Oh, Sensei! I'm thinking today's the day to\ntalk to Yukimi-san.
Oh, Sensei. I received a care package from\nmy parents, and it was full of scrumptious\ntea.
Oh, Sensei. Your timing never ceases\nto amaze me.
Oh, Tanemura-san...
Oh, Tanzo's usual routine has begun! It must\nbe hard to become a first-class artisan\nlike him.
Oh, Wonder-senpai! I was just reviewing my\nrhythmic gymnastics routine.
Oh, Wonder. Nice to see you.
Oh, Yukimi-san! I'm so glad you could make\nit today!
Oh, a customer?
Oh, a present for me?
Oh, about that... I only really do it for\nregulars, but...
Oh, all right. I'll just let her know. We'll\nfigure out a day that works for all of us.
Oh, all right...
Oh, almost forgot. Here's the reward I\npromised you.
Oh, and I bet I know why! Maybe it's because\nshe sits near you in class!
Oh, and I bet there are places around here\nlooking for part-time staff.
Oh, and I want to get Motoha a souvenir. Let\nme know if you want me to get you anything,\n{NAME1}-kun.
Oh, and Lufel? About our next job...
Oh, and about what happened this morning... I'm sure many of you've already heard, but...
Oh, and feel free to use my kitchen. Eat\nsomething before you leave.
Oh, and leave the location to me!
Oh, and make sure to let me know when you wanna go into the Metaverse. I'll rush right over. See you later!
Oh, and make sure to write your name on the top.
Oh, and our distributor hasn't come today.\nIf we call them now, maybe they can make it!
Oh, and remember you can't pick out the\nmedicine for the customer. You're not a\npharmacist, after all.
Oh, and since I'm the one who invited you,\nI'll take care of the bill.
Oh, and since you've been such a\nfantabulous customer...
Oh, and some boys asked for\nfree vending machines too.
Oh, and there should be a post for band club\non the club bulletin board with more details,\nso be sure to check it out!
Oh, and we can't forget we're students before\nanything else. We've gotta study and... Ugh!\nThere's just not enough time in the day!
Oh, and you can solve the puzzles\nwith him too!
Oh, and {NAME2}, don't hold back on your\norder just cause I am.
Oh, another video is starting.
Oh, anyway, as I was saying...
Oh, are we a contrarian now? Annoyingly\nenough, you're correct.
Oh, are you one of that <color=#ff0000>orange\ntabby's</color> friends?
Oh, are you participating in the\npuzzle challenge?
Oh, are you ready to go?
Oh, before I forget. You said the Takemi Medical Clinic, right? I just looked it up, so I'll send you the address.
Oh, believe me, I'm aiming for the bleachers!\nAhahaha!
Oh, bummer! My nail polish is starting\nto peel!
Oh, but I do still want to continue our\ninvestigations together. Is that all right\nwith you, {NAME1}-san?
Oh, but I guess it would be a pain to go pick\nup your bass now...
Oh, but I guess there's nothing for you to\nget out of this, huh?
Oh, but I guess they do use the momme for pearls.
Oh, but I guess they don't sell any real guns...
Oh, but bringing here to a crowded place all of a sudden could be too much...
Oh, but didn't you say security would tighten since we were found out last time?
Oh, but first, we'd better do some warm-ups!
Oh, but first...
Oh, but if I go digital, I can get new books\nthe minute they come out!
Oh, but if we're gonna try them all, we'll\nneed some tea too.
Oh, but since you're here...
Oh, but the rehab I went through must be\nnothing like what you have to do to get back\nin the rink, right?
Oh, but wait. We have to give it to him in a way that he won't realize it's us, right? How are we supposed to do that?
Oh, but we had curry just yesterday. Won't he\nget sick of having it two nights in a row?
Oh, but what am I saying this to you for...
Oh, but, I'm actually doing fine now. My\nrehab's been over for a while!
Oh, by the way, how's your memory, Lufel? Has the Treasure helped you remember anything?
Oh, by the way, {NAME2}!
Oh, by the way. If you cause any problems for me, the deal's off.
Oh, by the way...
Oh, c'mon! If you think the hat's irrelevant to the case, then just say that!\nOr doncha have the guts to admit to your mistakes!?
Oh, come on!
Oh, come on, I told you about her before.\nShe's my next-door neighbor!
Oh, come on. I'd be totally freaked if I had to go it alone. It's good knowing you've got my back.
Oh, come on...
Oh, dear! You're a sweet kid, but you still\nneed to learn what a girl wants to hear.
Oh, did you already have plans? Come by again\nwhen you're free.
Oh, did you finish reading "The Chivalrous\nJ\xe1no\u0161\xedk"?
Oh, did you finish the puzzle challenge?\nYou can pick up your prize here!
Oh, didn't I meet you two the other day?
Oh, do we have any bandages left?
Oh, do you think that might be from...
Oh, does he now!
Oh, don't be shy if you have any requests.\nI'll keep 'em in mind for next time.
Oh, don't misunderstand though. I don't want\nyou to spend more money on me or anything!
Oh, don't tell me you're worried about me.\n...That's very kind of you, friend.
Oh, don't you work at the convenience store?\nHim too...
Oh, er, I got a little carried away there,\nthat's all...
Oh, get a grip! You're a grown man. Stop acting so pathetic.
Oh, glad to hear you're on board! Time\nto bust out the mop and bucket. To\n{NAME2}-chan's house!
Oh, good idea! Let's go have a look!
Oh, good idea! Maybe Magatsukami will comment\non it!
Oh, good morning. You look tired.
Oh, good thinkin'!
Oh, gotcha. Sorry. Let's watch the movie when\nyou've got time, then.
Oh, great leader Wonder-sama! Please deliver\nus from crappy artwork!
Oh, great timing!
Oh, have you already arrived in Shinjuku?
Oh, have you tried the new dessert from the\ncaf\xe9 by the station?
Oh, hello there, Russet!
Oh, hello there, Russet. Your timing couldn't\nbe better!
Oh, hello there, Yaoling.
Oh, hello!
Oh, hello! It's nice to see you again.
Oh, hello. So, I made a little mistake\nat school...
Oh, hellooo! Please take a seat.
Oh, here's a pitch! Let's play "Who looks\nweakest?" I spy a young lady in uniform.
Oh, here's the book I promised. Consider\nit... proof of our resolve and a memento of\nour fated meeting.
Oh, hey there.
Oh, hey! Do you happen to have anything\nto write with?
Oh, hey! You're here!
Oh, hey, Mr. Akashi. Are you here to buy\nlunch too?
Oh, hey, sorry about that. My mouth got away\nfrom me all of a sudden.
Oh, hey, {NAME1}-kun! How's your day\nlooking?
Oh, hey, {NAME1}-kun. I could really use\nyour advice today...
Oh, hey, {NAME1}. Let's kill it today!
Oh, hey, {NAME2}-kun! You like coming to\nInokashira Park too?
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey. Is <color=#FF423F>Joker</color> not with you?
Oh, hi. Care to join me while I take some\nmore photos?
Oh, hold up. I gotta get ingredients first.\nDo you live near a supermarket?
Oh, how chivalrous of you. So this garden-y\narea...
Oh, is that Ito-san!? It's been so long!
Oh, is that it? Guess you're probably right.
Oh, is that {NAME2}-chan?
Oh, is that...?
Oh, is this...?
Oh, it's a notification for Miyazawa's\nchannel! He uploaded some new video!
Oh, it's almost time for work and I just took\nout a big loan, so I need to get fired up.
Oh, it's fine now! It doesn't even hurt\nanymore!
Oh, it's getting late. Let's wrap up practice\nfor today.
Oh, it's just... Like Mona-senpai, you said\nyou're not a real owl... right?
Oh, it's not what you think. I just overheard\nthe voice of your muscles, and...
Oh, it's nothing serious. Just telling\nAshiya-san about some of my old battles.
Oh, it's nothing, really.
Oh, it's worth mentioning we sometimes have\nsale days which attract huge crowds\nof customers.
Oh, it's you again. My old friend.
Oh, it's you! Did you bring the flower pot?
Oh, it's you, {NAME2}.
Oh, it's you.
Oh, it's you. Sorry, I kind of spaced out\nfor a moment there...
Oh, it's you... The "coach." {PLAYER_NAME}...\nright?
Oh, it's you... What'll it be today?
Oh, it's {NAME1}-kun.
Oh, it's {NAME2}-kun!\nHowdy there!
Oh, just hurry up and pick something!
Oh, let me know if you don't actually\nlike coffee, though. I can get you\nsomething else.
Oh, let me show you to your seats. Right\nthis way!
Oh, look at me babbling. Let's get back on\ntrack. Cleaning! That's why we're here!
Oh, look at me ramblin' on!
Oh, look at that!\nThere's a grate in the way!
Oh, look over there! There's something\nby the camera.
Oh, look! That's my neighborhood over there!\nI wonder if I can see my house?
Oh, looks like we can control the robot with this!
Oh, maybe you're saying there's a lack of a\nunifying theme amongst the subjects?
Oh, my apologies. These are smart glasses.\nBasically a smartphone for your eyes.
Oh, my bad. No, it doesn't have to be now.\nWhenever works for you.
Oh, my mom's calling for me, so I've\ngotta go. See you later!
Oh, n-no, it's nothing all that grand...
Oh, nice! Then why don't we give that a try?
Oh, nice! Yeah, you gotta use\nthe right equipment if you want results!
Oh, nice. I was thinkin' the same.
Oh, no need to worry about that! The club's\nvice president is Ritsuka Takanashi...
Oh, no reason! I was just wondering.
Oh, no! You don't need cash. Instead, it\ntakes these P Medals!
Oh, no, I go to the same specialty shop in\nKichijoji that I've always used.
Oh, no, I'm sorry! It was insensitive of me\nto ask...
Oh, no, Sensei. There's no need to start\nfussing over me all of a sudden.
Oh, no, it's nothing like that... I'm just\nmaking a video.
Oh, no. There's no rice.
Oh, no. We just followed the manual and\nwhatnot.
Oh, not bad. You really do know your way\naround a kitchen. This is perfectly seasoned.
Oh, now that you mention it, Mr. Akashi\ndid say something like that to her.
Oh, now you're talkin'! That would be great!
Oh, of course I meant that in a good way!\nYou're just awful sometimes, you little\nplayer...
Oh, of course! Feel free to come by whenever\nyou like.
Oh, of course, I won't charge you a dime,\n{NAME2}-chan. How could I after everything\nyou've done for me?
Oh, okay then! Welcome to the team, Wind!
Oh, okay. I'd still like you to try it some\ntime when you're free.
Oh, okay. Lemme know when you're around!
Oh, okay. That's too bad. Could we talk when\nyou do have some time?
Oh, okay. Well, let's hang out some other\ntime.
Oh, okay...
Oh, okay... Another time then.
Oh, okay... In that case, let's pick a time\nwhen we're all free.
Oh, okay... That's fine.
Oh, our caf\xe9's theme is idols! I guess that\nkind of makes me one.
Oh, perfect timing, {NAME2}! Guess what?
Oh, please don't slouch like that. It slows\ncirculation, which is bad for your muscles\nand can make you feel cold more often.
Oh, pshaw! That's what being a florist's all\nabout!
Oh, r-really?
Oh, really! You're all together then!
Oh, really!? You would?
Oh, really?
Oh, really? I never buy a book because of\nthe author.
Oh, really? Let's try going there, then!
Oh, really? Okay, let's go check there.
Oh, really? That'd be great. Thanks!
Oh, really? That's too bad...
Oh, really? Then I guess I'll go look!
Oh, really?\nThanks, kid!
Oh, right! Don't slurp too fast or you'll get\ncovered in curry.
Oh, right! Here's your book!
Oh, right! Mom, do you have something to\nwrite with?
Oh, right, I should mention I'm not great\nwith thrill rides...
Oh, right, if the pain from the cut gets more severe, go see a doctor right away!
Oh, right, thanks for helping me\nstudy earlier.
Oh, right. A token of my thanks. Hold on just\na second.
Oh, right. Here's the address Leo-chan left\nbehind.
Oh, right. I brought home some snacks.
Oh, right. I guess there was a big fight\nlast time, too.
Oh, right. I guess you won't know everything\nabout it then.
Oh, right. I was talkin' about curry roux,\nwasn't I?
Oh, right. I'd like you to lend me an ear.
Oh, right. Isn't this area known for curry?\nThe curry bread must be delicious, then!
Oh, right. Maybe I should ask Mona to let\nme drive next time?
Oh, right. That's why I came to you in the\nfirst place.
Oh, right. We did activate it from inside\nthe train this time.
Oh, right. When I get lost in thought, I lose\ntrack of what's goin' on around me.
Oh, right. You should give that book\nright there a read some time.
Oh, right...
Oh, right... About the recent <color=#FF423F>Menace</color>\nincidents.
Oh, right... I didn't know you had to pay for\nthat. Urgh, curse you expensive land...!
Oh, right... I'm Queen. Nice to meet you.
Oh, right... Sorry, I still have trouble\nremembering exactly what it's called.
Oh, school's almost over. Wanna head to the\nstation together?
Oh, seeing him stand defiantly against that\nwigged jerk really had my heart racing!
Oh, so how are things with you lately? Any good news?
Oh, so it wasn't just an act...\nThat explains it.
Oh, so like, exercising by moving heavy stuff\naround? Good idea! I'll check if\nany are hiring!
Oh, so that's what was up?
Oh, so the creator of kabuki was a woman?\nBut later, women were strictly banned from\nperforming it... Interesting.
Oh, so then he's like Wonder!
Oh, so you know about Palaces too! So,\nyou're saying this place...
Oh, so you're a regular of ours?\nThank you so much for your patronage.
Oh, so you're also in a band! I made mine\nwith my friends in high school too.
Oh, so you're one of them?
Oh, sorry for making this about me again.\nI know I'm being a drag.
Oh, sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.\nI mean he should be fine on his own.
Oh, sorry! Didn't mean to talk your ear off. The train's coming, so let's talk later, okay?
Oh, sorry! Guess I oughta introduce myself\nto the muscles' owner too, huh?
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize it was a big deal\nfor you. Whenever you're ready is fine!
Oh, sorry, but I think that might do more\nharm than good.
Oh, sorry. Did you say something? I was\ndeep in thought.
Oh, sorry. I forgot to mention, you made the team just now.
Oh, sorry. I guess it was kinda last minute.\nMaybe another time?
Oh, sorry. I just blurted out what I was\nthinkin'.
Oh, sorry. I shouldn't be holding you up.
Oh, sorry. When I get absorbed in something,\nI forget what's goin' on around me.
Oh, sorry...
Oh, sounds like you can deal with horror\npretty well.
Oh, speaking of... aren't your folks out of\nthe country for a while?
Oh, thank goodness! Welcome home, Leo-chan.
Oh, thank goodness. I'm so glad.
Oh, thank you!
Oh, thank you! I thought you only came by for\nMerope-chan's sake...
Oh, thank you.|You're so well prepared.
Oh, thanks! I'll go take a look.
Oh, that could be good! Let's try it out!
Oh, that makes sense! The kind of stuff\nyou'd see on a kids' menu!
Oh, that means this is the place, right,\nCattle?
Oh, that reminds me!
Oh, that reminds me. Have you ever grown\nplants in real life, Russet?
Oh, that reminds me. I found a great coffee\nshop the other day.
Oh, that wasn't coming from me, okay?\nIt's what Shichi-kun said yesterday!
Oh, that's a good idea! Okay, {NAME2}\ncan take the lead!
Oh, that's a good one. It'll be a challenge,\nthat's for sure.
Oh, that's a shame. I bet Skull would be\noverjoyed to hear you're a ramen chef.
Oh, that's a shame. I would've liked to have\na chat...
Oh, that's a shame... Feel free to come by again\nwhen your curiosity's piqued!
Oh, that's brilliant! But I doubt it's a\ntwo-digit passcode.
Oh, that's fine! Sorry for springing it on you, I'll ask another time.
Oh, that's it!
Oh, that's it! The voice sounded just like\nMr. Akashi's!
Oh, that's it! With these numbers, how about\nhot pot? And we can finish the soup by\nadding rice afterward.
Oh, that's nice. It fits you perfectly too.
Oh, that's not a problem. My room gets plenty\nof sunlight.
Oh, that's perfect then!
Oh, that's perfect! I guess you have a bit of\na sweet tooth then?
Oh, that's right! Did you need something?
Oh, that's right! I said I'd thank you\nproperly this time, but I didn't bring\nanything!
Oh, that's right, I have\nsomething Merope might like...
Oh, that's right, I have\nsomething Shun might like...
Oh, that's right, I have\nsomething Tomoko might like...
Oh, that's right, I have\nsomething Yaoling might like...
Oh, that's right, I have\nsomething Yui might like...
Oh, that's right,\nI have something\nTomiyama might like...
Oh, that's right. I could smell the presence\nof more than one.
Oh, that's right. I have\nsomething Motoha might like...
Oh, that's too bad. Later then!
Oh, that's too bad. Let's hang out some\nother time!
Oh, that's what all the real fans say! Are\nyou secretly a superhero fanboy?
Oh, the Japanese flavor sounds perfect!\nI'll take one of those, please!
Oh, the Katana Tongue guy? I'm not really into his stuff.
Oh, the door's unlocked...
Oh, the movie's about to start! We should\nhead to our seats.
Oh, the number of bad reviews I had to give them. But of course, I did so with the good of Victory Kitchen in mind.
Oh, the one in Shimokita? So you're a\nhigh schooler.
Oh, then we could belt our hearts out\nto some bangers down in Shibs!
Oh, there is one more thing I must inform\nyou of.
Oh, there it is. Ritsuka's famous,\n"I got it!"
Oh, there you are, {NAME2}.
Oh, there's another post on Divine Justice...
Oh, there's one thing I needed to ask.
Oh, they've got somethin' new. I think I'll\ntry it.
Oh, this guy's name is Mona. How do I explain\nthis? Hmm...
Oh, this is a friend I made recently. {NAME2}!
Oh, this is for me?
Oh, this is just delightful!
Oh, this?
Oh, this? It's nothing. Just a papercut I got handling paperwork at the office.
Oh, this? The guy we have deliver drinks and\nother supplies took the day off.
Oh, those steps were a pain. It took sooo\nmuch practice to make them look good.
Oh, too bad... I wanted you to come explore\nwith us. See you around then!
Oh, uh, nothing important, really.
Oh, uh, sorry. It's just that this ramen is\noutrageously good!
Oh, uh, that's... very generous of you,\nthanks...
Oh, uh... I was really thirsty! I just had to\nhave this juice!
Oh, uhh... I don't know if going with another guy would help...
Oh, um, right. I've got homework and stuff,\nso I should hurry back home!
Oh, um. No, I'm fine... Ah, welcome!
Oh, um...
Oh, um...!
Oh, unrelated, but did you guys hear we're\ngetting a new teacher soon?
Oh, wait! You used to work at Victory Kitchen, right?
Oh, wait, wait! I just need to pick up\nthe delivery.
Oh, wait. By "fragments" do you mean not all of them came back?
Oh, wait. Does this not mean "please"? Um,\nhang on, was there a more polite way to do\nthis?
Oh, wait. That came out weird.
Oh, we have to talk about that! Total misogynist creep, right!?
Oh, we should probably head back! Don't want\nKayo-san to worry again.
Oh, we shouldn't let the noodles get too\nsoft! Let's dig in, {NAME1}-san!
Oh, we're actually Kano-kun's friends!\nWould you mind telling us what happened\nwith him?
Oh, we're both scheduled today! Nice!
Oh, welcome!
Oh, welcome! Please take a seat wherever\nyou like!
Oh, welcome... I mean, hello,\n{NAME2}-kun and Yaoling.
Oh, well, I thought I saw some boxes we\ncould smash through back the way we came...
Oh, what a pity... Our opponent was much\ntoo great...
Oh, what a shame. We've run out of\nfertilizer.
Oh, what am I even talking about? Sorry,\nI know I already said we were finished.
Oh, what is this?
Oh, what's going on here?
Oh, why don't you come? You can eat with\nus too!
Oh, would you like to try?
Oh, would you look at the time.\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san, it's your\ntime to shine.
Oh, wow! I didn't know you could search\nfor it like that!
Oh, wow, a gift?
Oh, wow, look at you. That suits you nicely.
Oh, y-yeah!
Oh, yeah! Just a sec!\nNotebook, notebook...
Oh, yeah! You came by the other day,\ndidn't you?
Oh, yeah. Apparently it keeps track of when\nwe discover new places too.
Oh, yeah. Forgot about you.
Oh, yeah. I promised to make him ramen as\nthanks for saving Wonder.
Oh, yes! And you watch mine!
Oh, yes! We can handle it!
Oh, yes! We should absolutely do that\nwhen we get the chance!
Oh, yes, I agree! Aggressive investment is\nthe only way to get ahead! I was thinking\nthe exact same!
Oh, yes, I agree! The guaranteed principal\nis a surefire success. I was thinking the\nexact same!
Oh, yes, I'm fine. That interaction didn't\nbother me or anything.
Oh, yes, yes there is. I'd like you to\ndigitize some more materials for me.
Oh, yes. It's a riff on the song they'd do\nfor me at bat. Obviously the old version was\na bit diff\u2014
Oh, yes... I received a box of mini cakes\nfrom some relatives recently.
Oh, you cook at your place too, {NAME2}?\nA big kitchen must be nice!
Oh, you decided to come!
Oh, you definitely should then! Here, I'll\ninstall it for you right now!
Oh, you did? Well, there's no need to feel\nbad about taking some down time.
Oh, you don't know, Shun?\nHer father's the president of Umetane.
Oh, you don't look impressed. Not your cup\nof tea I'm guessing?
Oh, you don't? He said this morning that\nhe's open to requests from students...
Oh, you finished yours too? Pretty tasty,\nyeah?
Oh, you know I do! But I have somewhere to be\nafter this. Maybe next time!
Oh, you know I hear Jinbocho's famous for its\ncurry. Let's take a break for a bite!
Oh, you know me so well. No snacks, no life.\nThat's my motto.
Oh, you know what!? We should stop for curry on the way home!
Oh, you look sullen. Do you hate insects?
Oh, you mean "Shaolin Slackers" playing at the\ntheater in Shibuya right now!
Oh, you must be {NAME1}, right?\nMotoha told me about you.
Oh, you there! Do you have anything you\ndon't need anymore?
Oh, you thought I might drop it again?\nI guess I did splash water on you...
Oh, you wanna hit the curry shop today?\nThere's some new stuff I'm itchin' to try!
Oh, you're back! Good to see ya!
Oh, you're back! Impeccable timin'!
Oh, you're being targeted again!
Oh, you're here!
Oh, you're hungry?
Oh, you're interested? Well, if you have\ntime, I'd like to talk face-to-face.
Oh, you're that guy from before!\nUh... {NAME1}-kun!
Oh, you're... {NAME2}? It's nice to\nmeet you. I'm <color=#FF423F>Ann Takamaki</color>.
Oh, you've heard of it, have you? Mastering this move\nmarked the final stage of my training! Hiii-yaaah!
Oh, you. Uh... Been a while.
Oh, you...! You're Shun's friend!
Oh, your shift is already over. See you\nnext time!
Oh, {NAME1}! Perfect timing.
Oh, {NAME1}! This is bad!
Oh, {NAME1}-kun!
Oh, {NAME1}-kun! It means a lot that you\ncame, but I've got to apologize...
Oh, {NAME1}-kun, I've got\na question...
Oh, {NAME1}-kun, perfect timing! We need\nyour help!
Oh, {NAME1}-kun. Do you have a minute?
Oh, {NAME1}-kun...
Oh, {NAME1}-san, I knew I could count on\nyou! Especially today it seems.
Oh, {NAME1}-san. Apologies. I didn't see you\nthere.
Oh, {NAME1}-san. I'd like to speak\nwith you.
Oh, {NAME2}! Could you blow on it\na bit for me? This tongue of mine\nis pretty sensitive.
Oh, {NAME2}! Could you look at this real\nquick?
Oh, {NAME2}! Perfect timing.
Oh, {NAME2}!\nYou came again today!
Oh, {NAME2}, I was just doing a crossword puzzle. Care to join me?
Oh, {NAME2}, just say the word and\nI'll save you a plate too. So long as you\ndon't mind a barebones meal...
Oh, {NAME2}, perfect timing.\nDo you want to play?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan! Are you free?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan! Have a minute? I know I\nshouldn't worry about this, but...
Oh, {NAME2}-chan! You've grown up to be such\na reliable young man.
Oh, {NAME2}-chan.
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. How are you doing?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. How are you?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. I'm glad I ran into\nyou here.
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. I've been seeing a lot of\nyou lately.
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. So, how've you been?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan...
Oh, {NAME2}-kun!
Oh, {NAME2}-kun! All done with classes?
Oh, {NAME2}-kun! That's my buddy\nfor you, always ready to help.
Oh, {NAME2}-kun! Welcome!
Oh, {NAME2}-kun. Good to see you.
Oh, {NAME2}-kun... No, it's\nnothing like that.
Oh, {NAME2}...
Oh, {NAME2}? Where were you?
Oh, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
Oh-ho! You're into this kind of stuff, Mishima?
Oh.
Oh. And Yukimi-san plans on talking things\nout with her mother.
Oh. But I guess there are no pitchers here\nbut the water kind, eh!?
Oh. I can't believe I didn't realize that\ntill now.
Oh. I guess he doesn't hate me at all...
Oh. I see. That's what you mean.
Oh. I... finally get it, I think.
Oh. It's you. Good to see ya again.
Oh. That sucks, but it makes sense. It was\npretty sudden after all.
Oh. True. I didn't really think about it\nbefore, but that's super weird.
Oh. Well, okay then... When you have a\nmoment, I could really use your help.
Oh. You surprised me. I thought you were\nsomeone I know.
Oh. {NAME1}-kun, over there. I think\nthat's her...
Oh...
Oh... Are you worried about me working with\nmy arm?
Oh... I guess we haven't! I'm Skull, nice to\nmeet ya!
Oh... I never would've thought of it like\nthat. So the results determine whether an\naction was right or wrong, huh?
Oh... I see.
Oh... I see. Forgive me.
Oh... Is that right?
Oh... Let's not just stand out here talking,\nlet's go inside.
Oh... Me? Right, yes... I've also been looking forward to the chance to speak with you.
Oh... Nah, that's not happening. Sure that\nband performs at a high level, but...
Oh... No, it's nothing, really.
Oh... Okay! Talk to you next time.
Oh... Sorry. I don't have any more to share\nwith you. But I'll make more, so bear with me\ntill then.
Oh... Thank you...
Oh... That's fine. Maybe next time, yeah?
Oh... That's right. I'm sorry for gettin'\nyou guys in trouble.
Oh... That's too bad. Next time then!
Oh... Then I can teach you myself when\nthere's downtime at work.
Oh... Then I guess I misunderstood. Sorry.
Oh... Uh, I see...
Oh... Uh, about that...
Oh... Well I need my coach there, so lemme\nknow when you're around.
Oh... Well yeah, I guess texting photos\nthese days isn't any different from texting\nmessages.
Oh... Well, I guess you've got stuff going\non. Let me know if you can join us later!
Oh... Well, maybe next time!
Oh... Well, that's all right. Sorry to spring\nthis on you.
Oh... What am I going on about? In any case,\nI just wanted to say, I highly recommend\nhoney.
Oh... You came to see my performance?
Oh... You came, {NAME1}-kun. Sorry, looks like I dozed off.
Oh... right. It's crazy to think that there's\neven more where that came from.
Oh... that's too bad. Thanks anyway. I'll try\nlooking elsewhere.
Oh...! I still have the key to Victory\nKitchen too!
Oh...! T-Thanks... I might need to if it's\nthat spooky.
Oh...! Th-Thank you so much! I've been as\nbusy as a bee lately with celebrations\nand such...
Oh...! That's good...
Oh...|You tried, though!|Did you have fun?
Oh?
Oh? *chuckle* What an uncharacteristic\nresponse.
Oh? Are you free, Sensei?
Oh? Are you not familiar with Menaces?
Oh? Hehe, how poetic.
Oh? I know more about them than you might\nexpect too. There was this anime, you see...
Oh? I'm listening...
Oh? If you need advice, maybe I can help.\nI am an educational consultant after all.
Oh? Is this hers!?
Oh? It's still locked. I could've sworn I\nsensed an invader prowling around.
Oh? Then do tell what your ideal Palace\nwould be like.
Oh? Very well. Then once you've\nprepared, let us head that way.
Oh? Were you two having a conversation?
Oh? What a coincidence, meeting you here!
Oh? What manner of desire is it exactly?\nIs it excitement toward the stars?
Oh? Whatever is the matter?
Oh? You need a ride, too?
Oh? You two are...?
Oh? You're on, then! No way I'll let myself\nlose to you!
Oh? Your expression has shifted. Hoohoo, you\nlook like you're one of the regulars now.
Oh? {NAME1}-sama. You have brought the\nPersona I requested.
Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought\nthe Persona I requested.
Oh?\nBut I thought you were on her side?
Oh?|What are you planning?
Ohhh! Just as I expected! Expertly honed\nmovements... This is exactly what I wanted.
Ohhh! So these are the "monjayaki" I've heard\nso much about!
Ohhh! Then today's my lucky day for sure!
Ohhh, now those're some good-lookin' cr\xeapes.\nYou kids are naturals.
Ohhh, so this store's the original!
Ohhhh, what a relief...
Ohm's law, Charles's law,\neven Coulomb's law...
Oho!
Oho! At this speed, we're practically flying!\nLet's make good use of these.
Oho, I'm sensing a romantic aura... Maybe\nyou should spend time with that special\nsomeone today!
Oi! Hide!
Okaaay, let's cut here.
Okaaay.
Okay kids, don't hassle him too much, okay?
Okay okay, I'm sorry. Don't be mad.
Okay sure, but there's a limit. Didn't that\nthing have a man's voice?
Okay then, let's call it a day for now.
Okay then, we're gonna head out. See you\nall tomorrow!
Okay then, {NAME2}-chan. See you next time\nI need some advice on something!
Okay then. Here goes nothing.
Okay then... I'll just think up names for my\nmoves instead. How's Justice Blast sound?
Okay then.|I'll get supersized everything.|I guess if you're paying...
Okay then.|If that's the case...
Okay!
Okay! But if you guys figure it out, you\ncan't tell him the answer, all right?
Okay! From here on out the Phantom Thieves\nare four members strong. Now let's change\nsome hearts!
Okay! Have some of my rolled omelet! Not to\ntoot my own horn, but it's kinda\nmy specialty.
Okay! I understand.
Okay! I'll appoint you as Moe-chan's special\ncheer captain!
Okay! I'll see you at the square in front of\nShibuya Station then! I'll head right on over\nwhen I'm done.
Okay! I'm coming!
Okay! I've set the trap, just like\nKiuchi-sama ordered.
Okay! Just hold out for a little!
Okay! Let me know if something's not\nworking for you, Fox!
Okay! Let me make you a drink. Consider it\nthanks for the help.
Okay! Let's get a move on! The training\nmachines are callin' our names!
Okay! Let's meet up after getting changed!
Okay! So here's the plan.
Okay! Take care, Mr. Higashino.
Okay! Then let's get going!
Okay! Then let's keep taking down the guards!
Okay! There's this place in <color=#FF423F>Shinjuku</color> I've\nbeen wanting to try. Let's go there.
Okay! Time to prepare you another mocktail as\nthanks for today.
Okay! We won't!
Okay! We're friends now!
Okay! Where do we wanna go then?
Okay, Closer! If we're doing this, there's\nno way I'm losing!
Okay, Coach, here I go!
Okay, I need to check the other stores!
Okay, I think that's enough discussing\nhypothetical situations.
Okay, I think that's just about everything.
Okay, I'll be right there!
Okay, I'm almost done with the song! All\nthat's left are the finishing touches!
Okay, I'm in favor as well. That means we've\nreached a consensus. We will change\nMiyazawa's heart.
Okay, Ms. Katayama. With me, please.
Okay, Shun-kun. Let me explain to you how\nFood Fight works.
Okay, a quick recap before we really get\ninto higher-order equations.
Okay, and this collective unconscious sound... Can you still make it out from here?
Okay, but I want to play soon!
Okay, class. Today we'll go over the author\nof "Mido Kampakuki."
Okay, contract signed.
Okay, done! "15 km today! Ran like the wind\nin Shimokita!"
Okay, drink break's over. Time to start\nwalking again.
Okay, everyone. That's all for today. Pass your career questionnaires to the front.
Okay, fine.|Well, when you put it that way...
Okay, finished writing my <color=#FF423F>diary</color> entry, now\nI'd better get back to practice!
Okay, firearms... Where are the firearms...?
Okay, friend! Let's plan a walking date\ncourse together that will really work\nher muscles!
Okay, give me the most intense pose\nyou've got.
Okay, goodbye.
Okay, got it.
Okay, got it. I'll keep the ingredients in\nstock so I can make it whenever.
Okay, got it. Thanks! Talk to you later!
Okay, here I go!
Okay, here comes the boiled egg. Open wide!
Okay, here goes nothing!
Okay, here we go. Great pose, by the way,\n{NAME1}-chan.
Okay, hold on a sec then. I'll have it ready\nin no time.
Okay, homeroom's over, everyone.
Okay, how about we play something together\nnext time? You can bring your bass.
Okay, how about you play something for me to\nstart off with? That way, I can come up with\na suitable practice routine for you!
Okay, later!
Okay, lead the way.|Could you repeat that?
Okay, let's do this! Get fired up!
Okay, let's get back to those weird statues!
Okay, let's get started!
Okay, let's get this beef bowl bonanza\nstarted! Fight on!
Okay, let's get this train a rollin'! It's\na bit of a hike, but I promise it'll be\nworth it!
Okay, let's go to the next location.
Okay, let's go.
Okay, let's head home for now and meet back up at Heritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya tonight!
Okay, let's head out on the route we\nagreed on.
Okay, let's head over there next.
Okay, let's head to the palace.|I'll think about it.
Okay, let's head to the supermarket. But you\nonly get to pick one snack each, got it?
Okay, let's review our objective.
Okay, let's say you manage to win the Food Fight. How do we know Miyazawa won't just...
Okay, let's split the remaining members into two even teams.
Okay, let's try outside the gates, then!
Okay, let's try this again...
Okay, listen, it's not that I like him or\nanything! I'm just a little curious is all.
Okay, looks like it worked out! The Core's\nall ours!
Okay, no need to hold back. You're gonna\nhelp me out too, you know.
Okay, no worries. Sorry to keep you.
Okay, now let me give this a sip!
Okay, now that we've figured out our vision,\nlet's put it all together!
Okay, okay. Extra-large for everyone. I'll\neven throw in some gyoza too.
Okay, okay. I came up with a combo for when\nyou're starvin', so I'll whip a bowl up for\nyou later.
Okay, onto our next topic: the travels of\nthe adventurer Marco Polo.
Okay, out with it. I need details!
Okay, pull out before their\nbackup gets here.
Okay, see you around.
Okay, see you later!
Okay, see you!
Okay, since I saw you first, try answering\nthis, {PLAYER_NAME}.
Okay, so be sure to remember this theorem...
Okay, so it seems like Tomoko's life isn't in danger or anything like that.
Okay, so the band club is looking for an\nextra member.
Okay, so we go straight down here...\nthen take a left... and it should be\naround there. Follow me!
Okay, so we need tomatoes and green onions,\nand also some ginger and radishes...
Okay, sure! I'll try that.
Okay, sure.
Okay, sure.|If I must.
Okay, sure.|If you must.
Okay, talk to you later. Be sure to brush\nyour teeth before bed, okay?
Okay, that settles it! I'll go look for\nplanters, seedlings, and a kitchen!
Okay, that was "The Life of an\nAmorous Man."
Okay, that was almost too smooth. Are you\nsure you're younger than me?
Okay, that's a plan! Let me know when you\nwant to go looking!
Okay, that's a wrap!
Okay, that's all of my questions! You did\na great job!
Okay, that's it for homeroom today.
Okay, that's that then!
Okay, that's the last one!
Okay, the enemy's focus is on\nhim. Looks like the rest of\nus can slip away.
Okay, then here goes!
Okay, then let's go to <color=#FF423F>Boom Bang Burger\nin Shibuya</color>! There's a limited-time menu I've\nbeen dying to try.
Okay, then! Time to try and expand my\nculinary repertoire!
Okay, then. Team Weird Critters will be\nsearching for the Core with me.
Okay, then... No problem.
Okay, this one!
Okay, time for a challenge from me, too!\nI'm feeling like {PLAYER_NAME}-kun\nhas this one in the bag!
Okay, today let's do some applied calculus.
Okay, we have a deal! Let's work together\nto achieve both our goals!
Okay, we'll meet tomorrow morning on the platform for the Inogami Line!
Okay, we'll wait here then. Give us a shout\nwhen you're ready!
Okay, we're counting on you.|We'll buy you some time!
Okay, what kind of "seal" opens just by\npointing a camera at it?
Okay, what should I make next? Maybe\nsomething minty?
Okay, workbench secured. Now let's head to your house and await its arrival.
Okay, you have 30 minutes to complete the\nExtra Large-sized Challenge!
Okay, you have 30 minutes to complete the\nLarge-sized Challenge!
Okay, you have 30 minutes to complete the\nUniverse-sized Challenge!
Okay, you kids're on cr\xeape duty. Wrapping's\na cinch, and cooking's not too hard either\nonce you're used to it.
Okay, you two. That's enough.
Okay, you two. That's enough. This whole\nworld could collapse at any moment, so\nthere really isn't time to waste.
Okay, you're on register again today.
Okay, you're on register today.
Okay, {NAME1}-kun. Pop quiz for you\nto get everyone's brains going again.
Okay, {NAME2}! Where to next?
Okay, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nHelp me out with this mess.
Okay.
Okay. I'm sure this'll go off without a hitch\nif you're there with me, {NAME1}-kun.
Okay. I'm sure this'll go off without a hitch\nif you're there with me, {NAME2}-kun.
Okay. I'm sure you know what you're talking about since you worked there.
Okay. In that case...
Okay. It seems like his breathing is mostly back to normal. I'm sure he'll be okay...
Okay. Now, just have a seat right there.
Okay. Shun's good to go too.
Okay. Then, I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. We've decided on our topic, so let's\nbegin the interviews.
Okay. Well, just lemme know if you need\na hand.
Okay...
Okay... Anything for you, Panther.
Okay... Here I go...
Okay... How about we try it once with the\nvolume down?
Okay... I think I'm ready now. I'm doing\nthis.
Okay... I understand.\nSorry to have caused such trouble.
Okay... Miyazawa has most certainly seen the\ncalling card. With this, the Treasure should\nhave manifested in the Metaverse.
Okay... Please, do what you can,\n{NAME2}-chan.
Okay... So you have plenty of time on your\nhands, huh?
Okay... Well, he'd always lambaste other\ndancers before he got obsessed with me.
Okay... What's something that sounds mysterious...?
Okay.|Looking forward to the pay.
Okay.|Not now.
Okey-doke! I'll head over there first!
Okey-doke. I'll let Kotone-san know that\nwe'll reschedule.
Okey-dokey then. Let's have that talk next\ntime you're free.
Okie doke, I'll get this shipped to the address you gave. Come again!
Okie!
On behalf of his friend as well, I hope\nyou'll continue helping with his requests.
On one hand, it could prevent future harm by\npublicizing information about Menaces...
On our way home from work actually.
On second thought...
On that note, I have a proposition.
On that note, everyone calls each other by\ncode names here, like "Closer" and\n"Soy," right?
On that wall.|It's spinning.
On the other hand, black is fermented over\nmany years and has a strong taste and aroma.
On the other hand, it could also be used\nto harass or even dox people over\npetty grievances.
On the other hand, milk helps you fill up\non calcium and other essential vitamins.
On the other hand, when you pick up a book\nyou know nothing about, it might not go well.
On top of that, the event's gonna bleed the\nfans dry. Messed up, right?
On-site?|What do you mean?
Once I chose Japan, Papa got serious about\nmaking sure I study hard and learn a lot. But\nthe thing is...
Once I even went to a match of his in\nShibuya! For that one I think I took... Was it\nthe Inogami Line to Shimo-Kitazawa?
Once I needed to find a job, I started\nwondering if I could make drinks like that.
Once I settle the score with her, you can all go. Well, after you've undergone some intense training.
Once I win those, I'll face Tamayo again, and\nplay catch with Tomoko too...
Once I'm done with everything.|Could you wait a bit?
Once I've made 'em, you can take 'em to\nthe customers.
Once Victory Kitchen's yours, we can finally go ahead and establish a chain!
Once a place gets enough buzz around it,\nit becomes too crowded. You have to keep up!
Once he gets them on tape, it becomes\nimpossible for them to escape accusation.
Once it's delivered and the target\nrecognizes their Treasure is under threat of\nbeing stolen, it will materialize.
Once it's ready, you'll be my first\ncontestant, {NAME2}!
Once she picked up the tricks, she got\nreally fast...
Once the fruits start to grow, we'll cover\nthem up together!
Once these two are dealt with,
Once this all blows over, come back for a\nbite, okay? Later!
Once we do, the Treasure will appear in the Metaverse.
Once we take that Treasure from behind you, we'll be on our way.
Once we're done buying flowers, why don't we\ntake a look around the shops here?
Once we're done soaking in the view, where\nwould you recommend we go next, Sensei?
Once you have enough points, issue\nyour command.
Once you have learned to understand the\norange tabby, you may ask him directly.
Once you said it was linked to his desires, I immediately saw the connection.

One moment, Wonder. Let's take a look\nat the device over there first.
One more time! Huh?
One must always pursue the truth that lies\nahead, not ingratiate oneself to one's peers.

One wrong move and she could be permanently\ninjured... She may even lose her life!
One!
One, two, three, one, and...!

Onto other news...
Oof, looks like today's gonna be another\nbusy day...
Oof, my stomach... I ate way too much...\nWhere's the antacids?
Oof, that's so real!
Oof. RIP...
Oof... No luck today either. It's always\nlike this... Horse racing is a reflection of\nmy life, after all.
Oof... So, you're not sure I can win? Don't\nworry! Watch me bring the fury!
Ooh!
Ooh! I heard about all the bookstores here,\nbut the stories don't do it justice!
Ooh! I know!
Ooh! I'll be counting on you, then!
Ooh! Nice! So we can give him the calling card then.
Ooh, Chief Strategist? That sounds so cool!\nWe're startin' to seem pretty legit, huh?
Ooh, I came here with my hubby\nwhen I was younger!
Ooh, I know what's popular these days.\nPopcorn, right?
Ooh, I know! Let's bring this topic a bit\ncloser to home. {PLAYER_NAME}-san,\nyou take this one.
Ooh, I want one!|Could I see it?
Ooh, I'm sensing...\nMewhehehee, the core's close, for sure!
Ooh, are we talking about soda?
Ooh, do you think Magatsukami knows about it\nyet? We should post about it!

Ooh, nice and hearty. And it even tastes\ngood cold.
Ooh, nice energy! I like it.
Ooh, nice!
Ooh, nice! I'd love to see you play sometime.

Ooh, now I gotta find out!
Ooh, ooh! They told me their school is really\nbig! So big you can picnic in the yard!
Ooh, ooh, did you hear!? Someone from the\nnext classroom over told me about this.
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Can I see it, too!?
Ooh, really!?
Ooh, so you mean the rivers around here\naren't just for show?
Ooh, sorry. The right answer is any kind\nof triangle.
Ooh, unfortunately not. It's best to use\nthe median here.
Ooh, we got one in already!
Ooh, what kind of puzzles though? I wonder\nwhat Shota-kun would like best!
Ooh, where? I wanna see!
Ooh, yeah! You should come too!
Ooh, you landed a rare one! That's double\npoints, so %d for this one.

Oops, got a little carried away there.\nSorry 'bout that.
Oops, sorry... I forgot that talking directly\nto a woman's muscles can scare her off.
Open the door.
Open the door.|Maybe we shouldn't.
Open the door|Come back later
Open the gate!
Opening up this new area of Mementos likely had some impact there as well.
Operation X?|Launch?
Or "that's a dangerous threat." It's like\nsaying "my headache hurts!"
Or I guess, it really was like the Shadow\nreminded me of a different person entirely.
Or I'll take a video of this and throw you\nunder the bus too! Gahaha!
Or are they just something somebody told you\nwas proper?
Or did they prioritize convenience over\nflavor?
Or do I have to teach you a lesson like I did to that pigtailed brat!?
Or how this place is similar yet so different\nfrom a Palace we already know...
Or if you could make something,\nthat would be good. For free at the moment.\nBut I'll repay you... someday!
Or it may be the source that brings\ndestruction forth.
Or like the first time you talked to me.\nThose kinds of memories.
Or maybe "planner" would be more accurate.\nFeel free to be proactive in throwing\nout ideas.
Or maybe even a baseball stadium!?\nNah, that's a stretch...
Or maybe it's just me? I may have grown\nolder, but I still feel just as young at\nheart...
Or maybe it's not so unexpected...\nWho knows? Hehe.
Or maybe that's a little too cynical...\nLet's just say it depends on the person.
Or maybe... she's being exploited?
Or perhaps you could say "exquisite."
Or rather, I never appreciated how happy your\nconcern made me until now.
Or really, because of who I am now.
Or should I say... the younger sister of\nthe lovely prosecutor, Sae Niijima.
Or so claims a certain book. Yet, now that we\nare inside, it appears to be devoid of such\ncharacteristics.
Or so you'd think!
Or something along those lines anyway.
Or something like that...?
Or they might step in to take a blow for you,\nlike Take-kun did. Both are true signs of\nfriendship.
Or we can go back.|Why not turn around?
Or, if you want, I've got a card case you\ncould take too... Which one do you like more?
Or, so I thought... It turns out that\nlistening just isn't enough!
Or, what kind would you most like to eat\nright now? Just curious about your tastes!
Or...
Or... Are you saying what I think you're\nsaying?
Or... they're just unwilling to make a move.
Oracle was with me just a moment ago, but\nshe left to go check on something.
Orange!
Order and discipline come before anything\nelse. Take my mask, and let us defend our\nhonor together.
Order up!
Order whatever you like.|It's your cheat day.
Ordering omelette rice from one's "fave" is\nthe most basic of basic rules of conduct.
Other Phantom Thieves.|Other Persona-users.
Other farmers, huh?
Other intruders? I knew it. They must have\nbeen the ones to unlock the gate.
Other ones? Okay, I have no idea who\nyou're talking about...
Other students may have been recording too.\nIt did cause quite a stir.
Others can't go and tell you to start wanting\nthings. That's not how desire works...
Otherwise you can look up tutorials online,\n'kay? Knock yourselves out.
Our allies have become Forgetful! Quickly,\nhave <color=#FF423F>Marian</color> use her <color=#FF423F>Healing Grace</color>\nto help them!
Our apologies, but we're fully booked right now.
Our bones come in at around four or five\non the scale, making them about as tough\nas iron or glass.
Our club did all kinds of dances. This one\nwas a belly dancing competition.
Our club does revolve around having fun\nand relaxing.
Our club motto is "have fun\nand take it easy," after all.
Our contract has deepened my understanding of\nyou tenfold.
Our contract is proceeding smoothly,\nbut there is something I would like to\nconfirm with you.
Our contract is proving fruitful.\nI understand you more deeply than before.

Our doors are always open. Please do get in\ntouch if you'd like to give it another try.
Our eyes have met, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nWhat was Ghino di Tacco's nickname?
Our field is rather large, so I went to buy\nus this big hose!
Our goal is to observe and grasp what exactly\nan idol is.
Our investigation comes first and foremost.\nNow, let's gather information from the young\nvisitors.
Our last ball's probably in there! C'mon,\nlet's go get it!
Our match is just around the corner!
Our minds are now enriched, as are\nour pockets.
Our next objective is to secure a route\nto Akashi's Treasure, but...
Our only option is to return to the real\nworld and find a way to unlock the plant\nfrom there.
Our opponent will be Nanjo Academy!
Our path's been blocked, has it? We'll need\nto head over there for now to disarm\nthe traps.
Our paths shall soon cross again.
Our relationship...?
Our route may not be the most steady going forward.
Our shift's just about over! Let's do our\nbest by these blooms until then!
Our shop is right over there, just wait for\nme by the entrance!
Our shop is right over there. Could you come\nalong? It'd be great if you could\nwatch the kids.
Our shop's been crazy busy. I'm thankful,\nof course, but that means it gets\ncrazy hectic!
Our strength is needed! Russet, let's give\nvolunteering our all.
Our tare recipe's been adapted over\ngenerations. And our salt skewers are just\nas good!

Our team won!
Our teamwork is going to blow everyone out of the water!
Our teeth.|Our eyelashes.|Our pinky toes.
Our what now?|You plan to move in here?
Ouroboros?
Out for a run?|She's pretty fast...
Outside the legal system, people tend to\nuse "MO" casually to refer to their habits\nand guilty pleasures.
Outside your area?|Overthinking?
Outta nowhere, my dad poured curry into my\nramen.
Over here looks like the way up to the\nsecond floor!
Over here!
Over here, Tanemura-senpai! Over here!
Over here, you have that first-time login\nbonus given to every new player!
Over here.
Over there!
Over there! That's certainly the place. The shop is smaller than I imagined.
Over time I started to gain popularity... But\nas I discovered different restaurants, I\nfound myself getting so irritated...
Overcome your fears!|...Are we trading or not?
Overcoming the enemy's strength may have\nbeen a crucial step in our journey.
Overflowing power has joined you...
Ow!
Ow... I've got a headache, all right.
Oww!

P-Please, {NAME1}-san. The fate of our\nmission depends on it. Really.
P-Please... For the kitties...
Pa, payappa...?|Payappa!
Painfully so...
Painting equipment for me. Not just\ncanvases, but new palettes and painting\nknives, too.
Palace detected.
Palace libraries usually have some kind of\nsecret hiding inside them.
Palace rulers revel in their own twisted desires, so they're considered deviant by the public.
Palace?|What's that?
Panther's right. I'm worried about the rest\nof our friends, too.
Panther, got a minute?
Panther...
Papa never really explained his thought\nprocess, so it's hard to say...
Pardon me! More water to keep our fine\ncustomers hydrated!
Pardon me, where is Naruru? I believe her\nshift is today.
Pardon me.
Pardon me. I have a few questions.
Pardon me. I'd like to ask for directions...
Pardon me. It seems I got a little too\nexcited.
Pardon the interruption.
Part of being a leader is making appropriate\ndecisions for the group.
Part of the judging involves me making and\nsubmitting an original cocktail...
Part-time job?|What kind of job?|Work is for chumps.
Pay close attention to where the barcodes are\nas you scan each item.
Pay close attention. Enemies will appear at\nthe edges of the screen.
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
Paying attention to details like that isn't\nbad. But it sounds a bit snobby when you\npoint it out.
Peace and security are my duties...\nI shall be your mask and grant you my power!
Peculiar?|What kind of Shadow is it?
People SHOULD talk about their dreams!
People all around the world are waiting\npatiently for you to grace the rink again!
People are only kind to me because I'm the\nheir to Umetane.

People have taken to calling him the "Subway Slammer."
People like to yap about it online, but that\njust ends up as free publicity\nfor the Menaces.
People may think it sounds good to live\nfree from desire, but that can hardly be\ncalled "living."
People often talk about the millennia of\nhistory behind Chinese cuisine.
People often think that literature is\nimpossible to understand, but Kenko's\nwords are still applicable even today!
People probably come here\nto enjoy music and have\na few drinks...
People sacrifice themselves for the desires\nthey believe in, not knowing what awaits\nthem.
People say we only consult them\nduring experiments...
People turned to the black market to survive.\nAll right, {PLAYER_NAME}!
People use mnemonics to remember this stuff,\nbut rote memorization's so boring, if you\nask me.
People use them without understanding what\nthey indicate all the time, too.
People who write that stuff write way too much... Like that Katana Tongue Miyazawa guy.
People who wrote some of the more extreme\ncomments were even convicted in criminal\ncourt.
Perfect for going out. I'm glad we got to\nmeet up on a day like this.
Perfect numbers were even thought to be mystical...
Perfect numbers... Hoom, is 6 not one\nas well? 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6, no?
Perfect timin'. Today is nuts.
Perfect timing! I actually have a\nfavor to ask you...
Perfect timing! I was just about to send you\na message.
Perfect timing, {NAME2}! I was hoping\nI'd bump into you!
Perfect timing. I was thinkin' of meetin'\nwith Serizawa-san to talk about the\ncompetition...
Perfect timing. Leo-chan and I were just\nabout to go shopping together.
Perfect timing. Let's test the power we just acquired on that Shadow over there.
Perfect timing. There is something I wish\nto discuss with you.
Perfect weather for running today!
Perfect! As in perfect numbers.

Perfect, I've got plenty of things to say\nabout that myself.
Perfect, all the grates are open now!

Perfect.|Will that be enough?|Insects, huh...

Perhaps there has been a mix-up. Something\ncertainly feels amiss.
Perhaps there is something befitting of my\ngallant and robust nature?
Perhaps there's a <color=#FF423F>key</color> somewhere? Let's search\nfor one, Wonder.
Perhaps they're searching for\nthat popular item the\nmanager mentioned...
Perhaps this affection you show them\nmeans your <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> has increased?

Perhaps your valiant dishwashing efforts\nwill be of aid to Yamagoshi, hm?
Perhaps. But it looks like you've figured\nit out...

Persona... So that's what they're called.
Persona...\nMementos... Shadows...?

Personally, fighting's welcome under my roof.

Perspective is key to solving a puzzle\nor quiz.
Pests? That must be it!
Pet!?
Pfff, whaaaat? Nooo...
Pfff, yeah sure. Like anything will actually\nchange anyway.
Phantom Idol.|That's not it.
Phantom Thieves must operate in secret.\nI take it you're in the same line of work?
Phantom thieves must always act with purpose.\nYou understand,{NAME2}?
Phantom... Thieves...

Physical fitness is essential, even for\nPhantom Thieves.
Physical training, you say? A fine idea.
Physically abusing my team...
Pick up your stamp cards over there.

Pickling it myself seems like a hassle, but\nit's all about the experience, right?
Piggyback!? Um, no. Veto! If anyone's going\nto do it, it'll be me!
Pineapple, strawberry, green apple...\nThey all sound delicious.
Pink carnations represent gratitude. An apt\nflower for any celebration.
Pitching, batting, an all-rounder... That's\nwho you were in little league!
Places like the EU have proposed eliminating\nsmall denomination coins to avoid these\ncosts.
Places like this are great for eavesdropping\non other customers.
Places such as this may contain dormant\ndesires that cannot be attained in the\nreal world.
Plainly put I... p-plagiarized work...!

Pleasure to meet you.|I think we've met.|Yaoling here is my disciple.
Pleeeaaase!
Plenty of other kids did the same, too.
Plenty of standard drink\nofferings here.
Plum juice.|Plum rice.
Plus he disappeared into thin air while on the train yesterday! Something seems off about him...
Plus if I had lost to Kiuchi, even more\npeople's desires would've been stolen\nfrom them.
Plus it's gonna taste like curry, so I'm sure\nit won't disappoint. Let's dig in.
Plus the charms on my cell are falling off!\nLike, OMG, WTF!
Plus, I don't think I've played at someone\nelse's place since high school band practice.
Plus, a lot of places are short-staffed right\nnow and looking for help.
Plus, different flowers bloom there every\nseason. I'm not sure what's out now...
Plus, going to a solo-exhibit seems kinda classy.
Plus, his class is surprisingly fun. He tells\nreally cool stories and stuff all the time.
Plus, it kind of sounds like it could be a\nname anyway.
Plus, it's not a bad deal for you, {NAME2},\nright?
Plus, so many others who supported me and\nhelped me get to where I am right now,\nsinging my own songs.
Plus, there's this super messed up event\nhappening soon.
Plus, we don't have bench players. Without me, we can't play in the scrimmage.
Plus, we're doin' this for a change of pace,\nright? Scuse me, two servings of fried rice,\nplease.
Plus, you get your tongue dyed a fun color\nwhen you're done, haha!
Plus, you're with me.
Plus...
Poor Shun saw us unable to act, and stood up to him in our place.
Poor Yamagoshi-san... Caring about a problem\nchild like you literally stopped his heart.\nHeheh... Gahahaha!
Poor Yukimi-san... You think she's okay?
Pops always used to say that you can tell\na lot about someone by their kitchen.
Pops and I are cookin' up each of our\nspecial ramens, so get ready to eat at least\ntwo bowls!
Pops had a heart attack... They said\nhe's dead...
Pops seems to be feelin' a lot better. He's\nin the kitchen about once a week now.
Pops would always say, "Wait until\nhigh school!"
Pops!
Pops, Shige-san, thanks a ton for today.\nHey... {NAME2}, I think I get it now.
Pops...
Pose?|H-How's this?|Way ahead of you!

Power over capacity? Then why couldn't we\nget the door open?
Powers of observation...|Powers of transformation...
Practice resumes...
Practice?
Practice?|You've known each other that long?
Preamble aside, I must relay another warning.
Precious item?|Steal?
Precisely how much time is required before\nwe may hold hands? One day? Two?
Precisely, Closer.
Precisely.
Precisely. Although...
Precisely. As he just said, there are seven\ntreasures hidden in Shinjuku.
Precisely. Hoohoo, I see. That explains how you could hear my voice.
Precisely. It's time I ought to explain our\ngoal, and the Treasure, in more detail.
Precisely. Therefore it's the kind of risky\nmove I prefer to avoid where possible.
Precisely. Tuning into the sound of the collective unconscious allowed me to sniff it out.
Precisely. We can't risk that person\ndiscovering our true identities.
Precisely. What is considered one "li" depends on where and when you are in history.
Precisely. Why not test it to discern what\npower it holds?
Precisely. You are quite the sharp one. Now,\nto continue...
Precisely. You are truly quite astute...
Precisely. You're pretty quick on the uptake, Closer.
Prejudgments and one-sided beliefs will only\nend up warping into evil desires.
Prepare to be executed!

Press the button|Take more time to prepare
Pressing this switch should allow us to go\ndown to the basement.
Pretty big... and full of Shadows, too.\nCareful, everyone.
Pretty crazy, right? I guess they just like\nliving on the wild side...
Pretty fun, right!? Science is a human\ncreation, but it's stuff like that that makes\nit feel even more human.
Pretty much! You've got a good head on\nyour shoulders, er.... Miss Yellow!
Pretty sure he was a goner\nthe second he lost it...
Pretty weird, huh? Maybe it's some\nkinda distortion in space and time?
Probably country of origin?|Just gotta memorize 'em.
Probably, yeah. Which would mean that\n"Castle Miyazawa" is...
Proceed with caution, {NAME1}-san.
Produce stores, restaurants... Ooh! And is\nthat a Japanese confectionery I see!?
Promise me that!
Promise!
Promise?|You mean the concept caf\xe9?
Promotion...?
Proof...?
Proper etiquette dictates the customer\nstrive...
Protecting his allies was his greatest source\nof pride... You can understand just how much\n<sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> he possessed.
Protein Lovers is open 24 hours a day!\nSign up now for a new member discount!

Protein...? S-Sure, that sounds good.\nOh, I have to get back to work now, but I'll\nbe in touch.
Providing this service required a great\ndeal of research on my part.
Pssst... Wonder. What's pun ash?
Psst, hey, {NAME1}-kun.
Publishing my name and picture like that's no laughing matter.
Pulling his strings?
Punishing corrupt adults and helping those in need...
Pushing the box around won't do anything.\nLet's look around the room some more.
Pushing yourself that hard takes some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\n, I'll give you that.
Put an end to all this...
Put this in too. Noodles are good and all,\nbut with curry you gotta have rice as well.
Put up some decorations, play some music,\nand this place will start to feel quite\nluxurious...
Put yourself in my shoes! Wh-What if you\nlost your student ID, huh!?
Putting all that work into the garden\nsurely teaches you greater <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>.
Putting balls into the holes unlocked a door,\nallowing us to proceed.
Putting her methods aside, I\ncould sense Merope was being\nthoughtful... in her own way.
Queen taught Closer and I\nhow to memorize\nmath formulas...
Queen! Good to see you're safe too!
Queen's lessons are so easy to understand!\nEven I can remember everything...
Question three! This time, we're looking at\nthe Station Square!
Question two! This time we're headed over\nto Central Street!
Quick, find the intruders!
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet, girls!
Quiet, please...
Quiet.
Quit bein' all weird and pointin' it out like\nthat, man, haha.
Quit screwing with us, dammit!
Quite a bother... Let's settle this quickly,\nWonder!
Quite a brutal strategy.,. But not a bad\nidea. Let's aim for the eyes!
Quite an archetypal fairy-tale image.\nJust reading about it paints a vivid picture.
Quite the difference, right? The distance\nalso changes depending on whether or not\nyou include the mountains and valleys.
Quite. One doesn't just stumble upon such\nhidden treasures so conveniently...
Quite. We expected to get drenched,\nbut had a comfortable little journey instead.
Quitting something she loved that much must've been really hard on her.
Quitting... Giving up the Phantom Thieves...
R-Ready, set, go!?
R-Really!? You think so? You're making me\nblush...
R-Really?
R-Really? Do you actually come here often,\nthen?
R-Really? Haha, thanks... I am pretty\nproud of it.
R-Really? Hehe! All that practice to keep\nmyself looking composed paid off!
R-Really? If you know a place that would\nwork, I won't say no...
R-Really? Well, if you insist, {NAME1}-san.
R-Right! Wow, you respect me as your mocktail\ninstructor that much, huh?
R-Right!? That would never happen!
R-Right, yeah! Thanks!
R-Right. I'd be happy to! I'll find us a spot\nwith a protein-rich menu!
R-Right...
R-Right... Even a simple walk... can be good\nfor your health.
R-Right... Um, sorry.
R-Riko-senpai!?
Raaagh!
Rain in a drought?|You're welcome, I think...?
Rain, huh...
Raise the alarm! Trespassers must not be\nallowed inside this castle!
Ramen Promenade is a big ramen event\nfeaturin' famous ramen shops from all over.
Ramen and gyoza, please!
Ramen that has the potential to become a new\nstandard.
Ramen that'll be loved by everyone, huh...?\nSo more traditional ramen then?
Ramen with character... What would my unique\nspin on it would be...?
Ramen's a pretty handy pick when you wanna\neat out, but you can't exactly eat it on the\ngo, can you?
Ramen. Well, I've had to quit my part-time\ngig for reasons I won't get into, but...
Random question. Ain't it hard to juggle\nmultiple Personas?
Rata... what?
Ratatouille certainly contains a lot of\nvegetables... But isn't it mainly bell\npeppers and onions?
Rather than a lengthy explanation, I think\na demonstration would be sufficient. Wonder,\ntry using it now.
Rather, he solves problems by force so that\nhe alone is in a position to succeed.
Reading this book should help you appreciate\nmovies more in the future.
Ready to go in?
Ready to go?
Ready to hit the books again, {NAME2}? Also,\nwanna hang out when we're done?

Really!? We'd better go save her\nright away, then!
Really!? Wooho\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nthat's what I thought you'd say.
Really!? Y-You think so? Th-Then maybe\nI'll go with that...
Really!? Yaaa\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nI expected as much.

Really, you have!? Are all high school\nstudents rich these days?
Really, you two? Flattery's not gonna get you\nanywhere with me, okay?
Really, {NAME1}-kun, thanks so much for\ntoday. Let me know next time you're free,\nokay?
Really. Curses! They just loved that stuff\nback in the Heian period. It was just\nghosts this, spirits that!
Really...
Really... Okay, I'll have to apologize when\nwe get back to school.
Really... So Tomoko will\u2014!
Really...? How did I get so turned around?
Really...? Thank you for... putting in\nso much effort...
Really?
Really? Again!? Stop stealing my lines out\nfrom under me!

Really? For free?
Really? Great!
Really? Great! I'll make it quick then. Well,\nquick by my standards.
Really? Great! I'll make it quick then.\nI think it really will be short this time.
Really? Great! I'll make this quick.
Really? Great! I'll make this short.
Really? Great! Okay, I'll make this short.
Really? Great! Okay, I'll make this short.\nShort for me at least.
Really? Great! This job's at a convenience\nstore in Shibuya.
Really? Hah, good to hear!
Really? Hehe!
Really? Huh... That's kind of a relief.
Really? I don't think so.
Really? I guess you see things more like\nI do.
Really? I had no idea. I always sleep, but\nmaybe I'll try listening for a change.
Really? I hope you're right...
Really? I'd love to see you in action!
Really? I'm so happy to hear that!
Really? In that case...
Really? It does sound kind of relaxing. Maybe\nI should try it out myself...
Really? Just for the coat?|That's so you.
Really? Like, for sure? I mean, I'm a good\nbit older than you.
Really? Not what I expected. You really got\nme thinking, though...
Really? Oh, that's wonderful to hear!
Really? Okay, then let's go! This time we're\nworking at a flower shop!
Really? She'll be okay, right!?
Really? Thank god!
Really? Thank you!
Really? Thanks...!
Really? That's great! Thank you!
Really? That's great! This is a little too\nmuch for me to figure out alone.
Really? That's okay? Thank you so much! I was\nkinda nervous, but I'm glad I asked!
Really? That's too bad. Maybe when you have\nsome time, okay?
Really? Then please, I need to ask you about\nsomething!
Really? Then...
Really? Well, I'm sure you've got what it takes. You'll pick it up in no time, I promise.
Really? Well, let me know when you have a\nmoment to spare, okay?
Really? Well, let me know when you have a\nmoment, okay?
Really? Well, let me know when you have a\nspare moment, okay?
Really? Well, let me know when you have the\ntime, okay?
Really? Well, let me know when you have time\nto spare, okay?
Really? Well, let me know when you have\ntime, okay?
Really? Well, my current recommendation would\nbe that caf\xe9 in Zoshigaya.
Really? What a little rascal. Well, he's\nliving his best kitty life.
Really? What kind of work is he...
Really? What kind?
Really? Yay!
Really? You mean it!? Yaaay! That's great!
Really? You really think so?
Really? You think so!? Oh wow... Maybe I'll\nbuy these on the way out.
Really? You will!? Thank you so much! Okay,\nI'll be ready in two seconds!
Really? You've got weird taste, man.\nI'll say that much.
Really?|I don't get it.
Reasons... Like wanting me to experience life\noverseas somewhere? Japan or otherwise.
Recently we've had a bad losing streak against them, and everyone's feeling pretty bitter about it.
Recently, I've been feeling an aura of\n"change" all over Shinjuku...
Reclaim that desire called Love!
Recover all seven Treasures?|Take on another six Palaces?
Red bean bun.|Miso-flavored peanuts.
Red roses are the embodiment of love\nand boldness.
Red roses.|Sweet osmanthus.|Gold gerbera.
Red's not really my favorite ranger color,\nactually.
Red's usually the main hero, sure, but\nI think support roles like Blue are\nreally cool.
Regarding Mr. Akashi from the assembly\nthis morning...
Regarding your efforts to strengthen\nyour desire, please be aware my master values\nthe achievements you have made thus far.
Regardless of whether he was an idol or not,\nthey understood why I wanted to take\nhis photo...
Regardless of whether his critiques are valid\nor fabricated, his viewers lap up every word.\nEventually, customers stop coming.
Regardless of whether or not his sacrifice\nwas meaningful, you could really sense his\n<sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>, couldn't you?
Regardless of whether you meet or not, that\nplot of land is what keeps you connected in\nmore ways than you think.
Regardless, you look proud. Such bedlam\nbegets equal rewards.
Regardless, you must remain focused and\navoid making mistakes.
Regardless, you put in a valiant effort\nagainst that enormous ramen bowl.
Regular frankfurters are good, but the\ngrilled ones are the best. They're\nhooting sublime!
Reinforcements are on their way!
Reinforcements!?
Reinforcements, huh... If the battle drags on, it won't be in our favor. Time for a secret weapon.
Relationships are about give and take, right?\nI can't be the only one benefiting!
Relieving fatigue, huh... Then they might\ncome in handy for our phantom thief\nlifestyle.
Remarkable dexterity, Wonder.
Remember how I said I'm really bad with away\ngames?
Remember how I told you a lot of our players lost interest and quit all of a sudden?
Remember in elementary school when there was that one player I really looked up to? Kinda like that?
Remember that flyer I showed you? About the\nbartender competition?
Remember that unsolvable puzzle from\nthe diner? It made me think of something...
Remember that, and you'll have everything\nscanned in no time!
Remember the question from the puzzle\nchallenge that was wrong?
Remember what I said when we were up here\nbefore? About wishing Miyazawa would admit\nto his wrongdoing.
Remember what I told you about Leo-chan\nbefore?
Remember what I told you about enemy\nweaknesses? These Shadows are weak\nto guns. Use that to knock them down.
Remember what I told you about the\nmastermind?
Remember what we talked about last time?\nAbout playing a song together?
Remember when I told you I bought five of\nToshia Soomy's books?
Remember when Yui couldn't go to the fields\nfor a while?
Remember! Yamagoshi-san and Masa-san have\npride in their ramen!
Remember, metal charms for how-to books and\nbookmarks for manga. Good luck!
Remember, moderation is important, Wonder.
Remember, service with a smile!
Remember, she advised us to memorize the\nlocations of the barcodes.
Remember, think pink. Take your time and\ntry again.
Remember, we're entering a new area, which\nmeans stronger enemies. Let's ensure we have\neverything we need before proceeding.
Remember, you gotta treat me like a lady!
Remember, you're never alone! As long as\nI'm still standing, at least.
Ren Amamiya.
Ren stops in front of the cr\xeape shop\nsometimes... Do high school boys really like\nto eat that stuff?
Ren's coffee's the best! It's the perfect\ndrink to sip as you chill!
Ren's grinding some beans right now.\nWant to join me for a cup or two?
Renren!
Renren.
Replacement for what?
Research has shown lifestyle diseases are\nprevalent among today's youth.
Resist it...
Resonate...?|What exactly do you mean?
Respecting those different from you. That's\na skill I want to learn. Like...
Retreat? But how!?
Return this to them.\nConfiscating personal effects is a big problem\nin today's climate.
Return to your classes immediately!
Return to your seats at once!
Returned?
Rewarding myself from time to time helps me\nstay motivated for training.
Ride a snowmobile.|Winter sports.|Let's build a snow fort!
Rides, food, the sky's the limit! So, no\nholding back, okay?
Ridiculous!
Right and wrong... We consider them\nopposites, but in truth, they're merely\ntwo sides of the same coin.
Right around then, the world started to\nbecome a lot freer, but also faced its fair\nshare of troubles too.
Right behind you!|Let's never look back!
Right now I'm the only one who's heard this.
Right now we need to figure out what this\n"Cursed Eye of Time" really is.
Right now you're persona non grata. We can't\nhave you making the students uneasy.
Right now, I want to...
Right now, it seems she has no space\nto decompress.
Right now, there are more bad people out there like Kiuchi going ignored by police...
Right now, you are not in the world you know. This realm is called the "Metaverse."
Right now?|Right here?
Right on the money! Amazing! You really\nthought this through, didn't you?
Right on!
Right on! Everyone loves chicken breast.\nDefinitely the best place to start.
Right on! There's lots of flavors, and it's\neasy to get all the nutrients you need.
Right on... Wassup, Persona...
Right then, question one! Our first category\nis "local shopping"!
Right this way please!
Right you are! It's derived from the Japanese\nword for ginger. Isn't that cool?
Right!
Right! Ah, but there's still lots of tickets\nlying around. Shouldn't we pick 'em up?
Right! First I need to get to the point where\nI can hit a home run!
Right! He's really phoning this shit in,\nain't he?
Right! I-I apologize. I got too excited.
Right! Just one test should give us enough\ndata for our hypothesis.
Right! Stand at the ready!
Right! That should help me feel more at ease.
Right! There was something like it in\nKiuchi's Palace! It disabled the trap!
Right!?
Right!? Apparently it's a branch of a popular Chinese restaurant that specializes in ramen.
Right!? I heard they recently changed their recipe and had a grand reopening! I can't wait to try it!
Right!? In fact, I've got something in mind\nright now.
Right!? It's really hard to believe seeing\nhow she is now.
Right!? Just thinking there are people like\nthat out there makes me so mad!
Right!? Maybe if we all run into you\nin the Metaverse someday, yeah?
Right!? Ninja arts, Eyes of Truth, all this\ncrap is just a way to stretch his\nshoddy premise...
Right!? What a lovely day!
Right!? You saw it was unsolvable too!
Right, I guess I never gave you my name.\nI'm Motoh... Er, Closer.
Right, I haven't given you my name. I'm <color=#FF423F>Yumi\nShiina</color>. And you are...?
Right, I just remembered! Let me talk to the\nmanager about rearranging the merchandise.
Right, I was talking about the quiz. Anyway,\nlet's get back to class.
Right, I will explain.
Right, I'll cut to the chase.
Right, I'm off to the counter. You want yours\nwarmed up?
Right, Riko?
Right, Wonder?
Right, about that... I've got good news\nand bad news.
Right, because the words are linked together.
Right, future plans! If you think of anything, let me know, okay?
Right, here's your pay. Hope to see you\nagain soon.
Right, let's check out the school store.\nAfter all, sometimes the best stuff is right\nunder your nose.
Right, let's enter that password. Got your\nnotebook, Shun?
Right, let's see what {PLAYER_NAME}-san\nhas to say! Go on, don't be shy, now.
Right, let's start practice.
Right, quality over quantity.
Right, right... So, what you're saying is,\nwe don't have to worry about them attacking us?
Right, so the earth makes a full revolution\naround the sun once per day, yes?
Right, that's the key point here.
Right, that's the one! I've heard it's a\ngood school.
Right, then we'll go over how to apply it today.
Right, then! Let's do it to it!
Right, time to pick some flowers. Big, bold\nones to celebrate new life.
Right, time to pick some flowers. Something\nvibrant and highly fragrant.
Right, time to sell\nsome flowers...
Right, we can't accept! I'd feel bad...
Right, we should go find him first and\nthen snatch the Core!
Right, we were discussing the remaining Treasures.
Right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!?
Right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun?\nLet's test your sense for nuance.
Right. And just between us, Panther\nloses it when it comes to sweet stuff.
Right. And the "Coming Soon" bit must be\nreferring to the day of the Food Fight.
Right. But remember, our goal is stealing the Treasure.
Right. Call everyone together when you're\nready to head out, Leader.
Right. Coming...
Right. Enough being a gloomy Gus!
Right. First locate a route to the Treasure, then send out the calling card... right?
Right. Here we're just regular\nhigh schoolers and an owl.
Right. Here's what you earned today.
Right. However, this visit may be especially\nchallenging. We'd best prepare accordingly.
Right. I'm kinda curious about what's going\non, too... Let's go check it out.
Right. I'm not sure if this is much of an\napology, but I'd love to show you what it\n*should* look like.
Right. I'm willing to bet that's why Kano\nran off in such a hurry before.
Right. In that case...
Right. It might be more convincing if you\nhad tools, but that'd be difficult to\ndo here...
Right. Just like last time, I'd like you to\nact as my advisor...
Right. Let's head back to the Palace and\nsniff it out.
Right. Let's investigate what's going on\nwith them!
Right. Let's regroup later tonight.
Right. My name's Shun Kano. Nice to meet ya.
Right. My situation's gotten better, but I\nshouldn't get a plant that needs too much\nattention to survive.
Right. Now that we're all here, let's do some\ngroup practice.
Right. The bread they sell there is great.\nI'll never get sick of it.
Right. The number of victims would certainly\ndecrease for starters. And if Menaces began\nto fear the Phantom Thieves...
Right. We're heading into the Metaverse to\ninfiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today, right?
Right...
Right... And "emend" means... what exactly?
Right... I wonder the same thing about\nKiuchi. Seems like he loved baseball ever\nsince he was a kid.
Right... Let me just fill you in on our discussion.
Right... Point my fingertips more... I need\nto convey bold conviction.
Right... So you're still playing baseball.
Right... Somethin' about how with that\nperson gone he was free to start over...
Right... Thanks.
Right... The Food Fight video. I saw it too.\nI'm really worried about Shun...
Right... Where do we even start?
Right... Yeah, that's a good call, Lufel.
Right... there!
Right...|Let's leave ASAP.
Right?
Right? ...Right!?
Right? Being a slow eater like myself has its\nperks\u2014uh, I mean, never mind.
Right? Glad we're on the same page!
Right? I always keep cash on me just in case.
Right? I even sewed on those accessories\nmyself to accent the green shades of the\ndress.
Right? I feel like the Monkey King when he\nfinally ascends to enlightenment!
Right? I slugged that pitcher like a pro!\nWait, you know that's not what pitching\nactually is though, right?
Right? I suppose it depends on the situation,\nbut I wouldn't even know where to even start.
Right? I was shocked.
Right? I'm sick of losing to those guys.
Right? It's got three holes in it. Maybe\nwe need the same number of balls?
Right? It's real weird.
Right? Kinda mysterious, but you can always\ncount on him!
Right? Last time we got a Core we had to\nbook it right away.
Right? Man, I dunno. At least with food,\nyou'll know when you try it.
Right? Now, let's see here...
Right? Someone could've been seriously\nburned if she hadn't gotten involved.
Right? That was one fine pass if I do say so myself.
Right? When you know this might be\nyour only chance to try it, you gotta get it!
Right? You like a good aftertaste, don't you?\nI got that feelin' when I was eatin'\nwith you.
Rightly said. How about we split into two\ngroups: one to fight off the enemies, and the\nother to secure the core?
Riko said she'll devise a strategy to deal\nwith Akashi, did she not?
Riko-senpai and I are close in age,\nso she used to come cheer us on at games and\nwe became friends.
Riko-senpai is so cool and kind. She's like a\nlone flower at the top of a mountain...
Riko-senpai is super rich.\nShe's the daughter of Umetane's president.
Riko-senpai looked like she was having fun\ntalking to Motoha...
Riko-senpai!
Riko-senpai!?
Riko-senpai's on a whole other playing field\nthan us.
Riko-senpai...
Rimi-chaaan!
Rings a bell.|I don't think I have...
Rising up against adversity takes a lot of\n<sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>. I'm sure you feel that within\nyourself as well.
Risky move?|What are we gonna do?
Ritsuka and I finished tidying\nthe club room and walked to\nthe station together.
Ritsuka, ever since {NAME1}-kun came along,\nyou've been a lot more optimistic.
Roast pork AND stewed eggs please.|Sorry for bringing him.
Robbing what exactly?|What's this "Treasure" you mentioned?
Robespierre also fought against inequality,\nbut all he gave the people was fear.
Rock, paper, go!
Roger that!
Roger that! In that case, I'll use this,\na little of that, and...
Roger that. Then let's find these things\nalready.
Roller coasters, haunted\nhouses... It seems like\na ton fun...
Roses are dazzling, and red ones symbolize\na confession or affectionate gesture.
Rows of thick books...
Ruin?|Is that some kind of joke?
Rumor has it Ms. Katayama and Riko had an\nargument in the Student Guidance Office. When\nMr. Akashi rushed to the scene...
Run along. I'll be waiting here.
Run for it, Lady Ann!
Run your mouth to the police,
Run!
Run! You promised!
Run, Kano!|Quick, get out of here!
Runa kept begging until\nI told her everything I love\nabout Shibuya...
Runa remained convinced of\nhow much danger Shichi-kun\nwas in...
Runa steadfastly refused my\nrequest for a home visit...
Russet! I'm setting this down here!
Russet! You're here! One moment!
Russet, if it's not too much trouble...
Russets aren't good enough for you? You\nreally are ambitious!
Ryoko asked me to take her dreams and make\nthem come true. Maybe I should really do it.
Ryoko!
Ryoko! That's not true, you just\u2014
Ryoko... You stayed to listen?
Ryuji and I have totally different styles,\nso maybe you guys are like that too?
Ryuji tried to down a whole bottle of soda in\none go earlier. He's actually really good at it...
S-Same!
S-Scared? Not exactly. I'm just not good\nwith, you know, Japanese horror movie stuff?
S-Sensei!?
S-Seriously!? Well, that's Harajuku for you.\nHere one minute and gone the next!
S-Shh... They'll find us...! Their sense of\nhearing is 100 times stronger than humans...
S-Shut your mouth! None of this would have happened if it weren't for this brat!
S-Sir! I told you you're...
S-So, this letter... Could you please...
S-So, what do you think?
S-Sorry!
S-Sorry, I... I'm gonna go grab something\nto drink...
S-Sorry, no can do! My place is tiny and a\nhuge mess! M-Maybe another time\u2014after I\nclean...
S-Sorry. That offer is quite hard to accept.
S-Spare, um... change?
S-Still... You shouldn't be here.
S-Stole?
S-Stop it! I'm not good with spooky stuff...
S-Stop it! That's mine!
S-Tier? That sounds like it should be\nthe highest rank.
SKREEEE!
Saaafe! That was really close!
Sadly, there are some that are prejudiced\nagainst light novels based on their genre\nand cover art.
Sadness can be a precursor to the seven\ndeadly sins, so black bile was not looked\nupon favorably.
Said he was the CEO of some company, I think?\nHe thanked me so much I felt bad.
Sakamoto-kun!?
Sakamoto.
Sakura-san, you keep a close eye on him, all right?
Salisbury Steak?|Omelette rice?
Same here. It doesn't really matter what we choose, anyway.
Same here. My grades in art class are\nalways crap.
Same to you.|Thank you.
Same... Is there any energy that we can use\naround here?
Sardonic?
Sato tripped over nothing,\nsending everything in his\nbriefcase flying again.
Sato's standing there\nteary-eyed...
Save the horseplay for dry land!
Save the tears for when you see her.|I'll say hi to her next time too.
Say hello to your fabulous producer,\nBesa! So glad you made it all this way.
Say hello|Keep walking
Say hello|Leave them alone
Say something|Just let her be
Say what needs to be said.|You have to explain yourself.|Hit her with your feelings!
Say what!? Then it's going to take more than brute force to stop them!
Say you want to use a hand warmer going to\nand from school but pause its reaction while\nin class. How would you do so?
Say, Wonder, have you noticed that we can\nsteal these Shadows' powers?
Say, after that, did you talk to my dad? That's, um...
Say, did you... defeat those scary-looking\nguys?
Say, do you know any good shows or movies\nlike that?
Say, does this place have any beds?
Say, how about we take a stroll around?
Say, that reminds me of a hoot of a question!\nAnyone know what's special about owl ears?
Say, the story takes a depressing turn, or\nthere's a sudden tragic ending.
Say, wanna do this again sometime? When our\nschedules line up, that is.
Say, what kind of style do you think would\nbe good for an autograph?
Say, would you mind if I continue to follow\nyour changes over time?
Say, {NAME1}-kun. After high school, what do you...
Say... Do you come by here often?
Saying I'm sorry for what I said just for the\nsake of making up doesn't feel right.
Saying cooking is just like that doesn't make\nmuch sense to me.
Scalded by an egg, kicked out halfway through, meat uneaten I may add...! Some celebration this turned out to be.
Scattering seeds, of course!
Scheme?|He intended to make a Joint Palace?
School and family stuff has been rough for\nthem lately, so they've been on edge.
School is a time for kids to broaden their\nhorizons and find themselves.
School! We skipped our afternoon classes!
School's almost over, so let's stop practice\nfor today and clean up.
Scolding them and suppressing their autonomy\nis a thing of the past. We must all respect each\nother as independent people.
Screw that! If I'm gonna be put on display\nlike some prize cow, then I'm quittin' too!
Screw that! It's you who's gotta go!
Scuse me. I don't remember the title but I'm\nlooking for an adventure novel set in space.
Search the Palace while avoiding fights\nwith Shadows.
Search the area for a way forward.
Searching it will be quite arduous. Let's\nbegin by checking the area around us.
Searching?|Like food?
Second question is coming in hot, so let's\nkeep it up!
Second, to speak first and win, villainous\nas that may seem...
Second, to strike first and win, villainous\nas that may seem.
Secondly, the shadows will need time to reassemble their forces.
Secret ingredient... secret ingredient...\nAh, {NAME2}! What secret ingredient should\nI add to the curry?
See here, kids? This guy was able to get\nthe stamp.
See how no plants grow in this spot? This\nmeans his sinister corpse will soon arise!
See if you can find them all...\nThough, you don't have to\nif you don't want to...
See it through, <color=#72C5FF>Chiyome</color>!
See that key over there?
See ya later then.
See ya!
See ya.
See you again sometime!
See you again, Sensei!
See you around, partner!
See you around, {NAME1}-kun.
See you around.
See you later!
See you later, then... I'll be in touch.
See you later.
See you later. Don't stay out too late just\nbecause your parents aren't home!
See you later. Feel free to practice at your\nown pace. I'm just happy you joined.
See you next time!
See you then! Now you take care of yourself,\nyou hear?
See you!
See you!|Let's do this again sometime.
See you, {NAME2}-chan!
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about!\nUgh, I can't win.
See, what did I tell you? Learning a few\nwords probably made it a bit easier to\nremember the other names too, right?
See? Haruna-chan's really good at math!
See? I don't care what they say, those two\nare in perfect sync.
See? I told you she'd say no. Tanemura-san\ncan't hang.
See? Math does help you in life. Though it\ndoesn't need to be useful to be beautiful.
See? {NAME1}-kun's starving. We're up for it\nif you are, Kotone-san!
Seeing all these young people here today\nkinda boosted my spirits.
Seeing him then... I don't know, it was like\nthe emotions were almost too much to handle.
Seeing hooligans as beldames? Fascinating.\nWitnessing such a sight does sound\nentertaining to say the least.
Seeing someone I know brings a certain\nsense of relief. By the way... may I sketch\nyou?
Seeing someone who loves Shibuya just as\nmuch as I do... Ah, this is what I live for!
Seeing the joy on your faces from eating my soup made the effort worth it.
Seeing the world through\nthe scientist's eyes gave\nme new <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>...
Seeing you has given me hope, in a way.\nI'm very lucky to have met you, {NAME1}.
Seems easy enough.|Can I hear it again?
Seems fun.|What were you doing?|Where'd you get a helicopter?
Seems he has put up a barrier attuned to\nour attacks... How troublesome.
Seems it left.
Seems it's chosen the target for its next\nattack... Keep your guard up!
Seems kinda violent... It's not gonna start\nsnapping at us, is it?
Seems like I can play it on\nthe game console in my room.\nMaybe I should try it out...
Seems like I had convinced myself there was only so much I could do for her.
Seems like Kano-kun's not here yet.
Seems like Komatsu likes to\nrun all year round...
Seems like Merope has an\nimportant matter to discuss. I\nshould go to the Velvet Room.
Seems like Merope wants to\nsay something. I should go\nto the Velvet Room.
Seems like Mom and Dad\nare enjoying their trip...
Seems like Motoha wants to\ntalk. I should go and see her.
Seems like Ms. Katayama's in a bad mood.
Seems like Shota isn't\nany less quick-thinking\nthan Haruna...
Seems like Shun has\nsomething to talk about.\nI should go see him.
Seems like Shun wants to use\nmy kitchen for something.\nI should head over now.
Seems like a fun place to\nvisit with somebody...
Seems like a good place to\ninvite somebody...
Seems like a nice place to\nvisit with somebody...
Seems like everyone had fun with it!
Seems like her appearance when\nshe was young is important to\nTomiyama's identity.
Seems like it's still the center of all the\nlatest trends. I'm glad that's stayed the\nsame.
Seems like it. Maybe the money is actually\ngiving him power?
Seems like one of them is human...\nThey're struggling against the Shadows too.
Seems like she spends time\nwith them until their parents\nget home from work...
Seems like she was really\nimmersed in her practice...
Seems like she's drunk...
Seems like she's still\na little drunk...
Seems like some sort\nof switch...
Seems like that unlocked it... Let's check\nthat door from earlier.
Seems like that's not all of the cameras and\nelectric fences, though. Couldn't there be\nother electrical boxes around?
Seems like the potato moles\nwon't be coming back.
Seems like there's a big one headed this way. That must be what I was sensing earlier.
Seems like there's someone\nin the back of the store.\nThey must be getting ready...
Seems like things have calmed down now.\nOkay, let's teach you how to play.
Seems like we still have some time before night settles in.
Seems like we won't be getting in through the front door.
Seems like you handled the customers well.
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.
Seems she's been swinging\nthis whole time.
Seems so. Let's keep that in mind.
Seems something like a Core is over that\nway, but touching one of those red beams\nsummons enemies.
Seems that way. Maybe we need a\ndifferent keycard?
Seems to be a load of buttons on this thing.\nI'll just go ahead and press 'em!
Seems we have no choice but to fight.\nLet's go, Wonder!
Seems we need to <color=#FF423F>make a certain number reach\n50</color> or Thoth won't be satisfied.
Seems we were able to learn something\nrather useful.
Seems we're in the Third Bailey from the\nlooks of it.
Seems you've beaten your old high score.
Seen him on the rooftop before.|My guess? Instant ramen, rooftop.
Sei Shounagon... Talk about beauty and brains!\nOr at least I think so!
Seiji and I pondered together\nuntil he reached a decision...
Senpai always gave us that juice to drink\nafter practice.
Senpai is just a reserve player, but he\nstill hasn't given up on becoming\nfirst-baseman!
Senpai! Not here...!
Senpai, what can we do about this!?\nWhat else should we investigate!?
Sense of taste...? Ohhh, you mean about the broth at Victory Kitchen!
Sensei!
Sensei! Can you hear me!? Sensei!
Sensei! Forgive me for my actions! I'll forget everything I saw,\nso please just let me out of here!
Sensei! Hey! Are you free today? I've got\nsomething important to talk to you about.
Sensei! Sudden, I know, but do you like\nbrown sugar syrup or vinegar and soy sauce\nfor tokoroten noodles?
Sensei, Listen! You don't wanna fight either,\nright? Let's all calm down!
Sensei, we want to help you.
Sensei...
Sensei... I promise we'll come back for\nyour Treasure!
Sensei... No...
Sensei... is that you? That attire...
Sensei...?
Sensei?
Serfs, kill them!
Seriously though, what's with this door?\nWho the hell needs a door that big?
Seriously though... what're we gonna do about him?
Seriously!?
Seriously!? Okay! Wonder, grab that end! Wait, is this even gonna fit inside... Cattle?
Seriously!? So this was, like, an exclusive\ndebut!? Damn, I should've recorded it!
Seriously!? That's a long way to go. And it\nmeans there are more people out there\nlike Miyazawa?
Seriously, don't sweat it.|Hey, it's fine.
Seriously, thanks so much! A gift from\nSensei... It's like a dream!
Seriously, that was unbelievable!
Seriously. You and Closer both have\noutrageous appetites...
Seriously? All the more reason to call\nthem out!
Seriously? I can't believe Kadota lost.
Seriously? I was stuck in line for ages at\nthe pharmacy too.
Seriously? Like you'd be able to help with anything...
Seriously? Like you're gonna make it from\nscratch!?
Seriously? Man, god bless the Menace. Always givin' us somethin' to talk about.
Seriously? They're just throwing us to the\nwolves? Okay, um, where's that manual...?
Seriously? Well, if you're interested...\nThanks!
Seriously? What kind of a rumor is that?
Seriously? Wow! Thanks, Mona!
Seriously? Wow, I guess young guys like you\nare pretty strong...
Seriously? Wow, how do you even do that?\nI'm always sleeping in right 'til the last\nsecond.
Seriously? You know how to make videos?
Seriously? You sure it wasn't a carrier pigeon?
Seriously?\nWho even cares?
Serves him right.|That's not great.|I would've done the same.
Settle down, Skull. That's not real money.
Settle down. I said I have something\nto announce.
Sexually harassing female students...
Shadow detected!
Shadows ahead of us. It doesn't seem like\nwe'll be able to avoid them.
Shadows are the embodiment of a human's hidden, inner self. That form is a manifestation of his desires.
Shadows could burst in here any minute. We must find some means of escape.
Shadows exist in conjunction with their\nreal-life counterparts. They manifest the\ndesires of their other self.
Shadows pretending to be statues, huh?\nGet ready to fight!
Shadows won't be coming to steal our desires in here, so we can prepare and strategize at ease.
Shadows, the Metaverse, and what becomes of\nthose people who've lost all desire.
Shadows... But our destination is just ahead.\nWe're going to have to fight them.
Shadows? I don't know what those are, but I\ndidn't run into any trouble.
Shall I do the honors?
Shall we <color=#FF423F>enter</color>, Wonder?
Shall we <color=#FF423F>retrace our steps</color>? There may be a\n<color=#FF423F>locked</color> door back there.
Shall we begin?
Shall we call it a day?
Shall we get going?
Shall we go right now?
Shall we open the final chest, Wonder?
Shall we return home, then?
Shall we take these with us?
Shall we try exiting the painting for now?
Sharing intel, succeeding in missions... We're really starting to feel like a proper cohort.
Shaver box!? You don't need those stinky old cheese graters!
Shaver boxes? Ohhh, you mean those stinky\nold cheese grater things?
She asked if I could help her with some\nmath problems, so I've been teaching her\nformulas and solutions.
She called me later, actually. Said she used\na cooling-off period to cancel it without\ntelling her boss.
She certainly seems to enjoy your company. Now then, shall we head to school?
She changes into a delivery uniform in a\npublic bathroom, then races off on a bicycle.
She claims to have seen it over there. And\nshe mentioned it was slender.
She convinced women all over Japan to gather intel for her.
She could explode at any time.\nThat's the state she was in when she came to talk\nto me that day.
She definitely seems to be\nfeeling down...
She develops recipes, plans events, and is,\nlike, one of the truest culinary\nprofessionals!
She did mention the batting cages... Probably\nthe ones in Yongen-Jaya...
She didn't say we weren't allowed to move!
She doesn't look so good...
She doesn't seem to be around.\nI should look for her.
She dreamed of being a baseball player.
She ended up getting seriously injured, and\nthat's why she can no longer play baseball,\nher favorite game...
She ended up marrying the same man she had\nbeen betrothed to from the very beginning.\nAn ironic twist of fate.
She feels guilty about it, huh? Maybe we can\ntrust her then.
She has a first aid kit on\nhand? She must be used\nto taking care of injuries.
She has acted as a vital turning point in\nboth of our lives.
She has lots of tickets.|She has plenty of time left.
She has such unshakeable optimism. Perhaps\nyou've learned a bit about <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> as well?
She hasn't been f-f-fired!\nShe was just sent home is all...
She hasn't started performing\nyet. It looks like she's\nmissing something...
She ignored me.
She ignored my order...
She invited me to join her band, and that's\nwhat got me into music.
She is able to handle her duties efficiently\nwhile keeping an eye on you.
She just showed me her competition costumes\non her phone too...
She kind of reminds me of a teacher I had in\nmiddle school. She even gets me nervous.
She knows our names now. That makes me kinda\nhappy.
She likes to make her own puzzles and\ngive them to people.
She looked so sad... I can't help but worry\nabout her.
She loves music, just like me.
She loves music. Especially singing.
She made her offer after findin' out all\nabout me. There's no way I can back out now.
She meets with a college math professor\nevery week. She even discovered a new\ntheorem!
She might end up the same!?
She might've. I'm not the best at bein'\nintrospective after all.
She must have known you disappeared from the train because she witnessed it happen.
She probably just feels uneasy about your\nlack of experience.
She really appreciated how concerned I was\nfor her.
She really is such a cute little girl...
She really outdid herself.\nI bet she could have a future in theater.
She really wants to become a lawyer\nafter all!
She received her first prize jointly with her\nhusband, Pierre...
She rejected me unfortunately. Hahahaha!
She replied right away.\nApparently, her friend\nsaid yes.
She said it can withstand the proccessing though,\nso I guess it'll be okay.
She said she comes around Shibuya Station a\nlot, right? I hope we get to see her again...
She said she has some errands to run first,\nso she wants us to meet her in Kichijoji\ntonight.
She said she wanted to go back soon if\nshe could.
She said she'd come get you as soon as she's\ndone with work. Play with us until\nthen, okay?
She said she's gonna bring him to\nShibuya today!
She said the boy pictured in the video\nlooked like Kano-kun, and wanted to ask if\nI knew anything.
She says I'm different lately.
She seems even drunker than\nusual today...
She should be at the farm later. I hope\nyou'll see her there.
She should be fine to play just for fun, but as a player she...
She should be here any second...
She should be here soon. Would you like to\ncome back later?
She solved the whole problem\nin her head...!
She sure interrogated the hell out of me!\nQueen was convinced I was a bad guy when\nwe first bumped into each other.
She talks of life's ups and downs...\nLet us strive to learn as much as we\ncan from her in that regard.
She teaches class 2C, so 23?|Add the letters in Kumi to get 54?
She thrust the TOS along\nwith other important-looking\ndocuments into my hands.
She told me a bit about herself before. She said\nher father died when she was little...
She told me about you too. She said you came to see me at the hospital. Thanks for that.
She told me all about herself. Her family,\nwhat shops she goes to, even her favorite\nbakery!
She told me too how grateful she was.\nShe sounded so full of life...
She turned them down at first, but she seems\nreally lost on what to do.
She wants to help people in need; the same\nway she wanted to help her mother way back\nwhen.
She wants to make a deal...
She wants to wait until after elementary\nschool, but they told us they'd welcome her\nany time!
She was a nurse, and a really cool one at that.
She was a nurse, and a really cool one at that. She was a strong person, too.
She was able to talk to me just fine.
She was always reaching out to me, but I\njust kept...
She was famous back then, you know. Lightning\nLegs Katayama, they called her.
She was fantastic.|I could never pull that off.
She was like, "Screw you and your new\nmoney!" and blew the baddies away!
She was pretty cute though, so she'll\nprobably go far.
She was pretty young, probably about your\nage, but her performance was beyond\nher years!
She was pushed into a corner, and ended up\nawakening to a supernatural power... That\nmust sound familiar, right?
She was still depressed by the time she started high school.
She was supposed to compete in a tournament with the baseball team...
She was suspended for being a Menace, right?
She wasn't lying, I'd bet my muscles on it.\nDon't you think that's enough?
She went through so many procedures, like calling to the woman, getting an AED...
She will likely recover before too long.\nIf the light gets stronger, her attacks will\nlikely intensify as well.
She'd always stop by on her way home for a\nbowl a ramen sayin', "I rode to the dam\ntoday!"
She'd go ridin' her bike all over the place\ntryin' to forget about her troubles.
She'd love for you to try it, if you\ndon't mind.
She'll be back soon.|Do you like her?
She'll have to know we're there for her!\nWe'll prepare a cheer song just for\nKotone-san!
She's a great teacher. She really saved my\nhide once too.
She's a pitcher, so I got her the one shaped like a baseball, and she gave me the catcher's mitt.
She's a real busybody that insists she can help with the shop and watch those kids at the same time.
She's always been really smart. I don't hate\nher or resent her or anything.
She's an amazing figure skater. Multiple\nworld championship winner amazing.
She's awake again, but... Walking is going to take her a while, they say...
She's been a little bundle of curiosity ever\nsince she was small.
She's been all up in my business lately.
She's been hard to get a hold of lately, so I\nfound myself putting off this errand.
She's been pretty down ever since... but\nlately, she seems to be getting more upbeat,\nwhich is a big relief.
She's been swinging that bat\nnonstop for about an hour.
She's being modest. Both her singing and\nguitar playing were mesmerizing.
She's doing this for you.|That's Closer's style.
She's exactly right.|We believe in you.|You are a little cheeky though.
She's exhausted from her Persona awakening.
She's fine. I think she's just worried about\nwhy Taiko's so antsy.
She's flying!?
She's focused her aim on one of us! Keep\nyour guard up and defend yourselves!
She's giving me puppy-dog\neyes... I don't think she'll\ntake no for an answer.
She's gonna be famous soon for sure!\nWe should get her autograph while we can!
She's gonna call Shota-kun's mom and have\nher bring him here!
She's helping Mr. Higashino compose music\nfor us.
She's in danger...!
She's in student council president mode...
She's not attacking, but I don't think she\nhears us either.
She's not going to attack us, is she?
She's not in the best mental space right now,\nso I let her go home early.
She's not like Kiuchi and Miyazawa at all.\nIf we try talking to her, she might just give\nus her Treasure.
She's only in fourth grade, but she's already\nbeen accepted to a college in the US.
She's pretty spry for her age, though her\nhealth's taken a turn for the worse recently.
She's probably picking out drinks for us too. She's always putting other people first...
She's raised Yukimi-san to be her successor.\nPretty harshly, from the sounds of it.
She's right about that. I may have found\nmyself in a similar predicament if it wasn't\nfor Panther.
She's right. Kotone-san used to wear this...\nEven I heard about that. It was everywhere.
She's so awesome! I wanna train so I can bat\nlike her.
She's so kind and gracious... I should\nwork up the courage to greet her, too,\nif I see her.
She's strong enough to face the pressure of a\nworldwide tournament without batting an eye,\nand yet she gets treated so horribly.
She's such a kind person. I know that better\nthan anybody.
She's suppressing her own desire. What\nastounding mental fortitude!
She's thinking she wants to stay with our\nclub and not go back to her old band.
She's waiting at the treasure.|You really think she'd do that?
She's wanted to be a professional musician\never since high school.
She's won all sorts of competitions. And\nshe's on the news ALL the time.
She's your friend, right? Your one and only!
She... Arai, she could tell. She knew the taste of Victory Kitchen's soup was different.

So Kiuchi and Miyazawa were shunned by the collective unconscious the same way we were kicked into this new area?
So Kiuchi was a baseball player? That doesn't match the impression he gave off in Shibuya.
So Kiuchi's Palace is still here!?
So Kiuchi's perversion toward women drives his desire for revenge, causing his Shadow to run amok.
So Kiuchi-san, now that Rimi-chan's gone...

So don't go tellin' folks about this, okay?
So either it was stolen by the culprit, or\u2014maybe,\njust maybe\u2014the victim misplaced it...?
So even if I don't recognize\nthem, these people will\nmaterialize as my allies...?
So even if my critiques are all lies, the public will slurp it up and run the place right out of business.
So far, I haven't actually heard anything\nfrom him or his agency...
So first I do this...\nThen I press this button...\nAnd last but not least...
So from here on out, we find the Palace in each area, steal the Treasure, then move on to the next one.
So from tomorrow onward,\nyou may see me around the school,\nobserving classes and such...

So here's your chance to surrender. What do\nyou say?
So here. You can take this. It's one of my\nmost treasured cards!

So how about it? Want to come help me\nout again?
So how about we measure Treasure in "Lufels"\ninstead? Now there's an idea!
So how should we proceed? There does not\nseem to be any way around them...
So how're we supposed to go down?
So humans eat more than the required amount\nto survive, as a method of managing stress...\nI can sense the distortions of desire.
So if we start going off track...
So if we steal that thing, it'll change\nMiyazawa's heart? You said it was the reason\nfor his twisted desires, right?
So if we'd defeated it, Ms. Katayama might\nnot have used violence against Mr. Akashi?
So if you ever hear anything about\nShichi-kun's actor, fill me in, okay?
So if you go for a run in winter, you'll want\nto pick a park with evergreens to block\nthe wind!

So it is with extra special thanks that I\ngive you this rare book.
So it won't be long until they'll be serving\nramen at Leblanc, hmm? Heh heh.
So it won't open without the right\npasscode...
So it'd be a shame not to make some together.\nA nice drink sounds like a good place to\nstart...
So it'd be best for you to pose as a patient so we can get some. Don't mess it up, all right?
So it's Miyazawa's idea for a movie, then.\nHe did say something about a script...
So it's not an ouroboros, but just a regular\nsnake monster?
So it's the same book?|What changed?
So it's your pet?
So it... rewinds time? Wow, these cameras can\nreally do anything...
So just beat the hell out of him, right? Got it!
So just leave the rest to me.
So just plain bean sprouts, then?
So kabuki has continued evolving to\nentertain modern audiences. That sort of\ndesire is worthy of praise.
So keep an eye out for the details. Try not to go running scared before then, kid.

So let's do this!
So let's make your muscles melon-sized!\nWe're gonna target the whole body today.
So let's settle this today, once and for all!\nTake us to your friends, Take-kun.
So long as it looks like a cocktail and it's\nnon-alcoholic, it's a mocktail!
So long as the enemy thinks our weapons are real, they'll function in the same way real ones do.
So long as we don't destroy it. Show\nrestraint when you attack it.
So long as you steadfastly cultivate desire, a path will surely open itself to you.
So look forward to it getting even more\nflavorful, {NAME2}-kun!
So many different accessories...
So many humans don't even care about\ntheir own desires; what's a coin or two to\nthem?
So many of them, yourself included, just feel\nmore mature than we were back then, you know?
So many unique ways of counting... Human\ninventions like these are truly impressive.
So much has happened here. Like the first\ntime you listened to me sing...
So much has happened here... Like the first\ntime you listened to me sing.
So much to do, so much to see! What should we\ncheck out today?
So much trendy stuff!
So no skipping. Just go back and try that\none again. Then you can get your prize.
So nobody really knows why, huh? Well, it's\nnot important now, I guess.
So now all we can do is just give up!
So now that I've been given this opportunity,\nI thought I'd do for my nephew what I\ncouldn't fo\u2014
So now's my chance, huh. As someone with\nexperience beyond my years, I'll be sure to\ntake your advice to heart.

So out of curiosity... How much cash do you\nhave on you?
So please, don't forget to write your name!
So please, help me out here! Please,\nProfessor {NAME1}?
So please, will you train with me!?
So retreating is our best option, isn't it?\nIt seems our only path is through that door.
So she asked me what I do when I need to\nmotivate myself, and... well, I take a deep\nbreath, and shout...
So she quit all a that and started studyin'\nhard to be a teacher.
So she's suggesting an alliance of those\nsuspicious of Akashi... A deal of sorts.
So should I water it some more?
So shut up, or the next crack of the bat's gonna be a skull splitter!
So sleepy... Just gonna put my head down...
So someone like you, I guess? They got\na hooded goblin with them too?
So thanks for that, {NAME2}!
So thanks. I'm not going to give up yet!
So that Palace wasn't Ms. Katayama's...\nIt was Mr. Akashi's?
So that behavior was going on long before\nAkashi came into the picture.
So that box was...|Why is he doing this?
So that guy from earlier was...|So the guy in black who saved us...
So that means...
So that means...!
So that thing we talked about before... The conversation I wanted you there for?
So that's Joker? Even on that old monitor,\nyou can see he's got some serious moves!
So that's basically the deal.
So that's how it works?|That monster.|He's stealing her desires.
So that's the long and short of how this is\ngonna go. Put simply...
So that's what a <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> is... There's no\nneed to panic though.
So that's what made you target\nVictory Kitchen?
So that's what you meant.|A page from Pops's book.|I wanna try some...
So that's what you're into... Uh, didn't mean\nthat in a weird way.
So that's when I made up my mind. I'm going\nto marry these cr\xeapes!
So that's where it was...
So that's where you come in, {NAME1}-san...
So that's why he said that...
So that's why the video of you throwing\nwater at Miyazawa never aired...
So that's why we couldn't tell you even if we\nwanted. We'll probably forget this too...
So that's your motive for bringing us here.\nA shrewd business plan indeed.
So the "Metaverse" embodies the collective\nunconscious of humankind. And this\ndam facility...
So the Mint loses two yen for every one-yen\ncoin it makes. Other coins make up for it,\nthough.
So the Subway Slammer Menace... was him?
So the Subway Slammer's been declared a Menace. Now what? Everyone already knows there's nothing they can do to stop me!
So the act of emptying one's mind gives rise to inner beauty.
So the currency you usually use might just\ndisappear? I suppose you'd get used to it\nonce it's gone...
So the dam turns Katayama's wrath into\nenergy, which Akashi absorbs?
So the door didn't open to let us through...
So the enemies will come once we trip the\nsensor, yes?
So the kid thought he could outsmart\nhis teacher, and wound up trapped\nin mind detention...
So the next Palace ruler must be someone doing bad things in secret.
So the next step is the calling card.
So the one who posted her name\nto Divine Justice was...!
So the owner, Pops, decided to open Victory Kitchen as a sort of training ground for aspiring chefs.
So the park became the domain of\nmutant pigs... Frankenswine's monsters,\nif you will!
So the pilot fulfilled his destiny and\nbecame the pharaoh of legend...
So the rumors were right...
So the truth behind the Hall of Lament was...\nbawling out your feelings.
So the truth behind the Harrowed Grounds,\none of the school's terrifyingly threatening\nmysteries...
So the two mermaids were able to see past\ntheir scales and learned to love one another.\nHow heartwarming.
So the unlocked door was a trap! How could\nI have fallen for something so simple...
So the victims are left with no recourse but to give up, as their faith in the world erodes away.
So the weight of gems is important enough\nthat they command different units?
So their entire school was cast into a\ndemonic realm... That sounds like an even\nmore dangerous situation than ours.
So then, I look forward to the next\ntreasure hunt.
So then, Kiuchi will admit what he did to Tomoko?
So then, what should I talk about?
So then, what'd ya think of the flavor? Suit your taste all right?
So then... you really are...
So then... {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
So there IS something you really want to do.
So there're seven Treasures in total, meaning we have six left to find?
So there's loads of time for us to do stuff\ntogether before that, Shota-kun!
So there's lots of different kinds of\nprotein. Which one are you feelin' today?
So there's no point in us making a fuss over\nit. Now get to class before you're all late.
So these are your personal quarters... I see,\nhow intriguing.
So they stay true to who they are, huh?\nI like people like that.
So they're doing dance practice on the\nslippery rocks by the sea, but is that really\na good idea?
So this ball was the root of Kiuchi's twisted desires, huh? Seems like the kind of thing anyone would have lying around...
So this is Kiuchi's Palace, huh? Looks a lot more like a baseball stadium to me.
So this is Ms. Katayama's Treasure...
So this is Shibuya! Rumor has it the people\nhere radiate with the aura of the sun.
So this is how it feels to take a photo with\nyour idol. I am remarkably moved.
So this is my way of makin' our yakitori\nextra special.
So this is the aura I sensed from Take-kun...
So this is the cooling facility... Those\nfans are huge!
So this is the first step in that journey.
So this is the fortress of the\nchosen ones...
So this is the infamous shoyu chicken broth!\nWhat a beautiful clear soup!
So this is the new area? It feels pretty different to the last one.
So this is the security room. We should look\naround.
So this is the station closest to your\nschool? I guess you must always be using it,\nthen!
So this is the underground vault. I see\nthere are quite a lot of Shadows here.
So this is today's investigation?|We came here just for that?|You seem nervous today.
So this is your neighborhood, huh.
So this is your school, huh, Sensei? It's\nbeautiful.
So this is... Katayama-san's Palace?
So this time I added pickled plum and shiso.\nGotta keep the taste interesting so you\ndon't get tired of it, you know?
So this time, I want to create something\nthat will resonate with people a bit more.
So this video's probably from the time after Kiuchi was reprimanded by the club about his slump.
So to compensate for that, I thought I could\nalso take a video to discuss what I wanted\nto communicate about the motif.
So to see a youngster like yourself take an interest in secondhand goods...
So to sum that all up... I failed completely.
So today I wanna see how hard these arms can\nswing.
So true. Being in a phantom thief outfit\nallows you to pull off moves you can't\nusually do.
So try not to be a smart aleck, okay?\nBecause you probably make just as many\nmistakes without realizing.
So uhhh, let's table the Treasure talk for now...
So until then, you'll be tasting lots and\nlots of my mocktails, okay?
So we can just find out where the treasure\nis by looking at this?
So we can't rule out the possibility that\nMagatsukami just picks them arbitrarily.
So we can't take everything back with just the change of heart. Okay, well, this time it's my turn to be there for Tomoko.
So we decided that from now on, we'll be open\nand honest with each other.
So we follow the hints on the floor, and that\nshould activate the mechanism.
So we gotta fight
So we have to pull some phantom thievery and steal another six Treasures.
So we head there first?
So we just need to chop these guys up?
So we just need to find the power and take it\nout. Let's look around here first.
So we need to reach the other side while\n<color=#FF423F>avoiding the enemy</color>? Better keep quiet!
So we want to avoid the red ones. Gotcha!
So we will simply force it to open its\nmouth... Yes, I think that could be worth a try.
So we're not getting out of here till we find some sort of switch? Okay, then let's get searching, Wonder!
So we've risen in the ranks of Kiuchi's fan\nclub, huh? Can't say I'm exactly thrilled...
So whadda we do now?
So what are our options?|Is there nothing we can do?
So what are you here for today?
So what brings you out this late?
So what can I do for you today?
So what is it? Why'd you make us come all\nthe way up here?
So what is it?|What kind of help do you need?
So what next?
So what organization is after you today?
So what should I buy? This? Ah, no.
So what then? Make up superficially? Lie and\nsay I didn't mean what I said? That won't\nhelp Yukimi-san.
So what will you do?
So what's it gonna be?
So what's it gonna be? You want me to cancel\nthe press and the sales position?
So what's the code name for this operation? Hmm...
So what's the fewest number of syllables\nthat a kimariji can have in this game?\nGive me your best shot!
So what's the plan today? Should we hit Mementos?
So what, they're having Tanemura-senpai do\ntheir jobs for them? That's ridiculous!
So what? I'm too busy to wait. Don't you\nworry, that kid will come.
So where are we gonna go? I want to see\nsomewhere new!
So where did we leave off talking before?
So which do you like more, vintage films or\nthe more recent stuff?
So which do you prefer?\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!
So which side are you on?
So why am I stuck being some worthless office worker?
So why are you here? Is it about the\nFood Fight? 'Cause we already talked about\nthis. I know it's a setup.
So why did you call us here?
So why does {NAME1}-kun have the exact same app on his phone?
So would that mean each area has its own Palace with its own Treasure?
So yeah, don't mind me...
So yeah, that's my kind of thing. I'm really\ninto the classic stuff.
So yeah, that's the recipe. Oh, right.
So yeah, there's a huge age gap! Is that a bad\nthing?
So yeah, time for me to buckle down. Today\nmarks the start of another round of recipe\ntesting.
So yeah, we just came here outta nowhere\nand entered the castle...
So you are saying it resembles a Palace that\nhas already collapsed? And what makes it\ndifferent?
So you can't find it?
So you do know! Isn't Shichi-kun the cutest?
So you guys are into cosplay...?
So you kept trying until it worked out?
So you know everything, huh...? Turns out\nI was the one being swindled.
So you know what that means! I'll be coming\nback for more advice another time!
So you know what that means...
So you like to pass the buck? That's just\nlike the real Akashi!
So you mean he...!
So you noticed how I felt and managed to put\ntogether a drink to lift my mood?
So you really did start out with a love for baseball...
So you should cherish not getting hangovers\nand stuff while you can, hehehe.
So you still haven't noticed, huh...
So you think that if I tap out the rhythm\nfirst, it'll feel more natural to start\nsinging?
So you two are fine with just cup ramen and\na piece of bread?
So you were listening... Tch.
So you wish for the power to kill, even\nif others abhor you? In that case, I shall\nbecome your mask.
So you'll be instituting work reforms?
So you're Wonder. I've heard about you. Yes...\nSomething about you does resemble Joker.
So you're a regular here, Sae-san?
So you're a second year too, huh, {NAME1}? Nice to meet you!
So you're implying that anything with energy\ncan be filtered...
So you're just gonna hide among your fakes?\nYou coward!
So you're my mom now?|Looks like I have a stepmom...
So you're not saying it's impossible.
So you're saying that creepy building over\nthere is this Palace we're looking for?
So you're saying you also gave in to the\nbeach house delicacies too, Tomoko?
So you're studying stuff we've never\nheard of again. Is that actually useful\nat all?
So you're the little rats who snuck into my\ncastle. Have you come for my head?
So you're the new part-timer, huh?\nThank goodness.
So you're the one Minami said she was gonna go get. You've got something to talk about?
So you're {NAME1}, huh? Arai was telling me\nabout you!
So you've been through a lot, too. You know,\nat times like this, I like to...
So you've come after all.
So you've returned. Might I take that to mean you wish to accept my offer?
So {NAME2}, have you ever done sprint\ntraining in the sand before?
So {NAME2}, will you indulge me?
So, Cattle, you really know a lot of stuff about the Metaverse and Palaces, huh?
So, Dad. I have something important to talk to you about.
So, Emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have\nbuilt the original Great Wall to protect\nthe people against invaders...
So, I figured that reading up on Japan...
So, I looked up the etymology of "wed"\nand found it's because it was originally\nonly used in limited situations.
So, I mentioned before how I used to enjoy\ndancing, right? Well, I got really into it.
So, I think it's time for the next accident!
So, I thought now would be a great chance for\nyou guys to get to know him better.
So, I want to try makin' somethin' totally\nout of my wheelhouse.
So, I want you to check out Buchiko at\nnight for me!
So, I was hoping you'd be willing to help\nme study again...
So, I was really frustrated that there was\ntrouble to deal with on our farm as well.
So, I will ask you this once...
So, I'd like you to tidy up this time.
So, Kano-kun... This means your entry for\ntoday is...
So, Leader, from here on you're not living just for yourself anymore.
So, Lufel, are we here because you have\nsomething to tell us?
So, Lufel, this materialization thing you're talking about... How are we supposed to do that?
So, Sensei... Would you happen to have...\na little more time to spare?
So, about the language of flowers...
So, allow me to ask you once more. Please,\nmay I take your photograph?
So, any of the shops catch your eye?
So, anything you want to eat?
So, apparently Take-kun is still buying up\nall of that juice.
So, are we heading to Mementos today?
So, based on today's date and your\nstudent numbers...
So, before that happens, we must prevent\nthis place from expanding.
So, before this creative inspiration fades,\nlet's head out and start shooting right away.
So, before we begin our interviews, I think\nwe should decide on our first topic.
So, between their two Shadows, he seems to\nbe the one in charge.
So, can I talk now?
So, can we change Miyazawa's heart\ntoo, {NAME1}?
So, can you see your house from here,\n{NAME1}-san? Which side would it be?
So, cigarette smoking is prohibited below the\nage of 20... I suppose you're too young then!
So, could you tell Haruna that I'm sorry I\ncan't play with her anymore?
So, even without "it," you still manage to question your own will?
So, forgive me if I'm wrong, but do you live\naround here?
So, get this... There's supposed to be some\npretty valuable prizes right now. And I know\nwhich machines are easy to win. Heheh.
So, going forward I would like us to avoid\ndiscussing our work in front of others\nwherever possible.
So, how's it feel to have run 15 kilos?\nIt's a real sense of accomplishment, huh?
So, how's it going?
So, how's that? The secret origin of the\ncr\xeape shop girl! Wasn't it a great story?
So, if I can't sleep peacefully, I've just\ngotta open the shop back up, right?
So, if someone really did manipulate\nMiyazawa... Then they're the reason he ended\nup that way, right?
So, if you want, you could take it...
So, in regard to Akashi's PC...
So, in the worst case...
So, inserting an incorrect book must set off\nthe alarm.
So, it seems it is not one of Wonder's allies\neither. Simply discussing the matter isn't\ngetting us any closer either...
So, it's a sensor-based trap. What should we\ndo, Wonder?
So, it's um... It's a little childish\nactually. I'm kind of embarrassed to ask.
So, just as I feared, Leo-chan's been down\never since that audition.
So, leader... We're counting on you.
So, let me officially welcome you to the Kokatsu Academy Soccer Team.
So, like...
So, listen. I really, really don't want you\ngetting hurt or anything.
So, mind facing off against me in a round of penalty kicks?
So, now I'm trying to think of good ways to\nlose that weight again... Ahaha...
So, now that we have a grasp of how Ancient\nEgypt was orientated, we can cover its\npolitics and culture.
So, one of the students in another class\nwon a local research prize.
So, please, don't give up on Kano-kun.
So, please. Accept me as a kindred spirit,\nand let us do whatever it takes to protect\nthis school!
So, ready for a final review? An order just\ncame in.
So, ready to dive in?
So, ready to serve with a smile?
So, see you here this afternoon, kid.\nI'll be waiting!
So, shall we head home as well, {NAME2}?
So, shall we head home as well?
So, since getting out of school, we've been\nat this for... two and a half hours? Really?\nIt's way earlier than I expected...
So, sugar, how are you finding the place?\nYou seem like you're having fun here.
So, that last strike wasn't enough... Then\nhow about this!?
So, that surprise...
So, that thing I wanted to ask... It's about\nthe Phantom Thieves.
So, that's why you targeted me?
So, the dam is drying up now that we've\nresolved those feelings in the real world?
So, the difference between them all\nboiled down to public reception. I'm not sure\nif I agree with that or not.
So, there shouldn't be any egregious messes.\nInstead, clean where you don't normally look.
So, there's actually been something I've\nwanted to ask for a while... Is that okay?
So, there's no goin' back, huh... You think\nsomebody's controllin' this thing?
So, these must be Kaneshiro's victims.
So, think you can learn by example by\nwatching me instead?
So, this is the last area, then...\nBetter steel ourselves for the last stretch!
So, this is the statue of that famous loyal\nhound.
So, to protect our school from the forces\nthreatening to devour it, and to fend off the\nboredom plaguing us gifted individuals\u2014
So, to summarize...
So, uh, you're probably wondering why I'm so insistent on talking to you.
So, uh, {NAME2}-kun... You've got time after\nthis, right?
So, uh... Do you think you'd be interested\nin coming to the movies with me again\nsometime?
So, um, could you tell us the number?
So, um, you see... I'm glad you could come\nwith me.
So, um... Follow us, okay? This way!
So, um... Sorry about last time. I was being\nselfish.
So, um... That's what I wanted to thank\nyou for.
So, um... You hold this part and\u2014 Whoa,\nit moved!
So, we believe the survival of the fittest\nidea explains how life changes form and\nnature.
So, we meet again.
So, we were trying to get somewhere,\nbut then...
So, we're back in the west building...
So, we're heading into the Metaverse to\ninfiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today, right?
So, we're in the kitchen today.
So, well... I'm having trouble deciding what\nto have for breakfast tomorrow.
So, what I'm trying to say is... He's my\ncoach!
So, what are we going to do food-wise?
So, what are we waiting for!? Let's get\nfarming!
So, what brings you in today?
So, what can I get you?
So, what did you think of my flair\nbartending?
So, what do you do in that case? Oh, wait.\nIf my theory is correct...
So, what do you say? You up for a few rounds?
So, what do you think? I say if we can get\nto the next area, let's give it a go.
So, what do you think? If you have any\ncomments or critiques, I'd love to hear...
So, what do you think? Should we investigate?
So, what do you want to do now?
So, what else do you eat besides\nfrankfurters?
So, what exactly are you doing, Skull?
So, what say all of you? Are you in favor of\nthe change of heart or not?
So, what should we plant first?
So, what would you like to eat, Motoha?
So, what you were saying at lunch, about how\nwe're supposed to change Kiuchi's heart...\nI think I got the gist of it, but...
So, what'll it be? The choice is yours. Take\nwhichever one you want.
So, what's the movie for today? If it's any\ngood, I'll drag my hubby along next time and\nmake him watch it!
So, what's the plan for today? I would like\nto check on Katayama's Palace, but...
So, what, a seasoned veteran can't\nhave opinions!?
So, when I started thinking I wanted to play\nbaseball too, my brother told me of the\nlegend that was Motoha Arai.
So, when I think about something happening\nagain because I said the wrong thing...
So, where do you two live? Do you do the uh, emailin'? No wait, textin'?
So, who's going to write the calling card?
So, why not give it a go with me,\n{NAME2}-kun?
So, will you let me have it? Or perhaps not?
So, without further delay... There is a\nparticular question I would like you\nto answer.
So, would that make you an elderly woman\nas well? Or perhaps some other sort of\nold bat. Hoohoohoo.
So, would you help me figure out what it is\nI want to do?
So, you have made another deeply intriguing decision.
So, you want us to defeat whatever is on\nthe other side then?
So, you work here as well.
So, you're here too, Wonder.
So, you're the ones who've been running\namuck through the church, then?
So, you're wrong. Its many dogs is\nthe correct answer.
So, you've chosen to face reality...\nWell then, I'm certain we'll meet again.
So, you've finally decided to snap out of it?
So, {NAME2}, have you ever\nhad a cr\xeape before?
So, {NAME2}, have you ever\nhad really high-end sushi?
So, {NAME2}-chan, do you have a favorite\u2014
So, {NAME2}-kun. Any cool ideas for the\ndrink?
So, {NAME2}... There's actually this\nramen shop I REALLY recommend!
So. Would you still come with me to my next\npart-time job?
So...
So... Are you doing anything after this?
So... Did something happen?
So... Do you think you can stick around for a\nlittle while longer?
So... Does that mean this is where we say\ngoodbye to Panther and the others?
So... How are we gonna get the dirt\non Mr. Akashi?
So... How was it?
So... I know this is going to sound too good\nto be true, but that guy came by to\napologize.
So... I was wondering if you wouldn't mind\ncoming with me to check it out?
So... I'm sorry for making you listen to my indecisive rambling. I'm done now.
So... Please come back to school soon!
So... There really is someone behind\nall this?
So... This is like... your pad?
So... Want to meet by that burger shop on\nCentral Street in Shibuya?
So... We just need to tell him to his face?
So... When you're meeting people at Station\nSquare, what kind of animal is the statue\nright in the center?
So... he turned himself in because we changed his heart?
So... sleepy...
So... that's how kids your age mingle?\nSounded complicated.
So... tired... Need... to sleep...
So... we were super busy yesterday, and now\nour inventory is a mess.
So... what am I doing?|No, I'll manage.
So... what can I get for you?
So... while we're on this topic, there's a\nnew drink I wanted you to try, {NAME2}-kun.
So... who is it? Somebody I know? Is it... a full-on crush?
So... you like booze?|You're drinking again...
So... you're the friend?|She's you in real life?
So...\nWe're meeting at a <color=#FF423F>caf\xe9</color>, right?
So? What do you think?
So? What'd you think?
Soccer's the most beloved sport in the world!\nThere's nothing like passing the ball at the\nperfect moment and scoring a goal!
Social media-worthy, huh? I've never given\nthat sorta stuff much thought.
Soft, fluffy potatoes infused with the rich\nflavor of the broth...
Softening the flavor helps it pair better\nwith the sweet bean jelly.
Solved it? That one wasn't really a puzzle!
Some Shadow in this vicinity\nmay be holding the key.
Some baseball shoes are\non display...
Some drink to spit up what's bottled up\ninside of them. Others drink to bottle\nthings up.
Some enemies have <color=#FF423F>weaknesses</color> you can\nexploit to knock them down.
Some guys she's never met showing up at her\nbedside? That'd probably terrify her, man.
Some kids today have the exact same problems\nI had back then.
Some new entity may have appeared.
Some of the documents I'll be working with\naren't meant to be seen by other teachers,\nso that will be a big help.
Some of the measures were hatched in sudden\nbursts of inspiration, so...
Some often take them for the latter meaning,\nso it's said they don't make for good\ngifts, but...
Some people also say "Stopper."
Some people are just awful.|I hope that gave her some comfort.|You've done your research.
Some people have taken pretty extreme\nmeasures to get labeled a Menace.
Some people said it was an accident, but\ngiven the circumstances, I have to think\nthat's what happened. You poor thing.
Some people say those syrups are actually\nall the same flavor, just different colors.
Some people think it's decided based on the\nnumber of comments and dislikes from users.
Some questions only work with a right triangle, right?
Some roles require a tall actor or a short\none, y'know?
Some stop eating when they find themselves\nbusy, while others eat more to relieve\nstress.
Some stuff happened, and we broke up...
Some things are worth protectin'... even if I've\ngotta lean on others. So, will you help me?
Some things just catch your eye! I understand!
Somebody finally came! I've been stuck\nhere forever...
Somebody has to solve the mysteries\nthreatening these halls before they can harm\nthe innocent.
Somebody, help!
Someday, you'll reach the age when your\naesthetic will also mature like fine wine.
Someday... even if it's just for fun...
Somehow the customers too... They always\nbreak out in a huge smile whenever they\neat it.
Somehow, I can't find the will to do either...
Somehow, I doubt that...
Somehow, I want to make sure Kotone-san hears\nall of the people rooting for her out there.
Somehow, it worked out...|Piece of cake.
Somehow, yes.
Someone get Tanemura-senpai. Something has\nto be done about them.
Someone must be feeding stray cats around\nhere, so they keep coming back. Not you,\nright? Ah well.
Someone picked up...
Someone should go with her...
Someone who leaves home to pursue a\ndream in this day and age... I really want to\nsupport him.
Someone who refuses to take anything I think\nor feel into consideration...
Someone who wouldn't hesitate to run in and save a person who needs help.
Someone who's always there to listen and\nhelp the students...
Someone! Help! That's the Subway Slammer!
Someone's already on it!
Someone's already sent it in for\n<color=#FF423F>Divine Justice</color>. Do you think Magatsukami will\ncondemn him as a Menace?
Someone's always getting in my way!
Someone's here!
Someone's in a good mood.|What're you singing?
Someone's not good at thinking on the spot...
Someone's... up on the roof?
Someplace else? Like where, the west\nbuilding?
Somethin' feels different about this room...
Somethin' smells. Must be your dirty rotten\nlies!
Something I always used to think when I came\nto this store as a customer...
Something I can help... Oh? That package...\nAre you the delivery person?
Something Mei and Hiroto like too would be good. What do you want to play?
Something about it is calming, though.\nIt really feels very "you" in here.
Something about that enemy seemed\nawfully familiar... But maybe it's my\nimagination?
Something about this area is extra disturbing.
Something about this place feels different.

Something came up that I need some advice on.\nDo you have a minute?
Something embarrassing.|A steamy couple.|A task no one wants to do.
Something feels different...
Something feels off about this. It's as if someone planned to make us watch that video.
Something feels off.|What do you want?
Something is very, very wrong.
Something isn't right... Let's go back to\nthat machine.
Something like that did happen...
Something like that... But actually...

Something seems to be out of order.
Something smells delicious...
Something smells good...

Something the matter?

Something weird's going on...
Something with a lot of laughs, and a little\nsomething heartwarming at the end.

Something's off with Ayaka...
Something's strange\nabout this...
Something's suspicious about that room...\nWon't you take a look, Wonder?
Sometime when you're free, let's go to\nInokashira Park!
Sometimes I feel like you've got me dancing\nin the palm of your hand...
Sometimes I have trouble reading Japanese...
Sometimes I see you talking to people and\nit's like, where are you even from?
Sometimes I think that working on the farm at\nmy parents' place wouldn't be so bad.
Sometimes a hand-written message conveys\none's feelings best, don't you think?
Sometimes bartending needs more oomph.\nThough I didn't mean for you to get a\nfirsthand taste of my practice...
Sometimes chowing down on some monja just\nreally hits the spot, y'know?
Sometimes he comes back home and brings me a\nlittle present.
Sometimes instead of pushing yourself, you\ngotta let go!
Sometimes it's good to spend some time\nalone... Why not just relax at home for a bit?
Sometimes people mistake me for someone\nrich when I tell them I live in Shibuya.
Sometimes there are problems of such\nmagnitude it takes the whole world working\ntogether to reach a solution.
Sometimes they go on sale at the drugstore,\nso I try to stock up then.
Sometimes when I stop to catch my breath I\nend up overhearing young people's\nconversations.
Sometimes when working on it, Ryoko's words\npop up in my mind and it gives me writer's\nblock...
Sometimes you can find restaurants where the\nsides are as popular as their signature dish.
Sometimes you have to throw up your hands and call the whole world crazy.
Sometimes, I come here when I'm feeling down.
Sometimes, I guess?|Just today.
Sometimes... Sometimes I think it would be\nnice if we could stay together like this.
Sometimes.|Not really.
Somewhere along the line, I became hooked\non playing the hot-blooded teacher.
Somewhere we could get some steps in would be\ngood too... Hmm, around Zoshigaya might do\nthe trick.
Somewhere your parents can't just barge in\nand make you clean up, you know?
Soon, he had his own merchandise!
Soon, the first automata block their path.
Sooner or later, you will certainly come\nto know them.
Sooo... I guess we could call it practice for\nstealing Kiuchi's Treasure or something?
Soooo hungry!
Sooorry! Apparently the ticket gate didn't like my train pass, so I got held up at the gate.
Sorry I didn't notice you earlier! I just can't ignore it when I see someone injured.
Sorry I made you watch all that.
Sorry I missed out on the first half of\nclub time.
Sorry I'm so late tonight, Minami-chan. We had sudden deadlines at work, so...
Sorry Yuma, can you wait till later to play with him?
Sorry about before... I was so disoriented I\ndidn't even say thank you.
Sorry about lunch.
Sorry about that.
Sorry about that. I ended up going on another\nheavy tangent...
Sorry about that. I haven't seen that kitty\nfor a while, so I had to...
Sorry about this... It looks like they got\nthe wrong idea when you showed up with me...
Sorry about today, Sensei.
Sorry but the movie's gonna start soon...\nI'll play with you next time, okay?
Sorry for asking out of the blue. It's really nothin'.
Sorry for asking such a weird question! Um,\nanyway! I'm looking forward to the tea party!
Sorry for being in such a hurry! I'll thank\nyou properly next time!
Sorry for being so frantic. Thanks for\nyour help!
Sorry for bothering you...
Sorry for callin' you little lady. I'll give you something special.
Sorry for calling you here so suddenly,\nbut I think you'd better give it a watch.
Sorry for calling you out of the blue. But I\nfigured you'd probably be willing to\nhelp me out.
Sorry for dragging you out with me.
Sorry for just dragging you into this. You\nreally were a lifesaver, uh...
Sorry for leaving you hanging with my last\nperformance. But today I'm giving it my all!
Sorry for making you come all the way here.\nYou really saved the day!
Sorry for making you wait! You could've said\nsomething earlier.
Sorry for stopping you. Thank you anyway.
Sorry for the extra work! I'll wait for\nyou here.
Sorry for the sudden question. Think of it\nas a routine work check-in.
Sorry for the sudden text. Do you have a\nsecond?
Sorry for the wait!
Sorry for the wait! I got some for everyone!
Sorry for the wait! I got the fertilizer!
Sorry for the yelling. That must have\nsurprised you.
Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable,\n{NAME1}...
Sorry if that sounds selfish.
Sorry if they sounded a little rude...\nI promise they're not usually like that.
Sorry to be a pain. Please, lead the way!
Sorry to bore you. I tend to get carried away at times.
Sorry to bother you, but do you have a\nsecond?
Sorry to bug you, but there's something I'd\nlike to talk about.
Sorry to burden you.
Sorry to burst your bubble here,\n{PLAYER_NAME}, but it'll send\nyou to an early grave.
Sorry to cause you trouble.
Sorry to disappoint you, but I am unable to fly in the Metaverse.
Sorry to drag you all the way out here to\nwatch me not hit a single frickin' ball.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch break. Could I\nspeak with you for a moment?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, teachers.\nI'm Yamanashi, the academic coordinator.
Sorry to interrupt.|Um...
Sorry to keep everyone waiting. Should we all\npractice together now?
Sorry to keep you all waiting\nafter inviting you out.
Sorry to keep you waitin'. I just made this\nin the home ec room. Give it a try.
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Sorry to keep you waiting, Motoha Arai.
Sorry to keep you waiting.|Hi there.
Sorry to keep you. Until next time.
Sorry to pull rank on you like that.
Sorry to put you on the spot, but here's a\nflower question for you.
Sorry to shatter your dreams, but... I highly\ndoubt it.
Sorry to spring this on you, but it's time\nfor a pop quiz!
Sorry to take over your lunch period.
Sorry to throw this at you out of the blue,\nbut it's important to me.
Sorry to throw you in the deep end.
Sorry to use such poetic language. I meant that you helped me with my troubles.
Sorry we're always calling you for the busy\nshifts.
Sorry you had to see all that. I shouldn't've gotten you involved.
Sorry! I didn't mean to start talking about something so heavy. Really, sorry, {NAME1}-kun.
Sorry! I misread the explanation! So then,\ncan I take from this? Wait, no...
Sorry, Cattle, but I won't believe this till\nI see it with my own two eyes.
Sorry, I forgot to ask where it was being held.
Sorry, I have a committee meeting today.
Sorry, I have to go! I hope to see you two at\nthe caf\xe9!
Sorry, I have to go. Stuff to do. See you.
Sorry, I mean they've added unique touches\nthat you'd only find at a diner.
Sorry, I need some more time to think...
Sorry, I need to get some air.
Sorry, I should be the one calling them,\nbut... The shop's way too busy. I'm counting\non you.
Sorry, I think you've got the wrong guy.\nIt smells good, though. Mmm yakitori...
Sorry, I went on a bit long there. This\nisn't anything you need to worry about.
Sorry, I'll give it some more thought. Thanks\nfor helping me with something so tough!
Sorry, I'm not sure either. But it's\nsomething we need to be wary of\ngoing forward.
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone...
Sorry, I've been busy. Wait... Did you want\nme to pressure you?
Sorry, Kumi-chan. The truth is...
Sorry, Kurosawa! You okay?
Sorry, Masa-san, I didn't mean to run off\nwithout cleaning up from the Food Fight...
Sorry, Shun-kun. Can't make a best picture without a few cuts.
Sorry, anyway, I called you here to pick up where we left off this morning...
Sorry, but I've gotta get an early start\ntomorrow, so I'm gonna head inside.
Sorry, but could you deliver it for me?\nThis must be important to her.
Sorry, but mine's higher priority! Yours\ndoesn't have the same "prospects," okay?
Sorry, but no.
Sorry, but there IS a prize for that field.\nThe answer is... math. Can you believe it?
Sorry, but you kind of still need those.\nThe answer is our pinky toes!
Sorry, can I ask your name? I'm\u2014wait, you\nknow already. Ayaka Sakai. I'm in college.
Sorry, could you speak up? I can't make out what you're saying.
Sorry, everything was so perfect that I got a\nsudden surge of energy!
Sorry, everything's just hitting me at\nonce...
Sorry, got a call...!
Sorry, he's a shy one.
Sorry, it just slipped out. I didn't mean it\nin a bad way though.
Sorry, just thinking out loud.
Sorry, let me explain. I can feel you growing\nmore suspicious as we speak.
Sorry, man. I called it.
Sorry, my thoughts are a mess right now...
Sorry, one sec.
Sorry, pal.
Sorry, partner! I was just talking to myself.
Sorry, pumpkin, but I ain't seen 'em today...
Sorry, thanks. I really appreciate it.
Sorry, that was my bad!
Sorry, that's not it.
Sorry, the real answer was his wealth.
Sorry, the rest is up to you.
Sorry, this won't take long!
Sorry, what were we even talking about again?
Sorry, what?|I might need a translator...
Sorry, you two. Shun's a great kid, but he's a bit shy when it comes to socializin'.
Sorry, {NAME1}! I didn't mean to put so much on your plate so suddenly.
Sorry, {NAME1}-kun! I was so deep in\nthought I wasn't looking where I was going.
Sorry, {NAME1}. That's no way for them to treat our newest member.
Sorry, {NAME2}-kun.
Sorry, {NAME2}.
Sorry, {NAME2}. I got in the zone. You see\nthis crater-lookin' space in the middle?
Sorry. Duty calls.
Sorry. Forget I mentioned it.
Sorry. I guess you didn't ask for my advice.
Sorry. I know class is already over, so I'll be quick.
Sorry. I know this has nothing to do with our\nsearch for my ideal flavors.
Sorry. I know this is totally coming out of\nnowhere...
Sorry. I saw you earlier, but I was in the\nmiddle of a song!
Sorry. I was just chasing the ball and...
Sorry. I've almost got it...
Sorry. My internal clock has been way out of\nwhack since everything got crazy with work.
Sorry. My schedule was packed with shifts\nlast week, so I didn't get to study much...
Sorry. Talking about the tournament's made me wanna get my body movin'!
Sorry. That was a weird thing to say. Just\nforget it.
Sorry. That was my office. They need me back.
Sorry. Truth be told, I really could use an\nextra pair of hands.
Sorry... I got a little dizzy, maybe from\nthe nerves.
Sorry... I guess I just made you listen to a\nwhole medley of sad songs...
Sorry... I just wanted to give you a ripped\nshoulder to lean on... How about we take\na break somewhere to\u2014
Sorry... It just felt like they were ignoring\nme and no one was listening...
Sorry... It's just I find I want to say a\nmillion things at once whenever I'm with\nyou, so... um...
Sorry... My legs are shot. Can't kick a ball straight.
Sorry... You're right.
Sort of tangential to that, there are many examples of thieves from that era who've come to be viewed as heroes.
Sort of.|Not entirely.
Sound good? I'll leave it to you, then.
Sounds a little like us, does it not? Hoohoo.
Sounds about right. This is the fashion\ndistrict, after all.
Sounds challenging.|It looks like a treasure map.
Sounds complicated.|Let's do our best.|You take the lead.
Sounds effective... and super embarrassing to\ndo alone!
Sounds fun.|I'm kinda busy.
Sounds good to me.|I actually have plans today...
Sounds good to me.|I've got nothing better to do.
Sounds good! Let's hit the locker rooms, then\nmeet back up!
Sounds good.|Let's hurry back.
Sounds good.|Might as well.
Sounds great! Care to join us, {NAME1}-kun?
Sounds great!|I'm not too hungry...
Sounds great!|Oh, we couldn't.|Let's get the lobster then.
Sounds illegal.|Can you sue?
Sounds like Ayaka wants to\nhave a jam session with me.\nI should head over...
Sounds like Ayaka wants to\nmeet up. I should head\nover now.
Sounds like I've been givin' you some real grief, Minami.
Sounds like Joker and Mona\nboth stay at Caf\xe9 Leblanc...
Sounds like Tomoko needs help\nwith something. I should head\nover now.
Sounds like Yumi wants to\nmake mocktails with me.\nI should head over...
Sounds like a great idea.|I'd love to try it.
Sounds like a great opportunity.|We have much more to talk about!|I'm sure it'll be enlightening.
Sounds like a plan. Maybe that'll help us\nfind out why Katayama-san ended up with a\nPalace in the first place, too.
Sounds like a plan.|Guess we have no choice...
Sounds like a plan.|Let's escape together.
Sounds like a plan.|Maybe when I'm less busy...
Sounds like a tough gig...
Sounds like amnesia.|Wow, that's nuts.
Sounds like it'll be a\nlong vacation...
Sounds like it. Guess he realized the "ninja\ntechniques" thing wasn't gonna cut it this time?
Sounds like our cue to split. See you again, Shun-kun.
Sounds like she's asking you out.|Maybe you should go alone?
Sounds like something might be\nweighing on Tomiyama's mind...
Sounds like they keep their backs to the\ncameras or stay in the blind spots.
Sounds like we're not the only intruders.
Sounds like what someone who\nlost something would say...
Sounds like you guys are close.|Known each other a long time?
Sounds like you had a crush on him.|You liked him a lot, huh?
Sounds like you really had it rough. You\ndon't need to talk about this if you don't\nwant to.
Sounds official. What are your names?
Sounds pretty cool when you put it like that, huh!? Like we're making the world a better place.
Sounds pretty hectic.|It was a good picture though...
Sounds pretty hot. My buddy told me he made\nover ten thousand yen in one go.
Sounds tough.|Give my regards to Yui.|Thanks for the burger.
Soup got in my eye!
Sour tonic...?
Soy it is.|Welcome to the team, Soy.
Soy's got this.|It's up to you!
Soy, do you happen to know her birthday?
Soy, hurry! Stick around and you'll end\nup a pancake!
Speak softly and\u2014
Speaking of -ing... I got curious and looked\ninto the word "wedding" recently.
Speaking of burgers...
Speaking of doctors, do you know about the clinic in Yongen?
Speaking of them, what're they like? Besides\nbeing Phantom Thieves.
Speaking of which, Hikaru Genji's romantic\nescapades are so well known and interesting!
Speaking of which, I decided to confess my\nfeelings to her since it was probably my\nlast chance...
Speaking of which, I haven't even introduced myself yet.
Speaking of which, could I ask you to\ncome along?
Speaking of which, there are some interesting\ndifferences between English and Japanese.
Speaking of which, we should be able to use\nthe Treasure we secured from him to\naid our search.
Speaking of, are you sure you don't want to share the news with Tomoko Noge?
Speaking of, here's a shot of me back when I\nwas young. And there's my hubby, of course!
Speaking of, we really need to stop Kiuchi as soon as possible. Before someone else gets hurt as badly as she did.
Speaking of, where is that girl? She still picking drinks?
Special lectures?|Class observations?|Cafeteria duty?
Special plan?|What does that mean?
Spectacular... That little carrot uncovered\nthe arson plot that threatened to divide\nPlantopia.
Speculatively! But yes, that is what I think.
Spend it all.|Money doesn't interest me.|It's all mine!
Spending time in a clean room feels good, don't you think?
Spending time with Ayaka,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Kurotani,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Lufel,\nI feel hope rising within me...
Spending time with Merope,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Motoha,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Shiina,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Shun,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Tomiyama,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Tomoko,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with Yaoling,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Spending time with animals has\ndeepened my <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
Spices were the reason Magellan gave when\nasked what motivated his reckless journey.
Spicy food always perks me up.
Spill it, feathers.|Meh, later's fine.
Spin and spin, the thread of fate...\nI am the mask which can see your past...
Splendid.
Splendidly done, Wonder! We've neutralized\nall the traps and security cameras now.
Spot the target and wait for a clear shot...\nPerhaps this can double as firearms training.
Spots like this aren't bad either, right? Come by again some time.
Spring sure is in the air! I can feel your\nyouthful exuberance from here!
Squats.|Sit-ups.|Wall sits.
Squee!
Squee...!
Stand up against injustice, huh?
Star-shaped ice cubes.|Colors like the night sky.
Stars are pretty cool, though.|Are you kidding? I love astronomy!
Start by targeting their weak points!
Start the engine and step on the gas. Then\nuse the wheel to steer.
Start with some shoulder stretches...\nYep, that feels good!
Start working out here now and you'll be\nthanking yourself for years to come!
Startin' with veggies is the way to go!\nYou really know what you're doin'.
Starting the Game Simulator. Follow the\ninstructions on screen to reenact the game.
Starting today, I'm all yours...
Status, fame, dreams, wishes, desires...
Stay alert, Wonder.
Stay alert.
Stay away from her.|......
Stay back! If you come any closer, I'll throw myself into the sea!
Stay back! If you come any closer, I'll throw myself overboard!
Stay calm now.|They don't seem hostile...
Stay calm! You can get\naway now!
Stay calm. They are just internet posts,\nso there's no way to know if they're real.\nThat said...
Stay focused! That'll have to wait!
Stay for a while|Keep walking
Stay on your guard.
Stay out of this, dumbass. We're talking to\nTake-chan.
Stay seated!
Stay sharp, everyone! Let's go!
Stay vigilant! I can sense his power\ngrowing by the second!
Stay vigilant, Wonder.
Stay with me, {NAME1}-kun...
Steady now. We just had a rather precarious encounter with those Shadows back in the Metaverse.
Steak, you say? Then I hope you'd invite\nme along!
Stealing the "Treasure" hidden within the palace.
Stealing?|So that's the job?
Step out forward a bit further!
Stepmom? Wait, are you seriously thinking of\nus as family for realsies!?
Stickin' to the basics, huh...?
Still, I can't help but think of a few things\nhere and there I would personally do\ndifferently...
Still, I can't tell a daisy from a dandelion!\nI could really use some help here...
Still, I could see you put thought into how\nto approach it.
Still, I don't know how long she can\nhold out. Let's take this chance to regroup!
Still, I feel like I have some\nmore <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> now...
Still, I really appreciate this.
Still, I respect the courage you displayed in\nthe face of insurmountable odds. It was a\nremarkable effort!
Still, I'd like to do anything I can to offer\nher some support.
Still, I'll take that over pity any day.
Still, I'm sure you'll manage.
Still, I'm worrying about this stuff with her\nmother even more than before.
Still, Katayama's Shadow left the Palace,\nand the real Katayama was saved.
Still, Shichi-kun is full of mysteries.
Still, a problem that escaped being answered\nfor that long... Doesn't it remind you of\nchasing some impossible dream?
Still, a verdict can't fix the damage done to\nKotone-san's heart.
Still, do not fall into complacency.
Still, having this card should grant us\naccess to further locations.
Still, if I get down on myself over something\nlike this, then what has my life been all\nabout!?
Still, if you're in Harajuku, it's gotta be\ncr\xeapes, right? I saw that on TV.
Still, isn't that a bit much? I don't think\nyou could possibly drink it all alone.
Still, it is very human of him to be pushed\nso off-topic by unrelated factors.
Still, it was very impressive.\nNo one would have doubted you for a second.
Still, it's likely finite. A steady offense\nshould eventually wear him down.
Still, it's the "how" I'm drawing a blank on.\nAny ideas, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun?
Still, nothing's happening to this Palace.
Still, ordering this quickly after we just\ngot set up? Maybe they're a regular. Or a\nhuge yakitori lover.
Still, organized knowledge is good for\nhelping you recollect things in an instant.
Still, she's gotten to the point where she\ncan tell me how she really feels straight up.
Still, thank you.
Still, thanks. That really broke the tension.\nI... I really think I can do it today.
Still, that stage crying was pretty intense.\nI think it's going to haunt my dreams...
Still, that was amazing! Going head-to-head with Kadota like that!
Still, that's no way for a mother to talk to\nher daughter! Not at all!
Still, the inconvenience is what creates\nmemories I guess. But now we can't share\nthat anymore...
Still, uh... socializing was the answer I was looking for.
Still, we can do that later.
Still, we mustn't panic. Stay calm and\nmemorize each one.
Still, we should head back to school. We\nleft our bags and everything there.
Still, what could have produced this\nmysterious hue?
Still, what you believe and what is true\nisn't always the same thing.
Still, why do you always stick by me, Sensei?\nYou're always here when I need you...
Still, working with countless customers has\nsharpened your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
Still, you get to do all sorts of cool stuff!\nHelping cats get adopted, things like that.
Still, your battle prowess was singularly\nimpressive, Shun Kano. I have great\nexpectations for your skills.
Still...
Still... Once I got into my exchange program,\nthe wind kinda fell outta my sails.
Still... She hasn't said anything about her\nrehab. And I'm not even sure how to ask.
Still... the Palace itself has likely\nchanged. Once we've made our preparations,\nlet's put our plan in motion.
Still.... I was shocked to hear about\nMs. Katayama's past. Did you know any of\nthat, Shun?
Stop Kurosawa!
Stop by again when you have time.
Stop by any time.
Stop it already, {NAME2}-chan! You're way\ntoo good at getting stories out of me!
Stop it! Please stop!
Stop it! You leave Shun alone!
Stop it, Cattle. Sorry about the little guy.\nHe doesn't know when to shut his beak\nsometimes.
Stop it, Mom.
Stop it...!
Stop recording at once, you two.
Stop resisting, Sensei!
Stop the intruder! Don't allow him to pass\nthrough!
Stop the livestream! Somebody get rid of this virus now!
Stop yelling.|Get back, Shiina-san.|Is this guy drunk?
Stop! Please!
Stop! You're the intruders, aren't you!?
Stop!|Don't bother her.
Stop!|Quit it!|Let her go!
Stop, Motoha.
Stories of his deeds were praised and passed along by the people, who even erected a statue in his honor.
Strange things, you say? Hmm...
Strange... The attack didn't hit...?
Strategic retreat!|Cattle, Vanish Ball!
Strawberry skewers, rainbow cotton candy...\nCHURROS!?
Strength, Upright
Strong desires? But I don't see anyone\naround here...
Strong medicine?|That's some shady clinic.
Strong? I dunno if I'd go that far...\nVersatile, maybe.
Students are chatting in\nfront of the Band Room...
Students need to be looked after at home\nand at school.
Studies, sports, friends, romance... There is\nmuch desire to be found.
Study is always beneficial, no matter the\nfield. That reminds me, there's a bookstore\nin Shibuya.
Studyin' someone else's cooking is the same\nas studyin' someone else's art.
Studying's important and all...
Studying.|Saving money.|Socializing.
Stuff like beach houses that only pop up\nfor one season and then disappear again.
Success!
Success. Accept this trophy as a mark of your\nvictory.
Such a frustrating display of injustice...\nIt makes you realize how difficult it was to\nfight against the prejudices of the era.
Such a narrow little space! How on Earth did\nthat cat hide it in there?
Such a nice sentiment, don't you think?
Such a thing was permitted under the\nancient system of polygamy. Hoohoo, are you\nperhaps feeling jealous?
Such extraordinary talent. You are the ideal\nidol that I seek.
Such high praise. Thanks for being so frank\nwith your feedback.
Such high praise. Why, thank you.
Such is the strange tale of the Evil AV Room\nwhere we stand now.
Such light footwork.|The outfit is beautiful.|You look like a pro.
Such mechanisms are both fun and useful\nto learn about, so keep your curiosity\npiqued!
Such people are hard to find by listening to\nthe voices from their Palace alone. We need\nmore intel.
Such tumultuous emotions... and yet, there's\na faint light, sinking deep within.
Suddenly finding myself in a strange place\nput me on high alert, and the next thing I\nknew, there was a stranger here...
Suggest the BLT cr\xeape|Suggest the peanut butter cr\xeape|Suggest the strawberry cr\xeape
Suggest the Japanese cr\xeape|Suggest the choco banana cr\xeape|Suggest the cream cheese cr\xeape
Suicide!?
Sumi-san is quite... unique.|You shouldn't listen to him.
Sumi-san...
Summer bonuses are around the corner, you know?
Summer's a battle against the heat!\nIt's really dangerous if you don't hydrate.
Sup...|Same as ever, I see.
Super courteous, that one. She may be younger\nthan me, but I respect the heck out of her.
Superb! Keep at it.
Support...?
Supposedly the clothes they display most\nprominently are the most trendy.
Sure I was "Mean Mitts Motoha" back in the\nday, but that's ancient history.
Sure am.|No thanks.
Sure is fun though.|Feels like we've all gotten close.
Sure is. Come by whenever you like.
Sure it's important to work hard, but I\nforgot how much I need to take breaks\nfrom it.
Sure people are talking about it, but she\nhasn't been officially condemned by\nMagatsukami or anything...
Sure thing! Though I'd prefer it if we could\neat them all here together.
Sure thing. See ya.
Sure thing.|I want to hear you next time.
Sure thing.|I'm actually in a hurry...
Sure thing.|I'm busy now, sorry...
Sure thing.|Maybe next time...
Sure was. I was certain that you were gonna\nstop by. Call it a hunch!
Sure with the white eggs and the white fish\nit looks a bit... white. But you know,\nit's more uniform that way!
Sure!
Sure! You see, this means...
Sure, I stopped playing for a bit, but I was\nable to hit Kiuchi's pitch at his Palace.
Sure, I tried. Couldn't solve a single\nproblem though!
Sure, I wasn't confident I could go pro, but\nI could've kept on dancing as a hobby.
Sure, I'll go with you.|Sorry, I've got plans...
Sure, I'll listen.|Maybe another time.
Sure, I'm free.|Sorry, I've got plans...
Sure, I'm glad the worst didn't happen... But what I really want is for her to be happy.
Sure, but still...
Sure, but that's kind of a scary thought...
Sure, but this area's crawling with Shadows.\nWe still gotta move carefully so\nwe're not spotted.
Sure, come over anytime.|It's a bit soon for that...
Sure, it'd be nice if that was true... but\nit's completely wrong. Money is the answer.
Sure, it's easy to say that, but what if we lose!?
Sure, let's do this.|Not yet...
Sure, my treat.|Your treat!
Sure, no worries! Sorry for the last-minute\ninvitation.
Sure, she's pretty good, but\u2014
Sure, there's a tiny bit of luck involved...\nBut if you just keep trying, you're\nguaranteed to win.
Sure, traditional Japanese food steeped in\nhistory is also great...
Sure. I'm not cool with stayin' still, but\nI'm game as long as I can move.
Sure. Just don't come home too late!
Sure. What is it?
Sure. Ya don't gotta decide right away.\nJust think about it if you're interested.
Sure.|I can't...
Sure.|I guess I've got no choice.
Sure.|I have other plans...
Sure.|Let's do it!
Sure.|Let's do it.
Sure.|No thanks.
Sure.|Not just yet.
Sure.|Not right now...
Sure.|Now's not a good time...
Sure.|Only if you teach me math.
Sure.|Probably not.
Sure.|Sorry, I won't be in the area...
Sure.|Sorry, I'm kinda busy...
Surely that one's too pale? They asked for\nsomething vivid. Let's choose something else.
Surely the action you take to uncover the\ntruth will bring your desire to new heights.
Surely, they're called potato moles for a\nreason, right!?
Surprise? Here at the school? I wonder what\nit is.
Surprised? Don't worry, we didn't compromise\non flavor!
Sushi is bit high-end, but if I had a\nkitchen, I'd try. Can you arrange for one?
Sushi? Yes please.|I can't wait.
Swan... Yay?
Sweet deal, right? When I heard that,\nI brought along all my cash to try it out\nfor myself.
Sweet dreams... I look forward to our\nnext meeting.
Sweet osmanthus.|Japanese anemone.|Jasmine.
Sweet potatoes, maybe?|How about zucchini?|Melon is king.
Sweet!
Swindle... me? What do you mean?
Symbols, huh...? Wasn't there something like\nthat on the monitor earlier?
T-Thanks. I don't really get gifts, so...\nIt means a lot.
T-The details are on this flyer! Have a\nnice day!
T-There...!
T-Time out for a sec! Let's save that for\nanother time, okay?
T-Traitor!
THIS is the Treasure!?
Tada! It's a protein shake!
Taiko is fine for now. I was able to find out\nwhat she's so hung up on...
Taiko's played in a band since middle school,\nso she's pretty skilled.
Takamaki has a Persona, too!?
Takamaki-san!
Takamaki-san?
Takamakiiiii!
Takanashi should rewrite it.|Do you remember the melody, Takanashi?
Takanashi, don't talk me up like that.\nYou know how I break under pressure.
Take "fate" and "destiny," for example.
Take 'em down, Joker!
Take 17th century Europe, for example. Even\nthough liberal ideas had taken root, there\nwere still problems with human rights.
Take Ignaz Semmelweis for example,\nan incredible eighteenth-century doctor!
Take a blue marble.|Take an old coin.|Take a silver ring.
Take a gander at those high-heeled shoes. It must take strict training to be able to walk in them...
Take a listen to this.
Take a look around, Wonder.
Take a look at it, Wonder.
Take a look.|Maybe later.
Take a red button.|Take a toy necklace.|Take a gold ring.
Take care not to be discovered.
Take care not to break any of the bowls.
Take care not to trip.
Take care now.
Take care of the dining area, would you?
Take care, dear.
Take care.
Take customers' orders, prep them,\nserve them, ring them up, and then\nclean the store.
Take good care of it, okay?
Take it away, Soy.|Fox, you're up.|Queen, the floor is yours.
Take it down a notch.|You're going way too hard.
Take it.
Take my desires, you say? Don't make\nme laugh!
Take some time to prepare before we\nengage in combat.
Take some time to think it over.
Take that back!
Take that!
Take the blue pill, and continue believing\nwhatever you want to believe.
Take the lead, Wonder.
Take the red capsule, and you can see\nreality for what it truly is.
Take these. One for last time, and one for today.
Take us home, Closer.
Take your time.|Just tell me what you want...
Take, for example, the storybook way\nto get rich quick: buried treasure.
Take-chan...
Take-kun!
Take-kun's words hit me hard.
Take-kun. Do you have a minute?
Take-kun...
Take-kun?
Takemi Medical Clinic... Here it is.
Takemi Medical Clinic\nin Yongen-Jaya...
Taken by the aroma, I close\nmy eyes...
Takeout's delicious even when cold. It\nreminds me of the packed lunches my mom\nwould make...
Takeyuki Kiuchi is a former baseball player.
Taking an alternative entrance feels much more suited to us Phantom Thieves.
Taking on different roles... You could say\nit's similar to the power of Persona, no?
Taking orders, washing dishes, or perhaps\nmaking curry...
Talk about a city that never sleeps...
Talk about a full-course crime... Oh yeah,\nhe was condemned as a Menace, wasn't he?
Talk about avoiding the subject...
Talk to her|Keep walking
Talk to him|Avoid him
Talk to you later then. Living alone can't be\neasy, but make sure to eat well!
Talk to you then! See ya!
Talking about it is making me crave a cup.\nHow about we go grab one later?
Talking about this kinda makes me wanna go\nback there. Should we go after this?
Talking down to me like you know best...
Talking to a kid in a school uniform makes me\nfeel like I'm back in school too.
Tamayo has always worked super hard, right?
Tamayo... She's amazing!
Tamayo... Yoshida... Tamayo... Tamayo... Ah!
Tanemura-kun... Go home for today! And tell\nno one about this! Got it!?
Tanemura-san is already struggling with her\nresponsibilities to her family!
Tanemura-san!? Disciplinary committee aside,\nshe's just a student!
Tanemura-san, I'm glad you're here.
Tanemura-san, wanna walk home together?
Tanemura-san...
Tanemura-san... Why are you here?
Tanemura-san...?
Tanemura-san?
Tanemura-senpai just spoke to us!
Tanemura-senpai, is it true you were there\nwhen it went down?
Tanemura...\nAh yes, heiress to the Umetane company.
Tanzo looks so happy when he\ntalks about yakitori...
Tanzo prepared the yakitori\nwith an effortless dexterity...
Tanzo-san, do you do offer yakitori delivery\nby chance?
Tanzou continues calling out\nto passersby...
Tanzou seems intensely\npassionate about yakitori...
Target the enemy's <color=#FF423F>weakness</color> to take\ncontrol of the battle.
Target those first! Once they're gone,\nwe can <color=#FF423F>limit Miyazawa's movement</color>.
Target?|What are you talking about?
Tch!
Tch! But now he's seen us. We should get out of here.
Tch! Get ready, Wonder. Here they come!
Tch! She's been captured!
Tch, Shadows are starting to close in on us.
Tch, didn't fall for it, huh? Yes,\nthe correct answer is Mrs. Marie Curie.
Tch, how the heck did you know that? Yes,\nit was exercise to train the body and mind.
Tch, look who's clever today. That's right,\nyou'd split it with the landowner.
Tch, now we're surrounded. This is bad!
Tch, you're right. It's obvious enough when\nyou consider which has the least cash value.
Tch, you're utterly useless! That person's\npower turned out to be a disappointment, too...
Tch.
Tch. Seems like a waste of time to me. But\nif it'll lift your suspicion, then whatever\nfloats your boat, Lufel.
Tch...
Tch... How dare you try to upstage the main\ncharacter! You damn bit players!
Tch... Hurry it up!
Tch... Okay...
Tch... So you already knew.\nIndeed, there is no contradiction.
Tch... The Shadows spotted us! Everyone,\nget ready!
Tch... There's a Shadow guarding that\ntreasure chest...
Tch... There's no way to fight back with\nthis net in the way!
Tch... They have us surrounded! There's\ntoo many. We must retreat at once...
Tch... This is bad!
Tch... You really are a cheeky one.
Tch... You're right. The correct answer is\nLouis Mandrin.
Tch... You're unexpectedly encyclopedic.\nYes, the answer is Artemisia Gentileschi.
Tch...!
Team Weird Critters!?
Team members who have finished their core\nexercises, proceed to the next exercise.
Team treadmill.|I need fresh air on my face.
Teamwork makes the dream work.|I like lone heroes.
Teeheehee!
Teeheehee! My mom said the same thing!
Teeth are tough, but you have to take good care of them!
Tell him to watch where he's going|Lend the girl a hand
Tell me what happened.|Why weren't you able to sleep?
Tell me why this film was so important\nto you.
Tell me, do present day humans no longer use\nsuch words? It would appear I must make\namendments to my body of knowledge.
Tell me, {NAME1}-kun. I don't mean to burden you with all this but...
Tell the truth about everything that\nhappened... Seriously reflect on your\nactions, and atone for your crimes...
Temperance, Upright
Ten million.|One hundred million.|One billion.
Tending to the plants in the garden?
Test failed. Such poor performance is\nunacceptable before the great Kiuchi-sama.
Text-only posts are easy to miss. Image and\nvideo posts are just more attention-grabbing.
Th-Thank you!
Th-Thank you! Even if you're just being nice,\nI appreciate it.
Th-Thanks!
Th-This ain't my fault!
Th-This can't be happening!
Th-This is...!

Thank goodness. We can finally resume our\nstrategic meeting. So, as I was saying...
Thank goodness...

Thanks to her, he'll never...
Thanks to my parents.|Nope.|I guess a little.
Thanks to my slipup, Victory Kitchen's become\nMiyazawa's punching bag. With all his bad\nreviews circulating...
Thanks to that, we can't get out of here,\nand we can't do our jobs at the <color=#FF423F>Water\nTreatment Plant</color>.

Thanks, dude! Here, you can take this!
Thanks, everything looks spotless!

Thanks. You and Lufel were great too!
Thanks. You know me. I always aim to please.
Thanks...
Thanks... Gettin' Serizawa's approval means\nthe world to me!
Thanks... I feel a bit better hearing you\nsay that.
Thanks... It makes me really happy to hear\nyou say that.
Thanks... That's helped me perk up a little,\nat least...
Thanks... You're very kind.
Thanks.\nI'll try doing that from now on.
Thanks.|You're making me blush.
That "hubby" fellow she's always talking about...
That <color=#FF423F>important book</color> is ours for the taking!
That <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color>... is terrifying... I'm\njust going to hide here! I'm not opening\nthat door for anything!
That <color=#FF423F>projector</color> is suspicious.\nThere must be trick to it.
That DVD I just watched of\n"The Ghost" really had\nme spooked...
That Heritage Kitchen shop I tore to shreds today in Zoshigaya is the parent store to Victory Kitchen...
That I did. Simply put, I wish to employ\nyour abilities.
That I do not know.
That I love singing and that sharing my\nfeelings through song makes me happy?
That Kano guy... could he be...
That Kiuchi guy, or whatever his name was... I've actually been shoved by him before.
That Motoha... If this were the Metaverse we'd be up to our beaks in enemies right now.
That Narumi girl stirs such strong emotions\nwithin me... Just what is this feeling?
That Shadow appears quite powerful... But we'll need to defeat it to proceed.
That Shadow healed itself completely.\nIs it invincible?
That Shadow looks powerful. We should\nmake sure we're prepared to fight it.
That Shadow over there...
That Shadow seems pretty tough...
That TV anchor lady's here to interview me.\nIf I don't impress her, it'll ruin my image!
That Universe-sized Ramen is our biggest\nsize, so we don't have any greater challenge\nto offer you...
That adaptability to unexpected situations\nshows <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color> we should strive\nto emulate ourselves.
That after-school feeling is the best, huh?\nMan, I kinda miss being in high school...
That alarm indicates that the time for your\nattendance at school is drawing closer, yes?
That appears to be from the early days of his downward spiral.
That appears to be the case. We have no\nchoice but to find another way to escape.
That appears to be the general consensus\namong today's generation. However, you are no\nordinary teenager.
That area doesn't have too many cars, so\nit's a nice place to go running...
That asshole! Are you kiddin' me!?
That asshole...
That bastard is still stealing energy from\nKatayama-san... You're done!
That bastard!
That bastard... Just thinking about it\npisses me off!
That battle likely caught the attention of other enemies nearby. We had better hurry.
That being is probably not Akashi's Shadow.\nI hypothesize that it may be a cognitive form\nborn from Katayama's mind.
That being said, I've also made a lot of\nmistakes when I'm drunk...
That being said, the state of your room\nleaves much to be desired.
That big banner hanging there looks new\nto me too.
That bold use of seasoning seems to have\npaid off.
That box... It can't be!
That cat there's <color=#FF423F>Mona</color>.
That comes out to about 16 poems a minute.\nIsn't that crazy? I'm flabbergasted myself!
That complicates things... There must be a\nswitch to deactivate it somewhere.
That concludes our time here for now.
That contract to give away the shop... I don't\neven remember signing it... But he has it now,\nso I guess there's nothin' I can do...
That could work! Once they're ready, we could\nroast them together, too... Hehe, that sounds fun.
That cowardly crap just pisses me off.\nIf you're gonna talk shit, say it to the\nperson's face.
That customer over there. Does he look a bit\nsuspicious to you?
That day, all three of you skipped afternoon\nclasses and came back to school together.
That designer is super talented! Anyone who's\nin the know has heard of them.
That didn't work...
That didn't work... Why don't we reconsider\nthe pattern here and try again?
That difference strikes me as something very\nimportant in and of itself.
That does mean things change so fast here,\nthough. I wonder if any of the shops I know\nare still around.
That does seem likely. Let's try taking\nout the guards!
That does simplify matters.
That does sound nice... but a place like\nthat's gonna be super hard to find.
That doesn't sound good.|Did something happen?
That enemy just now, though... It was like\nMadarame but different. What was it?
That explains it.
That explains that...
That explains the outage. Anyway, let's head\nafter Aka-shit.
That explains why he looks familiar! I must\nhave seen him around the area if he's local.
That face... That voice... You're just like\nKiuchi... but how!?
That fact... is ever constant.
That feeling of leaving everything up to\nchance, letting the whims of fate take hold\nof your life...
That feeling of striving to obtain the solution you desire...
That figure skater wore it in her off time.
That flower lacks a strong aroma.\nLet's choose another.
That form... I can feel it... Its radiant, bursting zeal for life!
That friend of yours does not appear to be\nonline today...
That fuckin' scumbag! Way to bring\nchickenshit to a new level!
That game's rigged.|There's no way to win that.
That girl over there, that's Kotone Montagne,\nright? The figure skater!
That girl who was sitting here during lunch was so cute, right!?
That girl's actually pretty good.
That girl's right. This puzzle\nisn't written correctly...
That girl... It appears she is able to sense the Metaverse.
That girl... There's nothing\nI can do to save her...
That goalkeeper is more than you can handle\nat present. Better practice more and\ntry again.
That goes for the rest of you too. Now get\nback to work, everyone.
That goes for you too, {NAME2}-chan.\nNo shying out from dinner now!
That goes without saying.
That got me thinking, the next place I want\nto go is\u2014
That guy annoyed us, but we were too afraid\nto stand up to him.
That guy over there...
That guy who pushed Tomoko... You spoke to him in Shibuya the other day, didn't you?
That guy's twisted view really shows in this\nplace.
That guy... It's almost like he's with someone even though he's alone...
That horse I've had my eye on, she's\ndefinitely going to win today.
That how you wanna play it?
That huge statue sure does get your attention. Don't ya think it's a li'l suspicious?
That idiot!
That is all for this evening.
That is all. Thank you for your continued\ncooperation.
That is correct.
That is correct. Furthermore, Closer is still not used to combat.
That is correct. Let's start by listening to\nthe collective unconscious of this area.
That is enough, ruffian.
That is likely when your potential desire\nbloomed and your Persona partially awakened.
That is my guiding belief.
That is one possibility... But something\noccurred to me as Lufel spoke just now.
That is our target. <color=#FF423F>Takeyuki Kiuchi</color>.
That is sufficient. Manga is a very popular\nform of amusement in the modern day.
That is to say, at present, people cannot\neven imagine the existence of hope in\ntheir world.
That is true. Wonder, let's go to the control\nroom first.
That is why I have borrowed the kitchen here\nat Victory Kitchen for our battle today!
That is why interaction with others is so meaningful.
That is wonderful. Please lay bare those\ndesires.
That is, the Shadows of this Palace are distinct from those inside Mementos.
That it does, {NAME1}-san. I'm on my\nguard too.
That it is. You rats are hereby sentenced to\ndeath. For the crime of obstruction, you\nshall all face execution.
That jingle-jangle sound... It's irr-hee-sistable, ho!
That just means we'll have to find this other\nCore.
That just proves how hard you've worked.
That just shows how important it is. I bet\nwe can make it underground if we take it.
That kid is playing\nby himself...
That leaves me.|I guess I'll have to.
That lever is terribly suspicious...
That little excerpt was from "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter" and is personally my favorite scene.
That looks fun.|What are you doing?|Is that a bazooka?
That looks like the kinda guy that'd be\nguarding the Core.
That looks nothing like what we took from the Palace.
That made it easy to gather information on his Palace quickly.
That makes it sound like the friend\nabandoned her! That's no good.
That makes me the senior staff today!
That makes sense I guess.|You seem very eager about this.
That makes sense! There are lots of shops\naround here!
That makes way more sense! I can't picture\nMs. Katayama being controlled by anyone!
That man standing next to\nher must be her boss.
That man's acting suspicious.
That manager seems as lackadaisical as\never... Do you remember the explanation?\nSeems that's all you'll get.
That mark isn't\nglowing anymore...
That mascot thing?|I think I've seen it.
That mask...!
That may be difficult...
That may be so, but I'm not proposing this\nwithout good reason.
That may be so, but if we want to get\nthat second <color=#FF423F>chain</color>, we have no choice\nbut to enter.
That may be the case, but I'm simply stating\nthe facts of the matter.
That may have worked before, but who knows\nwhether it'll work this time?
That means I get to show you why they call me\nthe ace of the newspaper club!
That means even a toy gun has the potential to be a deadly weapon.
That means even you have a chance of winning. So, Shun-kun. How about it? Are you in?
That means fighting with guns will give us\nthe advantage!
That means it's juice time! What flavor does\neveryone want?
That means the flavor of our food\nchanges on the daily.
That means there's no risk of it crashing\nlike with a plane or a helicopter.
That means they can't get too fat or too\nskinny, since they all wear the same suits.
That means this is a safe place for us...\nA <color=#FF423F>Safe Room</color>, if you will.
That means we've stopped his Shadow's frenzy. He doesn't have the power to resist anymore.
That means wind sprints!
That means you can try out winter sports like\nskiing and snowboarding.
That means you two are...
That might be a bad example, though.\nI imagine most of you would enjoy\npublic executions too.
That might be true, but it's not like they're better than us. We can beat them!
That might be true, but... wouldn't you want\nto help if you were me?
That might make things easier for me...
That miso smells\nreally good...
That moment of bliss when you bite into\none of these juicy masterpieces is simply\nsublime!
That money would normally be included in\nour wages.
That much I can say for certain...
That music teacher also taught me a bit\nabout composition.
That must have been back when\nMotoha still admired Kiuchi...
That must have been quite trying for you all.
That must have been scary. Are you all right,\nTanemura-san?
That must have been the final\nelectrical box.
That must mean you perceived me\nspeaking in the Metaverse...
That must've been it.|I think so?
That must've been scary for you. He looked\nready to snap at any moment.
That other time, when I uploaded the photo\nand caused all that outrage, it was a real\ndisaster.
That oughta force ol' Pops to hand the rights to Victory Kitchen over to me.
That painting's huge... Think we can get\nthrough this one, too?
That perfect combination of sweet and salty\nstarch is irresistible!
That perfectly crispy tonkatsu, or a\nmouthwateringly juicy steak...
That person has been using the Metaverse as\na means to exploit the desires of others.\nAnd I am intent on catching them.
That person would often be Motoha. We'd check\nout the bookstore, go see a movie...
That place's full of cute clothes!
That puts all three books in our possession.
That reaction from Kamoshida...
That recipe you taught me...|Making mocktails is fun.
That red light... This is bad! Her wrath has\nreached its peak! Everyone, get ready!
That refers to a pair of numbers whose\ndivisors can be summed up to the other\nnumber.
That reminds me, you two are in Kumi-chan's\nclass, aren't ya?
That reminds me...
That restaurant in Shibuya you recommended was great!
That rings a bell...|Maybe sort of...
That room totally had "we're hiding something\nsuper important in here!" kinda vibes.
That round hole in the middle... Something\nprobably goes in there.
That rumor spread quickly. Maybe too\nquickly...
That said, I really don't know much about\nwhat's hot and what's not...
That said, I'm not saying that fashion no\nlonger matters once you get older.
That said, all this talk about plums has left\nme with a sour taste in my mouth...
That said, its flavor was heavily inspired by\nthe ramen at Heritage Kitchen.
That said, just what kind of topic would\nbe best?
That said, learning it as your second\nlanguage puts you at a bit of a disadvantage.
That said, perhaps I upset him somehow\nwithout realizing it.
That said, saving our plot\nfrom pests would surely\nstrengthen my bond with Yui...
That said, there are still rules when it\ncomes to merging and dropping sounds.\nIt's not just random.
That said, this isn't really what I was\nlooking for this time.
That said... it doesn't feel right to come\nto a monjayaki restaurant and not order\nmonjayaki.
That seems just right.|What a lovely contrast.
That seems likely.|How is that possible!?
That seems quite likely.\nLet us time our movements precisely\nfor when they are turned off.
That seems to be its way of thanking you for\nthe cat food. In that case, we humbly accept.
That seems to have gone well.
That seems to have gone well. I imagine\nthere are other similar devices.
That seems to have opened the path.
That settles it then.
That settles it. We're counting on you!
That shall be all for today. I hope our\nspecial contract proves fruitful.
That shallow goal led me to ignore the people\nin my life and my own feelings.
That shape... It could only be a large\npiggy bank. How fascinating...
That shape... It could only be an enormous\npiggy bank. How fascinating...
That short-haired girl...
That should boost the health of her muscles\ndramatically. Problem solved!
That should cover plant classification.\nWait until we get to animals, though.\nThey're way more complicated!
That should have neutralized the fence.
That should work. We can use the fan's\nkinetic energy. Very observant, Wonder.
That shouldn't be too hard to pull off!
That sign says, "Open Set."
That smells really good. I'm pretty peckish\nright now, too.
That so? And what'd she tell you?
That so? Okay...
That sort of stuff is too fiddly for me.\nGuess you could say I'm kinda jealous!
That sounded like an\nexplosion. I should\ngo check it out.
That sounds like a nice plan and all...
That sounds like even more trouble than a regular part-time job...
That sounds like something out of a comic\nbook. Did you know that when you said it?
That sounds tough.|......
That sounds tough.|I don't know about funny...|That's just the way it goes.
That spike was amazing!
That store sells needles for vinyl record\nplayers...
That strange power which transformed her is\ngone, and she's no longer in a frenzy.
That strength must be what inspired me back\nthen. I remember now...
That student has excessive absences and\nfrequently leaves school early.
That student is more reliable than you are!
That sums everythin' ya need to know about\nit. Now all that's left is to try it\nfor yourself!
That sure was a lotta work for\nthree shabby books...
That ten thousand yen from my parents was\ngone before I knew it. I've started working\npart-time now...
That these roads are still in use after 2000\nyears is a testament to their durability.
That they've welcomed us as their\nchallengers with open arms.
That thing Closer spotted may be a hint. We\nshould at least take a closer look.
That thing about Miyazawa has gone viral, huh.
That time, I thought I could sense potential\nfor hope coming from...
That took forever! Let's get back to the\ncooling facility.
That took guts.|That's the least he can do.
That treasure chest... Something about it\nseems unusual.
That uniform... Is that for Kokatsu Academy?
That video... Was that from a baseball clinic Kiuchi taught when he was still a professional player?
That voice inside me, the screams from my\nmuscles... My body was trying to tell me what\nto do, but I couldn't hear any of it.
That voice...
That voice... Cattle?
That voice... Let's go!
That voice... Sakamoto!?
That was Kamoshida.
That was a challenging task, but you passed\nwith flying colors.
That was a close one though. I could have been seriously hurt. Be more careful, all right?
That was a close one! Looks like my plan worked out.
That was a close one...
That was a very moving story. Although\na few parts were a bit heavy-handed.
That was a warning screech! It means I'm\nfurious with you!
That was absolutely delicious.
That was amazing, Motoha!
That was bad... Everyone all right?
That was certainly a duplicitous problem,\nbut I'll let it slide for the knowledge it\nprovided.
That was excellent! Is this really your\nfirst time?
That was exhausting...
That was footage of the lighter incident,\nwasn't it?
That was fun. Thank you for coming with me.
That was harsh.|He's had a lot on his mind.|Did he strike a nerve?
That was helpful, right?
That was just my impression. Sounds pretty\ndeep when you think about it, right?
That was kind of heavy, huh?
That was my first time riding one of those!\nIt was exhilarating to say the least!
That was nice. I guess I\nshould start heading home...
That was probably around the time I first\nheard about her.
That was quite the coup de grace. Your skill in battle's left me flabbergasted.
That was quite the difficult session. Let's\nstop there for today.
That was really good. Well, the few bites we managed to have were. No wonder Miyazawa gave this place such a great review.
That was so unnatural...
That was sooo good! I enjoyed that with my whole heart and soul.
That was surprising.|You can't blame her.
That was the one I sang now. It's an original\nour band wrote together.
That was totes awesome! I didn't know you did\nsongs like that too, Ayaka-san!
That was what I performed at the competition.
That was... something.|Maybe use some more emotion?
That way's too dangerous.\nLet's leave it for now.
That way, maybe Motoha can love baseball again... and smile with her whole heart like she did back then.
That way, the Shadows will be able to return\nto their human selves.
That we are! But I think we should all\nkeep the details of our operations\nto ourselves.
That weird Shadow from earlier... Was that\nsupposed to be Ms. Katayama's Shadow?
That went well!
That went well! Keep it up, Wonder!
That western-style restaurant in Yotsuya\nhas really gone downhill. Awful sauces.
That will be all for this trial.
That will be all. I appreciate your continued\ncooperation.
That will get you nowhere. Try the other escalator instead.
That woman... She was far scarier than the\nmafia boss, wouldn't you agree?
That won't be necessary.
That won't do. An empty wallet's bound to hinder our work as Phantom Thieves.
That would be a lot of work.|No one has the time?
That would be enough for me, and I think it\ncould be a particularly invigorating\nexperience.
That would be extremely dangerous. Let's do\nthis carefully.
That would be great!|I couldn't ask you to do that...
That would be hurtful coming from anyone\nbut you, Soy.
That would be nice if true.
That would be pretty fun, huh?
That would imply a deep trust between them.\nOr perhaps, dependency?
That wouldn't completely satisfy the\ncustomer's request.
That'd be a big help.|I take full responsibility.
That'd be great! You could get your\nbass and...
That'd be nice! How 'bout we take\na little break and then go back to check?
That'd be nice. Maybe I could show you\nhow to make curry, too.
That'd be okay, right?
That'll be 1,024 yen, ma'am.|Other customers are waiting, ma'am.
That'll be 1,200 yen.|That'll be 1,060 yen.|That'll be 2,887 yen.
That'll be 1,250 yen.|That'll be 2,500 yen.|That'll be 100 yen.
That'll be 181 yen! Do you need a bag?
That'll be 800 yen.|That'll be 1,320 yen.|It's on the house.
That's Kiuchi"-sama" to you!
That's Master Madarame for ya!
That's Master Madarame for you!
That's Miyazawa's...
That's Ms. Katayama's Treasure!
That's Ms. Katayama's class, isn't it?
That's Ogiwara's Shadow...
That's a <color=#FF423F>Depraved Shadow</color>.\nDefeat it, and you'll get <color=#FF423F>something good</color>.
That's a bit far.|He's been to Yongen-Jaya?
That's a good point...
That's a good way to look at it. Just to warn\nyou, it'd be a real mood-killer if you fell\nasleep too.
That's a great dream.|I'm rooting for you.
That's a great idea! I knew I could count on\nyou, Sensei.
That's a great idea!|Let's do it!
That's a great idea.|It's perfect!
That's a huge help, thank you!
That's a little melodramatic.|I never thought of it that way.
That's a lot of enemies...\nLooks like I'll have to\nface them alone!
That's a lot of food.|Sounds high-calorie.|Talk about raising the "steaks"!
That's a new one...|You really want to know?|Let's roll the dice.
That's a nice story.|Yamagoshi-san's a great guy.
That's a poem I adore. It means what you\ngain from study and books is\nincredibly valuable.
That's a pretty big downside.|Must lead to tons of false rumors.
That's a pretty goofy walk you got going on there...
That's a promise, okay? You can't take it\nback now\u2014never ever!
That's a relief. Thanks. Let's go meet her\nright away.
That's a relief... Haha...
That's a relief.|I was a bit nervous about that.|I was looking forward to that...
That's a scary thought...
That's a shame... Let's give it another shot\nwhen our schedules line up.
That's a ticket for a picture with me at my\nnext photo session!
That's a tough one to answer.
That's a valid point. Although I'd prefer it\nto actually taste delicious as well.
That's a wrap, people! Good work today!
That's actually what I wanted to call\nyou about.
That's all I have to say for now.
That's all I wanted to say. Anyway...\nExcuse me.
That's all for our ground coverage from the baseball training infield.
That's all for today! Great job, everyone!
That's all for today's assembly!
That's all for tonight's Stupidly Honest\nReview with Miyazawa-kun, where I tell ya the\nwho's who and what's what in food biz.
That's all of us. Let's get to Kichijoji.
That's all right, I'll call a car. Thank you,\nMotoha.
That's all the anniversary albums here...
That's all the announcements for today.\nOh, one more thing.
That's all the box mazes solved... Let's move\nforward.
That's all the information we have to offer\non the subject. Now allow me to ask you\na question...
That's all the orders. Now we only need to\nmake and serve them.
That's all the shields we need!
That's all, really.
That's all.
That's all. Class dismissed.
That's always been my form of stress relief.\nWhen I hit those pedals, I can\nforget everything.
That's amazing.|Good luck!
That's an interesting way to look at the phrase...
That's ancient history.
That's because I personally believe doing so\nis for the best.
That's because he stole\nfrom the oppressive rich...
That's because there's a fee for our services\nincluded in the price.
That's bullshit!
That's called being a fan.|Guess you're her fan now.
That's cool! Holler at me when you've\ngot time!
That's customer consideration for you... You\nget so much outta a single bowl.
That's deep...|Talk about confusing.
That's deep.|What's the point?|You just want to order more.
That's definitely Katayama, right?
That's definitely a clue from Joker! He must\nbe up ahead now.
That's enough alre\u2014!
That's enough from you. Let's move out\nalready.
That's enough staring... It is time I become\nyour mask and teach you my joy-bringing\ndance...
That's enough!
That's exactly right! I can feel the\nShibuya love!
That's exactly right! I knew that you would\nunderstand.
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right. I'm impressed.
That's exactly why we came here to\nmake sure, Soy.
That's exactly why we have to change his heart. Especially since the real Kiuchi shows no signs of stopping on his own.
That's failing!
That's far too cheap! I understand it's busy,\nbut this is no time for games.
That's fine to start with! We can work\nthings out together!
That's fine with me.|I'm a tad nervous.
That's fine, really. Oh, {NAME1}-kun, do you\nlike superhero flicks?
That's fine. We can start today's class in\npower saving mode. In that case...
That's fine. We'll let you know when we're leaving.
That's fine.|Can't wait.
That's fine.|Let me rethink this.
That's good to hear.|That's too bad.
That's got us two weapons.\nBut we still need two shields, yeah?
That's gotta be the Core behind that guy,\nright?
That's great and all, but... is this really\na ninja technique?
That's great! But don't worry, I'm not tryin'\nto recruit you or nothin'.
That's great! I bet we'll get along\njust fine.
That's great, Kadota! You played one hell of a game too!
That's great. You not harassing her at the\nhospital really paid off.
That's great.|Oh, you just wanted to brag?
That's great.|Sounds tough.
That's handy...|Wow...
That's his Shadow?|He looks totally different!
That's how I want to live my life from\nnow on.
That's how it felt today. Once I started\nsinging, I was cool as a cucumber.
That's how teens today are.|I don't think so.|Someone's a meddling old lady.
That's how the catchphrase goes. But blood\nisn't always red, you know.
That's how we found out about that puzzle\nchallenge!
That's impossible!
That's it! That's the Treasure!
That's it! Why don't you teach me,\n{NAME2}-chan?
That's it! You only live once, right? I've\ngotta take my chances!
That's it, you're getting the hang of it!
That's it. I'm gonna go to the batting cages\nright now!
That's it...
That's just because you've never had real\nyakitori before!
That's just how feverish his body was. The\nwords put such a vivid and easy-to-understand\nimage in your head, right?
That's major progress!|Aw, without me?|What's the special today?
That's me! Haven't you ever heard the phrase\n"food is culture"?
That's me! You've heard of me before?
That's means we know our way around to\nsome degree.
That's more worrying...
That's my dear neighbor, Yukimi Fujikawa.
That's my guess. Even so...
That's my theory, at least.
That's nice.|Who are you?|......
That's not all! I actually feel the same aura\nfrom... well, you, sugar pie!
That's not an attack you want to take\nhead-on. You'd better guard this one.
That's not an easy thing to help someone get\nover, is it?
That's not good. Now I have no way to get\nhis permission...
That's not how it went! I'd figure out how to\nsolve things first, then I'd teach Haruna.
That's not it!
That's not it. I just know I'm bound to end\nup falling for someone who isn't so far away...
That's not it. Maybe this'll work...
That's not likely. If Katayama were the\nsole ruler, perhaps...
That's not our intention.|We're just trying to...
That's not surprising. In those days, the\ndistinction between a doctor and a magician\nwas unclear.
That's not to say I don't hope that it leads\nto romance, am I right!? Hahahaha!
That's not true!
That's not true. Sure, you may not say\nmuch, but...
That's not true.|So we're giving up?|Take's a whole nother issue.
That's not what happened! You two started it\nwhen you whipped out a lighter!
That's nothin' to be proud of!
That's okay! I'm glad you get it now.
That's okay. Let me know when you're free.
That's one down!
That's one flimsy motivation, I know. But I\nthink that's why I could keep at it.
That's one of the things I've learned from\nyou, {NAME1}-san.
That's our school's brass band. You know,\ntrumpets, trombones, stuff like that.
That's perfect, then.
That's pretty much how I feel all the time\nlately...
That's probably it. Watch where you step here,\nWonder!
That's probably not the least bit relatable\nfor you bambinos, though... Try this one on\nfor size, {PLAYER_NAME}!
That's quite probably the case.
That's rather spot-on! This author is far\nmore insightful than the average person.
That's real kind of you!
That's right!
That's right! A miserable leech like you\ndoesn't deserve anyone's kindness!
That's right! Everyone's number-one fave,\nNarumi Nashimoto, Naruru\u266a
That's right! I left some\nspare change in my bag...!
That's right! Its sweet and salty flavor is\nirresistible! But... how did you know?
That's right! Let's preserve the integrity of Victory Kitchen together.
That's right! Now then, what do you want to\ndo first?
That's right! Run home, drink some water,\nthen go to bed. And don't come back!
That's right! She is not the one who sullied your glorious future.
That's right! The ending of a war. Don't get\nme wrong, though, someone didn't stop a war\njust with math.
That's right! There's no time to think!
That's right! We do! Of course, we'd be happy\nto join you!
That's right! We got this far cause we all\nworked together! Thanks to you too, Shun!
That's right! We're gonna need weapons and stuff, right?
That's right! We're here because we wanted\nto be!
That's right! We're nothing alike! But...\nthanks for the compliment.
That's right! What's worse, there was\nanother me here wearing a skimpy swimsuit...
That's right! You stole my life as an athlete away from me and destroyed my dreams!
That's right!|Come back to school, Sensei.
That's right!|Show him the pride of a true chef!
That's right, if anythin' catches your\nattention, you can count on me to tell you\neverythin' ya need to know about it!
That's right, kiddos. You can use whatever weapons\nand gadgets and cool cars you like!
That's right, we need to find our friends. We\nhaven't even come across Closer yet!
That's right. A big stick. It's meant\nto imply military might.
That's right. Also, I assume Akashi wears\nsmart glasses as a means to catch his\n"villains" in the act.
That's right. And it's likely someone related to the shop is the next Palace's ruler.
That's right. Great job. The correct answer\nis Mesopotamia.
That's right. Great job. There are many\ndogs there.
That's right. He...!
That's right. Huge profits to be had from\ntrade were the driving force for sea route\ndevelopment.
That's right. I came here to study abroad\nright after graduating from high school.
That's right. I incorporated more dance\nelements into my flair.
That's right. I'm glad we can count on you\nto keep a level head, Leader.
That's right. It is a lesson. That you helped\nteach me, {NAME2}-chan.
That's right. It's France. "Beef" actually\ncomes from French.
That's right. It's about time I filled you\nin. Let's talk.
That's right. It's exactly how it seems. Our new broth is made with shoddy ingredients.
That's right. It's me, Merope, also known as\nyour concierge.
That's right. It's the liver. To be precise,\nmelancholy is the bile secreted from there.
That's right. Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk.
That's right. Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk. It's not a name\nyou hear often, is it?
That's right. Just before this, Sensei...
That's right. Kumi-chan came by a lot when\nshe was around your age.
That's right. Let's go talk to him now.
That's right. Let's go, Haruna-chan.
That's right. Now, stay sharp you two. Let's get moving!
That's right. The next step is sending the\ncalling card to make the Treasure\nmaterialize.
That's right. Then we can board the train\nfor Shinjuku. Let's hurry.
That's right. They never used wood.\nThe reason is because it rots quickly.
That's right. This is a Chinese restaurant, but its renowned ramen brought in lots of young chefs looking to train.
That's right. This place may look like\n<color=#FF423F>Kamoshida's</color> Palace, but it sure isn't the\nreal deal.
That's right... We were all proud of\nthat flavor...
That's right.|Easier said than done.|Well it's a valuable lesson.
That's right.|How many are there here?
That's right.|Let's change her heart.|Akashi's schemes end here.
That's right.|Let's do this.
That's right.|Nope.
That's right.|We changed Kiuchi's heart.
That's right.|We just ended our shifts.|What can I get for you?
That's right.|You're not wrong.|I'm always happy.
That's riiiiight!
That's rough.|Sounds like a workout.
That's so cool...|Wow...
That's so yesterday.|I'm hungry...
That's some real initiative!|She's got some fight in her.
That's still not <color=#FF423F>50</color>.
That's sudden.|Why?|......
That's sweet.|Lots of good memories there, huh?|Did you hit any home runs?
That's the Treasure.|Miyazawa's film reel transformed.
That's the Treasure? Looks like some kind\nof film reel...
That's the Treasure? The thing that caused his messed-up desires?
That's the best kind of answer.|Aren't you overthinking it?|Your dad's one smart cookie.
That's the best way to get hold of new\ninformation. What do you say?
That's the connection point for the cable.\nThis is our opening!
That's the contract I lost! Th-Thank you\nso much for bringing it to me!
That's the deal!
That's the drink I meant to buy, but the\nmachine gave me a different one.
That's the first I heard a this. What's it\nmean?
That's the gist of next class's experiment.
That's the guy. The one who made me quit\ndancing.
That's the idea. Of course growing our ranks\nwould improve our fighting capabilities...
That's the last Shadow. Now we can get the\ninformation we need.
That's the man we saw at\nNarumi's workplace.
That's the most important thing! Happy to\nwork with you, Russet.
That's the name he'd sign on his bills here.
That's the one mistake I can't bear to\nlive with.
That's the passion that drove him to become\na professional player, and ultimately\ncorrupted his desires...
That's the plan. What about you, Motoha?
That's the result of an evolved middle toe.\nA shape adapted to a life of sprinting.
That's the sound of the Akashi-looking\nShadow thing!
That's the spirit! All right then, I'll announce the date on my channel.
That's the spirit! Thanks so much, {NAME2}-kun.
That's the spirit, Shun.
That's the spirit, friend!
That's the spirit. Just know, I'm not gonna go easy on you.

That's the spirit.|Time to get super involved!
That's the spirit.|We'll change his heart.
That's the thing I admire most about humans. Count me in.
That's the third one! We did it!
That's the ticket!
That's the way to\nYongen-Jaya... Guess I should\nhead over there.
That's the wrong way.
That's the wrong way.|You really are bad with directions.
That's too bad.|I can wait.
That's too long to let it simmer...
That's true, but...
That's true, you and I have been hard at work\ncultivating our fields, haven't we, Russet?
That's true. Then shall we switch gears?
That's true... Maybe she coulda handled it\nbetter than she did...
That's true... People have probably seen\nthis all over the media. We'd hardly be the\nfirst to photograph it.
That's true.|But still...
That's uhhh... Well... Ahahahaha...
That's very kind of you. How about we do\nsomething when we're both free? Maybe even...\ngo on a date...?
That's very kind of you. How about we do\nsomething when you have the time then?\nMaybe even... go on a date...?
That's way more than what you asked for\nbefore. Besides, we're gonna forget\neverything when we leave.
That's what I like to hear!
That's what I think, at least.
That's what I want to do.
That's what I want.
That's what I'm talking about! We haven't done anything wrong!
That's what I've been longing to hear.
That's what all the new plants say when they come here.\nJust give up on those foolish dreams already, you silly carrot.
That's what all the other brats had to do.
That's what caught your eye?|Always thinking about food...
That's what it was like in our band too.\nWe all kept tossing in ideas till we had\na song.
That's what made me want to follow in her footsteps.
That's what we call a "runner's high".
That's what we were looking for...\nLet's go, Wonder.
That's what you guys talked about? I guess\nKano-kun loves him some ramen.
That's what you're getting at, isn't it?
That's what you're thinking right now, right?
That's when I developed an interest in liquor\nitself.
That's where you pour the rest of the batter\nstill in the bowl. You can do the honors.
That's why I at least wanted to pass on the\norange tabby's message to you.
That's why I avoided playing at the batting\ncages.
That's why I called out to you.
That's why I decided to unleash my power.\nThis was our victory.
That's why I don't want the momentum you've created for us to stop here!
That's why I have to study now.
That's why I need to work to support us all.
That's why I want you to come with me,\neven if all you do is act as my spotter from\nsomewhere nearby!
That's why I wanted to ask you both whether you're willing to continue working as phantom thieves or not.
That's why I was recruiting players, trying to make it so we have the minimum needed to play.

That's why I'm going to make sure that\nKiuchi has a change of heart!
That's why I'm thinking we should practice making plays between the two of us first.
That's why I've got to protect this flavor\nfor the rest of my life. It's my purpose...\nMy pride.
That's why I've really steeled myself\nfor this.
That's why I...
That's why Victory Kitchen tastes different than before!
That's why being around the two of you\nrelaxes me so. You're just so sincere...
That's why everyone resented him so much.\nWill you be liked or hated? It's tough\nto say.
That's why he started shit with her? So she'd\nbe labeled violent!?
That's why the beach is ideal for training.
That's why the title Menace applies to a\nfairly wide variety of people now.
That's why they're an ideal way to\nexpress love.

That's why we heard water.|It's really big.

That's wonderful news. You should go meet her.
That's your master plan!? Don't be so full of yourself!
That's...
That's... Kano-kun, isn't it? He's even\nwearing our school uniform.
That's... a Shadow?
That's... also the part I'm struggling with.
That's... not really what you say at a bar.\nStill, you're getting the hang of it!
That's... the girl\nfrom before...
That's\u2014
That, I do not know...
The "Persona" that Lufel\nmentioned... That power\nhelped me reclaim my desires...?
The "Subway Slammer" even got condemned by Divine Justice this morning.
The "ne-" part was an old form of "not."\nHence its meaning of not ever.
The "trade" he refers to is a capitalist one.\nCitizens purchase their safety via taxes.
The "work reform" he's been pushing\ndemoralizes the teachers and makes students\nless trusting of them.
The -ing makes it function like an adjective\nhere. This is called the present participle.
The <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> again, and with the same\napproach? How uninspired.
The <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> went away, just like we planned.\nLet's finish it off while we still can.
The <color=#FF423F>ball</color> we're missing should be this way.\nOnward, Wonder!
The <color=#FF423F>cable</color> goes to this room...

The <color=#FF423F>window</color> up above is open. We may be able\nto break in from there.
The <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> here should be useful\nin your work as a phantom thief.

The Metaverse Navigator is working again.\nLet us take our leave, Wonder.
The Metaverse Navigator's\nscreen is all staticky...
The Metaverse Navigator.
The Metaverse Navigator. Give it a tap.
The Metaverse and the real world exist in parallel with each other. They're structurally linked, which means...
The Metaverse contains two distinct species\nof Shadows.
The Metaverse, cognitions, Palaces, and Kiuchi's Shadow... Right.
The Metaverse? I see. So this place is a\nuniverse separate from our own? I can't\nbelieve something like this exists.
The Moon, Reversed
The Nobel Prize is awarded in a number\nof fields, but guess which field doesn't\nget one.
The Palace is starting to collapse!

The app icon was an eerie looking snake.
The appearance.|Your target customers.|Is it on-theme?
The area ahead is dangerous, it would be\nunwise to force our way through.
The area around here's cool, too. They\nplopped a modern marvel smack-dab in the\nold district.
The area beyond here is unexplored territory.
The area beyond this point is completely\nunder Kiuchi's control. It would be wise to\nproceed only when you're fully prepared.
The area we're in now seems to be the perfect\nclimate for them, though.

The cause...? It was...
The cerebrum.|The stomach.|The liver.
The challenge is to eat a burger bigger than\nyour face within the time limit.

The club itself was pretty chill too. More of\na "let's enjoy dance" vibe than anything.
The club room's closed for maintenance, so we have it off. Thought it'd be nice to walk home together!
The cognition of the Palace itself...
The cold wind and sweating combined\ncan make your body get dangerously cold.
The colors are so beautiful.|Looks delicious.|Can I take a picture?
The colors commingle yet remain beautifully\nharmonious within the glass.
The combination of rich broth\nand noodles... I've never\ntasted anything like this!
The competition is soon, so we're all\npretty fired up!
The complete opposite? You're kidding. How'd\nI get that turned around?
The concept may seem uncaring at first, but\nin reality, it helps us respect one another.

The crux of it lies in creating a deep\nunderstanding between proprietor and\ncustomer.
The curtains in the house\nacross the way are\nalways closed...
The customer doesn't\nseem satisfied...
The customer is there to comprehend the\nintentions of the proprietor.
The customer left positive feedback, too.\n"I was moved by your thoughtful delivery."\nWhat a glowing review!
The customer seems pleased!
The customer was delighted with the bouquet!
The customer was thrilled!

The electric fence and the security cameras\nhave been disabled. Well done, Wonder.
The electrical box must surely be hidden\ninside of here.
The electrical box seems to be above us.
The elevator is now operating.
The elevator isn't moving. It must\nrequire energy.
The elevator past here seems to be connected\nto the bank's deepest levels.
The elevator returned to the first floor!
The emergency exit is locked.
The ending was so hopeless and depressing\nit actually left a bad taste in my mouth.
The enemies ahead will probably be tougher.\nBe careful, everyone!
The enemies here are likely more aggressive than the ones we've faced thus far.
The enemies here are protected by some sort\nof ward.
The enemy has locked on to us.\nHave <color=#FF423F>Fox</color> use his<color=#FF423F>Keen Eye</color> to\ndefend against the attack.

The fame that eluded me for so long is\nfinally mine thanks to Divine Justice...!
The famed pirate Awilda! I just love that\none! She was a fifth-century Scandinavian\nprincess.
The farm's going to be\njust fine.
The fascinating thing about math is that\nseeking efficiency can sometimes lead you\nto common answers.

The weapon's manual was suuuper long. I fell asleep reading it. Kinda messed up my neck.
The weapons we got came with instructions, so I'll make sure to read up on those.
The west exhibit hall is now open.
The whole point is to understand each other.\nCan't go avoiding the heart of it.

Their numbers have thinned out. I think we\ncan handle them now.
Their power is in an entirely different league...
Their relationship?

Then I can make everyone smile with my\ncooking. Just like Pops hoped.

Then I remembered how you helped me out with\nthose part-time jobs. Thanks to you, I was\nable to walk right in there!
Then I suppose I have no choice but to join\nyou. Us kindred spirits must always stick\ntogether.

Then Miyazawa started dictating our flavor.\nHe filled the soup we poured our hearts into\nwith cheap, crappy bonito flakes.
Then Noge-san came and asked me what\nwas wrong!

Then again, I guess people might see me\nand think, "Who's that cute tanned chick?"\nRight?
Then again, I guess that beats standing\naround all day thinking of what to do!
Then again, I suppose putting it that way\nmakes me seem more suspicious! Ahahaha!

Then how about "Shoyu"?
Then how about we go there now and have a party
Then if Akashi is stealing Katayama's\ndesires away...

Then please take the opportunity to do so.\nSurely this is a decision you cannot ignore.
Then she told me all about how she'd been\nfeeling.
Then she went on to win a bunch of\ncompetitions...
Then should we go exploring? We won't go far.
Then somewhere along the way, I started to\nfeel like...

Then we add the topping. Which do we pick?
Then we can rank the celebrity critics based\non how dishonest they are!
Then we exchanged contact info\nand parted ways.
Then we have a deal. Let us prepare, and\nthen crack open this Nightmare's Gateway.

This is a clear act of violence,\nMs. Katayama! What on earth do you think\nyou're doing!?
This is a cognitive stronghold of the\nruler's own design. Unfairness is to\nbe expected.
This is a curious space. It resembles a\nPalace, but is nowhere near as sinister...
This is a fortress of his own creation in the\nMetaverse... He has free reign to do whatever\nhe wants. That includes destroying us!
This is a good opportunity. Moving forward,\nyou will assume control of our activities.
This is a good time to teach you somethin' ya\nnever learned at baseball training: how to\nbeg for forgiveness like a big girl.
This is a great clinic...
This is a great fishing spot...
This is a manga about a delinquent teacher\nthat was popular back in my day.\nIt's my Bible.
This is a nightmare... This can't be real.\nPlease let me wake up!
This is a photo album of my work.
This is a popular meetup spot. I wonder just\nhow many people sit here each day?
This is a room where the Palace's distortion is weaker. That means we're able to rest here safely. Hence, Safe Room.
This is a savory tomato-sauce cr\xeape.

This is all I've got right now...
This is all just a dream.\nA horrible dream...
This is all thanks to you, {NAME1}.
This is all too much, too fast.|I'm fine being average.
This is also my first time here too, so I'm\npretty much down for anything.
This is an <color=#FF423F>important book</color>... Gotta\nprotect it.
This is an announcement. A person has been\nseen on the tracks. We are making an\nemergency stop.
This is an idol's basic introductory call and\nresponse.
This is an outfit I coordinated from head\nto toe!
This is as far as you go, filthy intruders!
This is as good as enemy territory to me.\nLet's tread carefully while we investigate...
This is bad!
This is bad, we've got to get out of\nhere fast!
This is bad. At this rate he's going to call\nthe authorities on us. We need to get Kano\nand escape at once!
This is beyond my comprehension as well, but...
This is definitely a worthy submission. I'm\nlooking forward to seeing how it fares in the\ncompetition.
This is embarrassing, Dad... {NAME1}-kun's here...
This is even harder than they made it sound!\nThere's a ton to do, and a constant stream of\ncustomers.
This is exactly the authentic flavor of\nVictory Kitchen. The flavor Shun wanted\nto protect... Pops's flavor!
This is exciting! I have so many ideas about\nwhat Russet and I can do with this room!
This is for me?
This is from... after that baseball clinic...?

This is getting silly.|Stick to a premise!
This is going to be a fabulous room. I can't\nwait!
This is going to be tougher\nthan I thought...

This is horrible...
This is how you fight. Watch and learn.
This is incredible! Now I have to think of\nwhat to get you in return!
This is it! The lucky vending machine!

This is it. The fabled Hall of Lament.
This is it... There's no turning back now!
This is just a rumor, but I hear that if the doctor there likes you, she'll give you prescriptions for strong medicine.
This is just like Kaneshiro's palace. All of\nit must have been stolen from the helpless.
This is just my guess, but did it swallow a stack of tickets...?
This is just the form I took when I came to this world.
This is less than ideal. There are few\nplaces to hide.
This is life-changing! How dare you three\nkeep this flavor all to yourselves!? The\nnerve...
This is long overdue, but the truth is,\nI was happy.
This is making me crave sushi...\nI wonder if Lady Ann would share\nsome with me? Probably not...

This is my hope for you, as your concierge.\nNow please, begin whenever you are ready.
This is my mind, so you're going to play by my rules!

This is no time for japes.
This is no time for jokes!
This is no time to be checking every nook\nand cranny, Wonder.
This is not Pops's flavor!

This is our club room.
This is our only chance!

This is quite the venerable old building.\nThis is what they call "retro" these\ndays, correct?
This is such a BK. Oh, that's short\nfor buzzkill!
This is such a natural composition right now,\nthough, and I don't want to lose\nthat atmosphere.
This is such an unusual place.
This is supposed to be Kiuchi's desire? What does it mean?
This is supposedly Miyazawa's perception of reality...
This is the Treasure that stole Tomoko's dream away from her!
This is the age we live in. One photograph\ncan throw a person's entire life into chaos.
This is the armory. Hopefully we can find\nequipment for those statues...
This is the extent of what I can do.
This is the first time I've been here, but it feels familiar somehow.
This is the first time in ages I've heard him\ntalk about something besides school.

This is the spot where I took a tumble...
This is the time for you to discover what you\nlike and think about what you want for your\nlife.
This is the walking course we came up with.\nMy muscles are confident it'll be a success!
This is their desire for speed given form.\nI'm sure you have experienced a\nfamiliar feeling.
This is their fault... Those sinister, vile women... They did this to me!
This is to make it up to you for that\nother day...
This is what I've been wanting to see. I forgot how good this feels...
This is what that guard just now must have been trying to protect.
This is where I always do my shopping!

This is... Hoom, it seems my intuition was\nnot misguided after all.
This is... a <color=#FF423F>Palace map</color>.
This is... a cognitive being.
This is... harder... than I thought!\n{NAME2}... How you doing?
This is...!
This is...|It's about Kiuchi's arrest.
This isn't a dream, right? If I'm going to\nwake up, now's the time...
This isn't about being annoyed by other\npeople, it's about what I have to do for\nmyself.
This isn't fiction! New assassins don't just\npop up whenever you want.
This isn't good. He's amplifying her anger...
This isn't over till the bottom of the ninth. But you won't get a chance at a walk-off home run!
This isn't so much math-related as it is\ntrivia, but I'll ask anyway. Try answering\nthis, {NAME1}-kun.
This isn't something for the faint of heart.\nAre you ready?
This isn't the full band, but it gives you an\nidea of what a cheer song sounds like.
This isn't the place for it, though. Let's\nhead on over to Ogikubo.
This isn't the right place.
This isn't where we need to go right now.
This isn't where we need to go right now.\nOur priority is to <color=#FF423F>defeat Kiuchi</color>.
This juice is always sold out, so very few\nstudents have actually laid eyes on it.
This just means we made it to the\nmain course!
This key should open the cell door...
This keychain is really important to me.\nI don't know what I would've done\nif I'd lost it...
This keychain's actually a present we exchanged back in little league.
This kind of subtle, unexpected change...\nMaybe that's what I've been looking for.
This kinda feels like trespassing...
This last pitch's mine!

This looks like a good spot.
This looks like a magical girl manga...
This looks like a specialized lock...\nPerhaps it needs to be disabled remotely?
This looks like an exit.

This makes me so, so happy!
This map has no details for the third floor.\nIt might not lead to anything, but...
This may be difficult to understand from the\noutside, but that is how it is.
This may not be an adequate expression of my\ngratitude...
This may require investigation.

This route is thick with Shadows.\nLet's find another way.

Uh... At least for this song, I think if I\nhad some way to kick myself into gear...
Uh... Hey! That was really awesome! You hit\nso many home runs!

Uh... I'm not sure how to explain...\nYou tag a runner while holding the ball,\nand they're out?
Uh... Oh, yeah! Totally. Anyway, I'm keeping an eye on him till I can find out more.
Uh... Well, in that case...
Uh... What are you doing?
Uh... What're you looking at over there?
Uh... When you put it like that it sounds\npretty cringey...
Uh... no...
Uhh, I asked what you would want to do\nwith it...
Uhh, Lufel? Where exactly are we?
Uhh, the Phantom Thieves or something, right? Saying they planned to steal Kiuchi's desires...
Uhh, well, ahaha...
Uhh...
Uhh... So basically we've gotta prove\nourselves by <color=#FF423F>stealth-attacking</color> an enemy?

Um, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
Um, listen...
Um, never mind, sorry. I'm still having difficulty parsing my returning memories.
Um, no that's...!
Um, not that you need support or anything!\nI mean, it was just me being nosy! I mean\u2014!
Um, please don't say that so loudly... I'm\ntrying to keep a low profile...
Um, say, {NAME1}-kun... Do you think we can\nhelp her out with those chamomiles somehow?
Um, ten, twenty... Wait, what're you trying\nto make me admit to!?
Um, that wasn't supposed to be praise. And\nI'm definitely not following your example!

Um, what?
Um, yeah.
Um, your name is Kotone, right? <color=#FF423F>Kotone\nMontagne</color>?
Um, {NAME1}-kun! I feel the same way!
Um, {NAME1}-kun? I kind of have a favor to\nask you...
Um, {NAME1}-kun? Our shift's over, remember?
Um...
Um... About thirty minutes till the school\nday ends.
Um... Could I talk to you for a second?
Um... Do you guys think this could maybe...\nbe the last time?
Um... Do you happen to sell cooling spray?
Um... Do you think you could keep doing\nthat, but calmer? I want the lead-in to be\nsuper gentle.
Um... Have we met somewhere before?
Um... Huh...?
Um... I'm good today.
Um... I'm really sorry about this, but could\nyou come meet me here?
Um... Kotone-san?
Um... Oh, you're the chef from Victory Kitchen, right?
Um... So a Shadow we thought was defeated\nreappeared again?
Um... So you're Wonder, that's Soy, and this\nodd little guy is Cattle?
Um... Sure, go ahead.
Um... The usual...
Um... Unlike everyone else,\nI'm not very good at talking...
Um... Well, it's not like I've never\nperformed at all.
Um... Yeah, well, you know...
Um... well, actually...
Um... yeah.
Um...!
Um...?
Umetane!?
Umetane's new product announcements are way\nmore interesting than that Miyazawa\nguy's videos.
Umetane's umeboshi will be sold at Kichijoji\nStation until the end of the week.
Umetane?
Umm, so this one here...
Umm, so...
Umm...
Umm... Okay. It's a cr\xeape! One of those\nbanana custard ones!
Umm... Sorry, mind if I take a bite of that\nfried rice you got there?
Umm...|I have so many questions...
Ummm, should we cancel?
Ummm, so your name is...
Ummm... His name is {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nRiko-senpai.
Ummm... How do I put this?
Ummm... If I'm being honest, it was... mediocre.
Ummm... We already did the whole "welcome,\nblah blah" thing.
Unable to bear the weight of his own conscience, Kiuchi confessed to further offenses.
Unable to bear the weight of that reality, the Palace's ruler will confess his wrongdoings by his own will.
Unanimous decision?
Unauthorized access.
Unbelievable!
Unbelievable!|Let's make a complaint.
Unbelievable... Did he figure out the\nlocation of the Core all by himself?
Unbelievable... So you want me to just turn\na blind eye to dangerous behavior?
Unbelievable...! You actually beat the\nUniverse-sized Challenge!
Uncle! I'm thirsty, I want some too!
Uncle?
Unconditional love was always right there\nin front of me!
Under the control of Kiuchi's intense desires, they have forgotten their true forms.
Under the guise of authority, you stole your apprentice's ideas
Under the ocean.|Over land.|Through telepathy?
Understandable, but we're here to\ninvestigate, remember?
Understanding the system a bit more should\nhelp you enjoy capsule machines even more\nin the future.
Understood!
Understood! Right this way.
Understood.
Understood. I will be waiting for you in\nthe appointed place.
Understood. I will wait here until you've decided.
Understood. Once you're prepared, give me a hoot.
Understood. Permit me to ask a few\nidol-related questions, if you will.
Understood. Speak to me again when you\nare ready.
Understood. We make our move tonight.
Understood.|Thank you.
Unfazed, huh? Well, that's reassuring\nat least!
Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to\nkeep working here much longer.
Unfortunately, I haven't found a go-to place\naround here yet.
Unfortunately, I'm still not allowed\nto drink.
Unfortunately, it loses a lot of its\nnutrients when you boil it.
Unfortunately, it sounds like she hasn't been\nas successful in training her junior.
Unfortunately, it's the truth. This video\nalso means...
Unfortunately, my experience with music\nis rather rudimentary. I can't even tell\nif the song is good or not.
Unfortunately, that's not possible.
Unfortunately, the correct answer is apple.
Unfortunately, we can only award you the\ngrand prize once...
Unfortunately.
Units are annoying, I get it.
Universe-sized...? I shudder to think.\nWhy not step up to the challenge?
Unknown peril lies beyond those doors.\nWe can't take you with us.
Unleash your rage! Let it burn!
Unless we catch him in the act, there's really no way to arrest him.
Unlike me, Motoha was this ultra-skilled baseball prodigy.
Unlike me, it sounds like her injury might\nrecover completely with rehabilitation.
Unlike me, you seem blessed with\nmany companions.
Unlike ours, many of them don't let minors\nin, though...
Unlike part-time work, the only money you get\nis for your travel expenses.
Unlike the other students, she understands\nwhat needs to be done and acts accordingly.
Unregulated tax collectors had left\nthe common folk unable to afford\neven the bare necessities.
Unsurprisingly, even the interior resembles\nKaneshiro's Palace.
Unsurprisingly, it's rather challenging to hear the area ahead from this spot.
Until a few years ago he was this incredible,\nfiery rookie that everyone said was destined\nfor greatness in the major leagues.
Until going into her Palace and seeing who\nshe really is, I didn't trust Ms. Katayama...
Until he finds a new host to exploit, he\nplans to keep the Palace on lockdown!
Until next time, then! Howdy-hey!
Until now, I thought that I shouldn't look\nat the faces of my customers, but...
Until then, I'll try making the best songs I\ncan on my own.
Until then, howdy-hey!
Until yesterday you were an ordinary high\nschooler, and here I am asking you to take on\na job that will put your life at risk.
Until you get your strength back.|I'll stay with you forever, Tomoko.
Up here, it's just you and\nthe view... There's no one\naround to spoil the moment.
Up until now, I've really only done the bare\nminimum in order to pass my tests, but it's\nstill so difficult.

Urgh, all this running made me hungry...
Urgh, just ignore this idiot. Still, it would\nbe nice to find Joker already.
Urgh... I can't stand all this overtime...\nDo you sell any energy drinks?
Urgh... I get your point, but is waiting\naround here really gonna get us anywhere?
Urgh... Sorry you had to see that.
Us adults are supposed to support that! Not\ncrush children's hopes!
Use it to slice up the enemy!
Use its power well...
Use that opening to strike again.
Use that to heal when you're in a pinch. Let's move.
Use your <color=#FF423F>Gun</color> to aim for the enemy's\nweak points and knock them down!
Use your environment to hide in enemy\nterritory! That's the way of a Phantom Thief.
Used against her?|She's being manipulated?
Used to be no one came up here but me...\nWell, it's all yours.
Using medicine in different ways.|Washing hands and disinfecting.|Good bedside manner.
Using my bonito flakes has cut down your expenses and labor costs.
Using today's humidity and your student\nnumbers, let's ask... {PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Usually "powers of transformation" would mean\ntransforming yourself, right?
Usually the protagonist dies, is reborn in\nanother world and becomes OP.
Usually this is where you'd would say something like, "Hoohoo! What stupendous desire!"
Usually, yeah.|I don't.
Utilized properly, this power will be a\nvaluable asset to our cause.
Uuugh, I'm exhausted...
Uwaaaooo... Aaah!
Various items are\nfor sale here...
Various theories continue to be tested...
Vegetables need nutrients to grow just like\npeople do!
Verbal abuse against someone you've just\nmet is a violation of compliance.
Verbally abusing students...
Very astute, Panther. In which case, let us\nfind the remaining two balls.
Very creative, but nope! The answer is\nsomeone worthless, useless, or like a waste\nof space.
Very good! It seems you got it right!
Very good, now we can pass. Let's go, Wonder.
Very good. Then off we go.
Very nice! You know when you're serious\nabout gains like we are, it comes with a lot\nof dietary restrictions.
Very sharp, Wonder. I was thinking about that\npart myself.
Very unique!
Very well, leave it to me!
Very well, leave it to me.
Very well, then. We'll return to the library.
Very well.
Very well. Do let me know if you change\nyour mind.
Very well. If you insist.\nI'll step out for a moment to talk.
Very well. Let us proceed with our contract at once.
Very well. Let's give it our all.
Very well. Once you've finished preparing,\nyou can get to cleaning.
Very well. The desire to learn is important.\nThis is not something you can pick up\novernight.
Very well... I'll take you out here and now!
Very well... Then I shall be waiting here.\nDo let me know if you change your mind.
Very well... This is our first mission after all.
Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku is a branch store of Heritage Kitchen.
Victory Kitchen is officially becoming a\nchain!
Victory Kitchen's true flavor was ruined... What they're serving now is a betrayal to their customers.
Victory Kitchen, the shop entrusted to me\nafter its owner fell gravely ill...
Victory Kitchen... That's the ramen shop in\nShinjuku. Let's visit when we have\nthe chance.
Violence is prohibited.
Violent teacher! Violent teacher over here!
Violent!? I'd never do anything of the sort!
Violet appears to have\nquite the appetite...
Violet claims to have seen a figure with\ntwo heads.
Violet is an honest person, so I think she\nsaw what she says she saw.
Visiting hours are over for today, so I'm gonna go tell her tomorrow.
W-Wait! You promised to transfer me if I got\nyou one last signature!
W-Wait, Yusuke!
W-Wait, come back!
W-Wait...! What's that!?
W-We could never do that to you!
W-We'll definitely behave!\nHe's just uhhh, sleepy! Yeah, sleepy.\nIsn't that right...?
W-Welcome!?
W-Well you're not wrong... There are a lot of\nweird shops around here...
W-Well, I guess if they'd let us use your\nclub room that would solve our problem...
W-Well, I suppose I should at least introduce\nmyself to them... It's the least I could do\nfor barging into your home like this.
W-Well, it's not as if there aren't taller\nbuildings in the world, is it?
W-What are you talking about!? If she didn't\ndo anything, this wouldn't be happening,\nwould it?
W-What?
W-When did you\u2014!?
W-Wow...! Y'know, you shouldn't tease your\nelders!
Wa... Waaaaaah!
Waaagh!?
Waaah!
Waaah! Is this the same thing that happened\nwith Kiuchi?
Waaah! Wh-Who are you!?
Wah! That owl's talking! Wait... Are you...\nLufel?
Wahaha! You're my one and only rival after\nall, Motoha Arai!
Wahahahaha!
Wai\u2014 Huh? What!? Where are you going!?
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute... Am I just recreating\nmy room?
Wait here, I'll make us something. You're\nhungry, right?
Wait there, Wonder. It seems there may be\nsomething around this painting...
Wait!
Wait! No, I meant I'm not a weirdo! Although\nthere are some who might argue with that.
Wait! One more thing!
Wait! There's something there!
Wait! We're just making mocktails! Th-That's\nall we're doing, okay!?
Wait! You live around here, right?\nWant a job?
Wait, I hear a voice from that room...
Wait, I shouldn't stick\nmy nose in other\npeople's business.
Wait, I was on the train...\nThen a bike...
Wait, I was right? WOO! All right, let's take\na tea-filled tour of Nakamise Street for some\nyummy snackaroos!
Wait, Kurosawa.
Wait, Ryoko! Don't...
Wait, Take-kun? Why would he...
Wait, Wonder.
Wait, am I dreaming? When did I go to sleep?\nWait, what?
Wait, as in your house!?
Wait, but if I perform the way others expect\nme to, then my own style would be...
Wait, but maybe it does smell a little funky\nhere... No, I must be imagining it!
Wait, did you injure your hand?
Wait, didn't Akashi say he deleted that?
Wait, do you guys not know about her past?\nShe was pretty well-known for\u2014
Wait, does that mean there's demand for it?\nMaybe a full-on maid bar could work...
Wait, does that mean we have to actually\nfollow his script to go through the palace!?
Wait, don't cry, Mr. Higashino!
Wait, duh. Your parents are on a trip, right?\nSo you've got the place to yourself.
Wait, hang on, "It's being stolen"? What's being stolen?
Wait, hang on. Since when do you two know\neach other?
Wait, he had a part-time job there!? That's intense.
Wait, hold on!
Wait, huh? How did you get the stamp then?
Wait, is it even okay for cats to have\ncoffee and curry?
Wait, is it still morning? Should I be saying\ngood afternoon?
Wait, is it though?
Wait, is that it? I was hoping to ask more\nabout Katayama and Akashi.
Wait, is this...?
Wait, isn't that cheating!? We could hammer\naway at that thing for years and it wouldn't\ntake a scratch!
Wait, isn't that him right there?
Wait, isn't that the ex-baseball player Kiuchi?
Wait, it sorta looks like a door.
Wait, look!
Wait, my apologies. Such a task must be mere\nchild's play for you.
Wait, no! I'm not a cat!
Wait, one should confirm one's own mysteries\nfor oneself! Though, I never thought I'd be\nthe subject of my own research.
Wait, really!?
Wait, really!? Yaaay!
Wait, really!? Yesss! I get to have a\nmocktail from {NAME2}-kun!
Wait, really?
Wait, really? This stuff is pretty heavy,\nyou know.
Wait, seriously...?
Wait, so disappearing from the train and all\nthis other weird stuff going on around you...
Wait, so how old are they now? They looked\nto be only in their thirties at most...
Wait, so is this Akashi's Palace after all!?
Wait, so you ARE a cat!?
Wait, so you're a chef? Whoa!
Wait, sorry...
Wait, that app...
Wait, that's a Shadow ahead!\nIt seems to be blocking the exit.
Wait, that's right! Rhythm!
Wait, there's a device that waters your\nplants for you!? Oh, but it's pretty\nexpensive.
Wait, there's a strange noise coming from the\nnext room...
Wait, there's no way we can walk there!
Wait, this doesn't look good!
Wait, unless... there's still that...
Wait, we didn't introduce ourselves yet.\nHow'd you figure that out?
Wait, we should search the area for clues.
Wait, we're not gonna steal it?|So we just wanna find it?
Wait, what am I saying!? I'm still in the\nspringtime of my life too!
Wait, what? Are you saying you like m\u2014
Wait, what? We're locked in!?
Wait, why are we in our thief outfits? We\ndidn't use the Metaverse Navigator!
Wait, you can see the bags under my eyes!?\nBut I tried so hard to cover them up...
Wait, you don't know what that means?\nIt's someone who's totally out of touch with\nwhat's going on around them.
Wait, you don't know!? But you're "chosen"!
Wait, you're not gonna finish the story?
Wait, you're skating in the tournament!?\nYou mean\u2014!?
Wait. Did the Metaverse Navigator just talk?
Wait. Has that... happened to you before?
Wait. Hold on a second. That might actually be a good idea.
Wait. Huh? Who just said that...?
Wait. I sense an ominous presence ahead.
Wait. Let's defeat the shadow near the\ntreasure chest before we open it.
Wait. Now that I think about it, you're\nyounger than me too aren't you, Sensei?
Wait. Shouldn't there be Shadows here?\nDoesn't their absence seem strange?
Wait. Something is coming.
Wait. That icon...
Wait. Was it from when I bumped into you?
Wait. You should inquire about the password\nto Akashi's PC.
Wait...
Wait... Are you all\u2014
Wait... Could this be the "dinner disaster"!?
Wait... Did you just have some kind\nof vision?
Wait... Don't tell me... You really hoped\nsomeone would love you?
Wait... Is Shun actually noodle-brained?
Wait... It sounds like you're leaving us to\nfigure out the whole kit and caboodle by\nourselves.
Wait... Joker!?
Wait... No way! Tomoko!?
Wait... R-Really?
Wait... Takanashi, what time is it!?
Wait... That's it. At last I understand!
Wait... That's right. He said he looked up\nto the movie stars he watched as a kid.
Wait... The "Book of Domination"?
Wait... Was that...?
Wait... Would medicine actually help with that?
Wait... You mean you'll take me to the\nstation? Wow, that's so nice of you!
Wait... You wouldn't help me fight him?
Wait... are you interested in that stuff?
Wait... is that a ball behind him?
Wait...!
Waiting? You mean she seriously thinks I\ncan solve these?
Walk by|Avoid him
Walking after a big meal is great! I can feel\nthe calories burning!
Walking around like he owns the place.
Walking seems so easy. I had no idea I was\nthis outta shape...
Walking through a vibrant city like this\nalways makes me feel energized.
Wanna buy some?|They look hard to grow.
Wanna come here again?
Wanna come to my place?|Nothing comes to mind.
Wanna get dolled up tonight and head to\nGinz' for some yummy soosh?
Wanna give it a go? I can give you some hints\nif you need, hehehe!
Wanna go for cr\xeapes? I've got a coupon.
Wanna go together then?
Wanna go try that new caf\xe9? Remedial classes\nare so boring.
Wanna join me for her review of it?
Wanna join the Band Club? We play music\ntogether!
Wanna ride the aqua bus?|How about the aquarium?
Wanna see my skills!?
Wanna stop by the theater on our way home?
Wanna trade all of them in?
Wanna watch it at my place?|Sorry, I'm busy right now.
Want me to get you something sweet to eat?\nOr put some extra sugar in your coffee?
Want me to go ask with you?
Want me to strike a pose?|Are you okay to keep going?
Want some help?|No need to thank me now.
Want some of my lunch?
Want to come with us, {NAME2}-kun?\nTsurumi says she knows a really good spot!
Want to go get something to eat once\nyou're done here?
Want to know how I died? Heehee, maybe\nI'll tell you if I become your mask...
Want to learn more about swimming\nand fitness?
Wanted to run a cr\xeaperie too now that I think\nabout it. I was a greedy little gremlin, huh?
Wanting to be loved is human nature!
Wanting to help someone in need...
War.|Peace.|The same.
Warm water...? Fox, is it just me or are you\nalways hungry?
Warning. Dam energy supply depleted.
Warning?|What is this about?
Was created by the twisted desires in\nMs. Katayama's heart. Is that correct?
Was he already recording when he entered\nthe room?
Was he just talking to someone...?
Was it a limited edition Golden Drink?\nOr a regular Silver Drink?
Was it really that idol?|They could tell from that angle?
Was it really that tough?|You were really struggling.|Teen consultant, at your service.
Was it spicy enough for you?|I can barely feel my tongue...
Was it that good?|I guess they liked it.
Was that an interview?\nWow! It's like you're a celebrity\nor something!
Was that... Kano-kun just now?
Was that... a saxophone? Maybe? It sounded\nso smooth yet confident...
Was that... relevant to something?
Was that...?
Was the author of "The Tosa Diary" a man or\na woman?
Was there a time limit?
Was there another problem with students?\nI heard that Mr. Akashi took care of it\nfor you.
Was thinkin' I'd go buy some more.\nWanna come with?
Watch it, moron! Ya coulda killed me!
Watch me! I'm not going to lose!
Watch my back.|What do you want to do?|Let's stop them.
Watch out!
Watch out, Wonder, there's a Shadow ahead!
Watch your health during difficult fights.\nYou mustn't neglect your healing!
Watch your time carefully.|Don't get kicked out.
Watching Shiro's performance\ntaught me how to woo people\nwith charm...
Watching the world change around you\nisn't the worst feeling, you'll come to find.
Watch|Not today
Water has its advantages, bein' zero cal\nand easy to access on the go.
Watermelon flowers are these cute and tiny\nlittle things.
Waves vibrate through air particles, which\nvibrate your eardrums and register as sound.
Way to go, friend! That's it! I'll find a\ntranquil place where I can help solve\nher problems!
Way to go, {NAME1}!
We absolutely do not!
We accept.|We have no other options.
We ain't got time to be standing around.\nTaking it makes this place collapse, right?
We all had to wear matching outfits and\npractice until we were in perfect sync.
We all have those days, I suppose.\nHow about we pack up and get going?
We all introduced ourselves\nand got up to speed...
We all know how frenzied people can get when\nthey're after a certain game or special pair\nof shoes.
We all like different things.|Taste is subjective.
We all live in the same reality.|Give up and it's all over.|What's the age gap between you?
We all picked things we thought sounded\nmysterious.
We all worked together\nto remove the painting...
We all worry about how others see us...
We already have it.|What's been your motif all along?
We already talked about this. I know\nMiyazawa has some trick up his sleeve.
We also have non-alcoholic drinks available.\nGo ahead and sit wherever you like.
We also somehow just ended up here. We're\nlooking for a way to escape.
We are about to step foot into what can only\nbe described as "threat central." Nothing but\nnasties as far as the eye can see!
We are in possession of Kiuchi's Treasure, are we not?
We are in unknown territory, so we must\nnot let our guards down. Who can say if we'll\neven be able to find a way inside...
We are prepared. Be advised that I am\novercome with emotion.
We are referring to the new Persona you have gained.
We are regarded as <color=#FF423F>A-Tier</color> Kiuchi fans now.
We are standing in a crevasse between the\npast and present. Where the wills of the\nmasses surge and flow...
We are the chosen ones after all.
We are the only ones who can stop Akashi\nand Katayama's Shadows from running amuck\nafter all.
We asked the wrong person.|Some people are just like that.
We barely have enough members for our club\nas it is, and we're small fries compared\nto them.
We better hurry up, or we'll be late.
We both got sooo PO'd that we didn't talk\nto each other for, like, two full days!
We both logged out\nafter tending to the\nfields together.
We both thought it was best to stay out of\neach other's way... and so we never really\nbutt heads.
We call the meat of a cow "beef," but where\ndoes that word come from?
We came in by accident, but for better or\nworse, we seem to have landed ourselves\ninside of Miyazawa's Palace.
We can also proceed deeper into the palace.\nYour choice, Wonder.
We can catch our breath for a while. The Shadows won't come in here.
We can certainly infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace with this.
We can continue now.
We can continue this discussion at a later date.
We can describe a person whose actions\nnegatively impact others as a certain rotting\nfruit. Which fruit do you think that is?
We can discuss that later, but for now...\nthe correct answer is "gamble."
We can discuss that later. As I mentioned\na moment ago, I sense someone up ahead.
We can discuss the painting I'd like you to model for, too.
We can do it at my apartment.
We can either continue dodging the balls,\nor destroy the machine... It's up to\nyou, Wonder.
We can explain later. For now, let's search\nfor an alternative exit.
We can fix this.|Don't get discouraged.
We can get into the control room now!
We can get to the <color=#FF423F>lower level\nof the tower</color> from here...
We can give it a shot.|Sorry, not my kind of thing.
We can go down the elevator later. We need to\nfind the <color=#FF423F>balls</color> first.
We can go to places recommended by these\ncritics and verify their claims.
We can investigate together and share\nthe information we find. \nWhat do you think?
We can keep going through here, I think.
We can make our way safely now.
We can meet every day!|Let's get going!
We can move forward after we find those <color=#FF423F>weapons</color>.
We can only hope that no sewage\nis discharged.
We can proceed when you're ready, Wonder.
We can recover the hopes of victims being exploited by these outrageous acts.
We can start practicing for\nthe competition soon. I should\nkeep coming to rehearsal...
We can stop by when we have time.
We can think about that later! We need to get out of here!
We can think over what to check out next\nwhile we eat.
We can use the same method to lift this <color=#FF423F>grate</color>\nas we did the last one, Wonder.
We can use this on electricity and even\nfilter out thermal energy from the\nreservoir tank.
We can't accomplish anything down here.
We can't allow ourselves to get trapped\nagain! Let's get out of this place\nimmediately!
We can't allow ourselves to lose here! We'll\nhave to deal some damage to her!
We can't be careless here...
We can't be sure... Let's focus on\nthe shields and weapons for now.
We can't control what talents we're born\nwith, or if some accident leaves us injured\nand aimless. Sometimes we just quit...
We can't disregard her feelings. Let's steal\nit, Wonder.
We can't even swim here. This kinda sucks...
We can't go down yet. Let's find the <color=#FF423F>balls</color>\nfirst.
We can't go in here now it seems.
We can't have a calm discussion standing\nhere like this. Let's talk about it once we\nleave the Metaverse.
We can't just leave them be. If you're going\nto pull me aside, at least call for another\nteacher to deal with them.
We can't leave from here.
We can't leave our post!
We can't let him take anything else.|Let's expose his evil deeds.
We can't let ourselves be done in! We have\nno choice but to defeat Kumi Katayama's\nShadow.
We can't let the cops scare us outta\nbein' Phantom Thieves!
We can't let the cops scare us outta\nbein' Phantom Thieves.
We can't let this stand.|We'll take their desires back!
We can't meet at school since the suspension,\nso we came to you instead.
We can't reach from here. Let's move the box\nso we can get it into the other room.
We can't really ignore this.|The reward could be good...
We can't stay here! Let's go find her!
We can't talk about any of the big stuff,\nbut we can hang out! Right, {NAME2}?
We can't talk here, so let's go elsewhere.
We can't use it yet\nLet's search around for the remaining pieces.
We cannot reap the full benefits unless your\npositioning is perfect.
We chose to help you!|You didn't drag us into anything!
We continue like that until we've reached the furthest depths of Mementos.
We continued talking\nenthusiastically about\nunique part-time jobs...
We continued to hype\nourselves up until Tomoko and\nMiyu ran out of steam...
We could beg Miyazawa to retract the review, but that would mean...
We could do it here... or somewhere else...
We could go to Shimo-Kitazawa...|I'll ask our advisor.
We could have ordered just one for both\nof us.
We could keep exploring, but we're likely to come upon stronger enemies than we've ever battled before. Stay vigilant.
We could try aiming for the nose? Then\nit'll have to open its mouth to breathe!
We could use the energy transmission device\nto filter the thermal energy.
We count numbers one way in Japanese.\nFor us it makes perfect sense, and it's what\nour brains are used to.
We destroyed the electrical box, but...
We did enter competitions but we didn't care\nabout winning or losing.
We did great work together.|Couldn't have done it without you.
We did it! This should let us into the\nroom back there!
We did it...
We did it... right?
We didn't change Akashi's heart.|We couldn't steal Sensei's Treasure.
We didn't do anything. We're just here to\nbuy lunch.
We didn't talk.|What makes you say that?
We discussed this before, remember?\nMuch of the true nature of Shadows\nremains a mystery.
We don't have a clue...
We don't have enough <color=#FF423F>shields</color> yet, Wonder!
We don't have enough for full teams, so it'll be five on five.
We don't have much time. Let's make quick work of them.
We don't have the right climate for these\nto grow.
We don't have the stamp from the diner,\nbut not because the puzzle was too hard!
We don't have time to stop by the classroom!\nLet's head straight to the gym!
We don't know what he'll do. Stay calm and\nobserve the enemy's movements!
We don't need to watch it.|Let's keep moving.
We don't take patients without reason. Please\ncome back only if you're feeling unwell.
We don't usually take this train line.
We don't wanna forget you!
We each chose something we think is strange\nor mysterious.
We ended up in our\nthief suits somehow...!
We entered the Metaverse.|This is a world outside of reality.
We exchanged contact info with\nKotone and left the diner.
We exchanged contact info, and now she's in\nthe area and wants to meet up.
We exchanged contact info.
We exchanged numbers\nwith Yamagoshi...
We find Kiuchi's Shadow in the Metaverse\nand steal a certain precious item from it,\nthereby becoming Phantom Thieves.
We finished our fun and\nheaded back to Shibuya.
We finished our shift no problem! And we've\ngot the pay to prove it!
We finished today's club\nactivities with a fun and\nrelaxed atmosphere.
We gave the audience their\nencore and played Ayaka's\nnew song again.
We going in? Okay...
We got some new beans in today.\nFeel free to have a coffee to\ntry them if you'd like.
We got this far. There's no way Akashi's\nShadow can catch us, right?
We got this! Let's show 'em!
We gotta run!
We had no choice. If we had allowed ourselves\nto be trapped there...
We hadn't awakened our Personas at the\ntime, so we just ended up getting hauled\naway instead.
We hang out outside of school too, though.\nLike the other day.
We have a long history with them. You could say they're our rivals.
We have a lot of customers, so please be\nextra careful.
We have a lot of oddballs, but I hope we can get along. They're all excited to get to know you more.
We have a part-timer at Victory Kitchen who goes there too. Well, I guess he doesn't technically work there anymore...
We have all the books for each\nof the missing locations...
We have decided to make you confess\nall your crimes with your own mouth.
We have it in that aisle over there, kind of\ntucked away. Here, let me show you.
We have lots of festivities planned at the\nshop tonight, so without further delay,\nlet's head inside!
We have no choice. Time to make a\nrisky move.
We have no idea when the Food Fight is\nsupposed to be. Don't you think contacting\nKano right away is paramount?
We have our reasons.|We have a fight coming.
We have plenty left anyway. You can have\none each.
We have the order wrong. Hm, wasn't that\nShadow over there an administrator?
We have to act according to our values. Tough\nto be sure, but such is the path of a chosen\none...
We have to change his heart. First, we need\nto go looking for this Treasure thing, right?
We have to clean up this spot every few days.\nThe grass even stopped growing after a while!
We have to find Miyazawa's Palace and take it down.
We have to find a way to open this door.\nIf only there were any clues nearby...
We have to get it to Shun!|Shun needs it to win!
We have to get out of here first. I'll explain the rest on the way.
We have to make it materialize.|The real work starts now.
We have {NAME1}-kun now, so we have\nenough members to compete.
We have... multiple options.
We haven't done that in a while. Who are we playing?
We haven't planted anything here yet, so I\nwas scattering cyber watermelon seeds.
We headed back to the\nstation discussing ideas for\nour next song...
We heard about Kiuchi's confession through\nthe news. But actually seeing it firsthand\nis something else...
We heard that shouting from this way, but...
We hold club activities here every day, so\nstop by whenever you feel like it.
We just got a new roast in stock. Would you\nlike a sample?
We just got paid and all, so I thought we\ncould stop somewhere on the way home...
We just need to input Mr. Akashi's password\ninto this keypad, right?
We just received the results from our\nmock exams... Only I have discovered I made\nsome careless mistakes. How regrettable.
We just said to act normal...
We just saw it as our chance to practice and\nshow off what we could do.
We just talked a little about some of the\nstuff we've both been through, that's all.
We just want to hang out.|Quitting that easy, fettuccine?|We've worked up an appetite.
We keep running into each other today, huh?
We know he'll be around Shibuya Station, but we don't know what days or what time.
We know how to get in now!
We know now that all of these and more had\nbeen initially discovered by Cavendish.
We learned it at cram school, remember?\nIt means when things don't match up.
We left the accessory shop\nwith some extra pay.
We left the beef bowl\nshop with some extra\npay in our pockets.
We left the bookstore with\nsome extra pay in our pockets.
We left the burger shop,\nand parted ways.
We left the convenience\nstore, with some extra\npay in our pockets.
We left the drugstore with\nsome extra pay in our pockets.
We left with some extra\npay in our pockets.
We look forward to seeing you again.\n*chuckle*
We look forward to serving you again!
We made it to Mementos! What's next,\nCattle!?
We made it to the\nbottom floor...
We made it!
We managed to get\nthe final <color=#FF423F>baseball</color>.
We may be able to glean hints from\ntheir conversations.
We may be able to jump down using that cargo.
We may be able to overcome its invincibility\nif we learn more about the relationship\nbetween them.
We may be dealing with potato moles here!
We may be her only audience at present,\nbut please note that Naruru gives her all no\nmatter what.
We may have cleared out the enemies, but we shouldn't dawdle in a place like this.
We may just have to wing it. Assess the\nsituation, find an opening, and make a\ndecisive strike!
We may learn why in the course of\ninvestigation.
We may not be able to defend her if Shadows come attacking.
We may uncover an exit to the lounge if we\nsearch the vicinity.
We may understand, but that doesn't mean\nwe agree.
We meet again, as promised.
We meet again. Are you two on your way out?
We met her before you joined us...\nBut what's more curious is that machine there.\nWonder, perhaps we should investigate.
We met people who were familiar with it.
We met this morning! You're in the same\nclass as Motoha?
We might be able to find a suitable\nworkbench in Yongen-Jaya...
We might be able to stop the scythes by\nmessing with this device too!
We might be able to use this to get into\nareas we couldn't access before!
We might figure something out by talking\nto these people... If they are both people.
We might run into some conventional crime\nbefore we find the real threat.
We must attend this photo session.
We must continue onward, Wonder.
We must find another way in. Let's search the\nvicinity.
We must go after Take-kun at once!
We must hydrate the fields. Come along,\nRusset!
We must run, before we're surrounded!
We must think this through rationally. The\ntwo of us have the power to overcome any\ntrial.
We need a <color=#FF423F>lockpick</color> to open this.
We need a target for our Metaverse Navigator application to home in on.
We need an advisor. Someone to act as a sort\nof brain, managing the functions of the\nPhantom Thieves...
We need big yet faintly-scented flowers.\nLet's think this over.
We need someone who can deduce this\npuppet master's way of thinking and\nanticipate their next move.
We need to announce to the real Kiuchi that we plan to steal his corrupted desire.
We need to find a way into\nthe <color=#FF423F>second floor of the\nCentral Hall</color> first...
We need to investigate first.
We need to investigate the area to proceed\nfurther.
We need to know.
We need to pinpoint the location of the next\nPalace before I lose the trail.
We only need one more person, right?\nEverything will work out if we get one more.
We ought to be able to go to the next floor\nif we proceed this way.
We ought to begin by searching the area.
We ought to check it out, Wonder.
We ought to hurry over.
We ought to look into suspicious places when we come across them.
We passed each other on the sidewalk just\na moment ago.
We proceed with our investigation, of course.\nWe aren't nearly finished yet.
We promise to keep it to ourselves,\nof course.
We promise.|Understood.
We promised to meet again\nonline, then I walked her\nto the ticket gate.
We put our own music to the lyrics we wrote\nand performed it at our school festival.
We rallied in the end,\nand worked so well we\nimpressed the manager.
We really are two potatoes in a pod!<sprite=1 tint=1>
We really ought to test the safety of these\nrides ourselves!
We received a complaint from a parent\nyesterday saying their child's homeroom\nteacher just showed up at their doorstep!
We saw a lot of stuff like this earlier, too.
We say arbitrary triangle when we want to avoid all that mess.
We seem to be on the lowest floor.\nStay focused, Wonder.
We sent the calling card.
We shall act as the chosen ones! We don't\nstand to lose anything... I think.
We shall call them <color=#FF423F>Phantom Idols</color>!
We shall have to pick up where we left off\nat a later date.
We shall make monarchs stand and deliver!
We should also be on our way before this\nplace collapses!
We should be able to activate the elevator\nfrom the room ahead, but that Shadow looks\nrather formidable...
We should be able to get in from above.
We should be able to open that door now with\nthis ball. Let's go back and try it out.
We should be able to sneak in to the Palace\nfrom here. Stick close to me!
We should be able to use it to leap to the other side.
We should be reaching the exit any\nmoment now.
We should check it out.
We should compete to see who can\nharvest the most!
We should consider changing our\napproach, then.
We should consider taking them out first.
We should consider this carefully.|I want to think it over some more.
We should debut the song together! I'll send\nyou a message then.
We should discuss this before we make a\ndecision. Could you give us a moment?
We should examine this place carefully. We may\nfind some hint about the pattern we need.
We should figure out why she wants to help\nwith our investigation first, {NAME2}.
We should find the balls and stop the blades,\nfirst.
We should get away from here for now. Kiuchi is surely on his guard.
We should get going.
We should get over there right away!
We should get started.\nMake sure to give it your all!
We should get together when\nthe manager gets back from\ntheir trip.
We should go buy some!
We should go elsewhere.
We should go there\nanother time...
We should hang out more.|It is?|Glad it's a nice day.
We should head home as well.
We should help out.|All aboard!
We should hurry up and order. I'll have a\nlarge hamburger and fries.
We should hurry up and search elsewhere.\nThere is the issue of Joker too.
We should jump it before it spots us!
We should keep it all in one place instead.
We should keep that fake money\nin one place instead.
We should leak this story as a special feature before he gets to the majors.
We should leave this to Principal Kobayakawa...
We should make use of it when the time is\nright. So, should we head to Kiuchi's\nPalace now?
We should prioritize finding Katayama's\nTreasure.
We should probably train a bit\nmore before we try\ntaking them on...
We should retreat for now. Let's return\nto reality, Wonder.
We should return to the real world. We can discuss our next move there.
We should search for the password in the\nnearby vicinity.
We should take a good look around here.
We should take a minute to rest and get\nready before we go in.
We should try it.|All aboard!
We should try them together some time. I'd\nlike to sample lots of different flavors.
We shouldn't stay here.
We slowly and carefully grill it\nover charcoal...
We somehow managed to beat the boss.
We still haven't checked out the shop below\neither. Could go look for some souvenirs...
We still haven't found the next Palace.
We still haven't had a welcome party for\n{NAME1}-kun yet, right?
We still need to find more <color=#FF423F>weapons</color>, Wonder!
We still text and talk online sometimes,\nbut lately I've just been so busy...
We still text and talk online, but I still\ncan't help worrying... Should I still\ntrust him?
We suddenly wound up here somehow.
We take turns watching the kids between\ntheir regular school and cram school classes.
We talked about a bunch of stuff, like how\nwe've been doing, and I learned why she\nquit music.
We talked for a while longer\nabout musical instruments...
We tend to think of them being pickled to\nmake umeboshi, but there are actually a\nvariety of ways to serve them.
We tended the fields together,\nthen logged out.
We took a break and recovered\nour stamina...
We took the Core giving this space its\nshape. It's only natural for it to collapse\nnow.
We triggered the security system. They'll\nkeep on coming forever at this rate!
We understand.|They're taking advantage of you.|I don't think that will work.
We used to do the same thing at our farm back\nhome! Well done, Russet!
We walked through Asakusa\nsampling sweets to our\nhearts' content.
We wanted to hit a home run really bad, so we\npracticed our hearts out there.
We were back on good terms in no time. And I\nhave you to thank for it.
We were both being overly careful around each\nother, which led to a big misunderstanding.
We were dropped down a pit. It must have been a trap for intruders.
We were here first, ya know?
We were in some competition, and then someone\nin the audience complained about me.
We were just a little too slow... We're going\nto have to find the device that\ncontrols the elevators now.
We were just about to get the treasure,\nand now this stray cat is here... Seems like\nit's hungry.
We were just talkin' about how worried we are\nabout Ms. Katayama...
We were only able to escape last time because\nwe found that Core thingy!
We were right?
We were saying that from now on, as leader of the Phantom Thieves, you should command us in the field and in battle.
We were talkin' about it while you were off at kindergarten, you wouldn't've heard.
We were talkin' about weapon mastery and\nthe conversation kinda blew up.
We were very nearly spotted just now!
We will defeat the ruler of this Palace and\nget our hands on that Core!
We will have another chance. For now, your\nnext mission is to steal yourself some sleep.
We will resume travel after ensuring it\nis safe.
We will take your distorted desires without fail.
We won! All that training paid off!
We won! We actually won!
We won't be able to continue here now...\nLet's settle things elsewhere.
We won't be able to enter the Palace or\nsteal Akashi's Treasure?
We won't be able to fight any more of\nthe vassal Shadows...
We won't be able to force our way in.\nWe'll have to find another way.
We won't be able to get out of here if we\ndon't move it...
We won't know without a proper investigation.\nLet's go, Wonder.
We won't let him get away with this!
We won't let you!|We're going to save Naruru!
We won't.|We'll search the real world.
We worked together to revive the broth to its\noriginal\u2014 No. We've surpassed the old flavor\nto reach new heights of excellence!
We wrapped filming at our other location ahead of schedule. I know I'm a tad early, but I'm here now, so...
We'd all end up killing each other.
We'd better get it washed up first. Then\nI'll take care of it, okay?
We'd better go then!
We'd better tread carefully here. Let's scout\nthe perimeter, first.
We'd get teammates on the bench to shout.
We'd go to one of the band member's houses\nand jam out until their folks got home.
We'd lose our voices screaming on all the\nrides and then chat about music the whole\nway home.
We'll add the ingredients next. The order\nto put them in was...
We'll aim for the north side of the hall's\nfirst floor. Move out once you're ready.
We'll also need to change Madarame's belief that the door is unopenable...
We'll be able to say sayonara to this place!
We'll be counting on you to be even more upstanding than you have been thus far.
We'll be counting on you, {NAME1}!
We'll be going to Shujin tomorrow.
We'll be gone for a bit, so watch the house!\nWe'll bring you back souvenirs!
We'll be surrounded by Shadows at this rate!\nWe ought to pull back for now!
We'll be taking that shield off your hands!
We'll be trusting you to make decisions as\nteam leader after all. I'll go along with\nwhatever you decide. Do as you please.
We'll be waiting for you.|No playing hooky.
We'll be waiting. Stop by whenever if you\nchange your mind.
We'll do just that. The poor girl's at her\nwit's end, I can tell.
We'll explain later!
We'll fill this place with nature, just like\nMusubi's hometown!
We'll find a low-calorie cake.|We should share one.
We'll find a path from outside the gates,\nand enter the west wing on the 2nd floor.
We'll go to Kiuchi's Palace after school. Now that we have our way in, we'll investigate the inside.
We'll have a gas\u2014noble, inert, you name it!
We'll have to be careful here too...|If they find out who we are...
We'll have to call it here.
We'll have to deal with this area before we\ncan find the last ball.
We'll have to do something about the fence.\nMaybe those lantern things do something?
We'll have to find the right books, then.\nOff we go, Wonder.
We'll have to remove the Shadows first, then.\nLet's get to it, Wonder!
We'll have to steal the Treasure that day.\nWe can build up our experience in Mementos\nfirst. Let me know when you're ready.
We'll have to take these Shadows out first!
We'll head back to Mementos for now, then.
We'll head to the third area and go back to\nthat password protected door in Katayama's\nPalace. Understood?
We'll introduce ourselves properly to the staff there.
We'll just get you acquainted with the shop\ntoday. I'll give ya some pointers here\nand there.
We'll just have to be patient. This is a\nmemorable first step.
We'll just have to eliminate you right here!
We'll just have to take a guess.
We'll keep making them, so you just keep\nselling them.
We'll look for the Core while searching for\nSkull and Mona's friends. Let's go!
We'll look together.|Let's split up and search.
We'll make it work! Just ask anyone who\nlooks like they've got nothing better to do...
We'll make that villain pay.|Let's help Naruru!
We'll meet at midnight
We'll nail this contest!
We'll need a password. Let's search some of\nthe nearby Shadows for it.
We'll need flint in order to light the flame.\nI wonder where we could find some...
We'll need the Palace's ruler to do that for us.
We'll need to defeat them in order to\nthoroughly investigate this room.
We'll need to disarm that trap.\nLet's scout around this area.
We'll need to fight it if we want the spoils.
We'll need to find some way of unlocking it.\nCould there be a hint nearby?
We'll need to think of a new method for delivering the next calling card.
We'll need to\ninvestigate this\narea carefully...
We'll never finish all these orders unless\nwe team up.
We'll proceed once we're ready.
We'll put a dining table right there, along\nwith two chairs.
We'll record the whole thing on video, and\ntake photos at the end.
We'll retrieve the briefcase\non our end.
We'll return to party headquarters until our meeting
We'll show her what a good coach you are.\nSo to do that...
We'll simply try each name we can think of\nand eliminate suspects one by one. That's our\nonly option at the moment.
We'll take care of the girl on the tracks. Leave the rest to us.
We'll take care of the rest. Let us adults\ncarry the load.
We'll take it off your hands.|It's ours now.
We'll talk to our muscles, build 'em up,\nand help them thrive, like true workout partners!
We'll talk to our muscles, grow them, and\nhelp them thrive, like true workout partners!
We'll tell you what we know about this\ncastle, and you three can help us out in\nbattle!
We'll work! Our! Buuutts! Oooff!
We're about to arrive. Check to make sure\nyou don't forget anything in the car.
We're about to enter a wider area, so we'll\nuse my car form from there.
We're actually exploring right now!\nYuna-chan, Kyo-kun, and my mom are\nhere too!
We're all gonna get chopped in two if we\ndon't stop those scythes first...
We're all here to support you.
We're all leading a double life here.\nThis way we can at least relax\nwith each other.
We're an Exploration Team! We investigate\nmysterious places around town and school!
We're back at the vault\nentrance...
We're back in the library...\nLet's try searching again...
We're back.
We're business partners, are we not? By going together we can share information more readily.
We're business partners.|We live together.
We're celebrating today. My treat.
We're close to totally conquering\nthis palace, right?
We're counting on you, Kurosawa!
We're counting on you, Senpai. Sorry for\nbeing a bit confrontational at first...
We're counting on you, {NAME1}! Win this for us!
We're currently missing Skull, Mona, Queen,\nand Joker. That's four of our allies.
We're doing an event today, so it's all\nhands on deck!
We're doing fine! Your dad and I are having\na great vacation!
We're expecting a rush of customers soon.\nGood luck!
We're far from perfect, but I think it could\nwin us the competition.
We're filming at Victory Kitchen after this,\nright?
We're finally nearing the core...
We're finally out...\nWhat a long duct that was.
We're friends.|We're a team.
We're getting closer to the Core.
We're getting monjayaki?|No ramen today?|I came here the other day.
We're going to a mixer, but a friend of ours\nhad to drop out. Wanna take his place?
We're going to be swamped, so expect lots of\norders coming your way!
We're going to explore Shibuya!
We're going to have a scrimmage against a team from another school.
We're going to split into two teams and do a scrimmage!
We're going to steal the world's biggest ruby...\nOne that's even bigger than a watermelon!
We're going to the front of the shop,\neveryone! Follow me!
We're going to the vault's\nsecond floor. There are three\nfloors total, it seems...
We're going, Shun Kano. Come along.
We're gonna be eatin' ramen after this, so I\ngot us an order of the simplest one to split.
We're gonna buy every drink our school\nvending machine sells and try all of them! Yaaay!
We're gonna buy every kind of bread in the\nstore and review them all!
We're gonna have a lot of fun today!\n{NAME1}You ready, ?
We're happy to see you're feeling better,\nYamagoshi-san!
We're having a special sale, so some items\nare discounted.
We're having sukiyaki today as my farewell\nparty.
We're here!
We're here! This is it!
We're here.
We're here. Right beyond this point is... Hiromu Miyazawa's Palace.
We're hittin' up a diner today. I heard they\njust started a collab menu with another\nbig-name restaurant.
We're holding a concert at the local theater\ntoday! Come check us out!
We're in an alternate dimension right now,\nyou know...
We're in no hurry, so let's enjoy ourselves.
We're in public!
We're in the kitchen today. Uhh, I'll leave\nthat section to you.
We're in the process of planning a major\nramen-themed event called Ramen Promenade 2.
We're just glad we could be of some support!
We're kinda high up... One wrong move and\nyou're done for.
We're making good progress toward the\ntreasure. Let's stay focused!
We're meant to meet with those girls from yesterday, correct? We should head out soon, or we won't make it in time.
We're near the entrance.
We're not allowed to play soccer here, remember? Minami-chan, let's play the game from yesterday again!
We're not in the real world. Don't let it\nworry you.
We're not old enough to drink.|Yaoling is underage, too.
We're not on bad terms. I just don't know how to deal with someone like her.
We're not.|No need to worry.
We're on the same shift today. What luck!
We're only missing Closer, so that makes one.\nAll right, let's team up and find 'em all.
We're only supposed to invite the regulars,\nbut here you go!
We're open! Please visit our caf\xe9!
We're packed with customers today, so it's\na bit hectic...
We're phantom thieves, so let's just call ourselves "The Phantom Thieves," yeah?
We're phantom thieves. It'd be strange if they welcomed us in with open arms.
We're pressing on.|No way out but through.
We're pretty far in now, huh?
We're pretty far in the Palace now. The Treasure is bound to be nearby.
We're probably gonna start having more expenses soon, huh? Guess I should think about getting a job...
We're really going to splurge today. Let's\nload up on sukiyaki beef!
We're really gonna have to put our backs into\nit at the farm if we wanna reach that level!
We're running out of time. If you have some\npremonition that could help us find a\nsolution to this, speak up.
We're still getting lunch, right? It's gonna\nget crowded if we don't hurry.
We're still in Kiuchi's domain. I want to avoid the enemy overhearing our plan.
We're still inside <color=#FF423F>Mementos</color>, so Shadows\nmay attack us at any moment.
We're still quite far from the Core. We have\nfurther yet to go.
We're still some distance away from the Treasure.
We're supposed to be stretching. You need a partner, don't you?
We're taking your Treasure.|Hand it over!
We're the Band Club, but we're short a\nmember, so we can't form a decent band.
We're the only ones here, you know.|Actually, my parents are on a trip.
We're too tired for that. Catch you later.
We're trying to figure out what it possibly\ncould have been.
We're unable to leave. Some odd force\nseems to be at work.
We're very busy today... Sorry for throwing\nyou into this, but could you start\nright away?
We're... friends?
We're... pretty close, huh? Meh, it is just\nus here, I guess...
We've agreed to start working\nwith Riko Tanemura...
We've also paid people to line up outside\nthe restaurant.
We've arrived at the underground prison\nunscathed.
We've been caught!\nBetter silence them quickly!
We've been found! Prepare yourself, Wonder!
We've been noticed. Let's go, Wonder!
We've been on the move for a while now.\nI'd kind of like a little break myself.
We've been spotted, look out!
We've been tryin' tons of new foods, right?\nI based this on all of those times together.
We've been working here part-time lately.\nWe were on the floor until a minute ago.
We've both been separated from our allies.\nLet's take a moment to analyze the situation\nrather than running in blindly.
We've come this far. Time to end this!
We've dealt with the lackeys. Now for their\ncommander.
We've disarmed all the traps with that.\nAre you prepared to move ahead?
We've even arranged to buy the public's sympathy by revealing the "cause" of your unraveling through media outlets.
We've gained enough valuable intel on Kiuchi. Now let's make our exit.
We've got a club meeting today!\nSee you there!
We've got a new song to play for you today.\nJust hold on while we get ready!
We've got a score to settle.
We've got this.
We've got to find a way into the west wing.
We've got to help somehow.|Her family is her business.|I don't get what's going on.
We've got to keep going.|We'll set Miyazawa straight.
We've gotta get outta here, Fox!
We've made good progress strategizing.\nLet's pause here for now.
We've made good progress.\nWhy don't we take a seat and talk here?
We've made it this far into the conversation,\nbut we still don't know each other's names!
We've made sure that no customers will be\nallowed in until we are finished here.
We've no choice! Hurry through the door!
We've seen this mechanism before, though\nthere may be new tricks to it this time...
We've stopped?
We've successfully recovered two Treasures\nnow. That's thanks to your contribution as\nteam leader.
We've uncovered a hidden area. Let's\ninvestigate.
We... We actually did it!
Wealth and glory are within your grasp...\nWhoa, you've got a really good fortune\nthis time!
Weather is always a factor, and then there's\nthe insects!
Weeell, back when we were at Kamoshida's Palace, some of the books we needed weren't in the same room.
Welcome back! So, how did it go?
Welcome back.
Welcome to Shujin Academy!
Welcome to Takeyuki Kiuchi's Baseball\nExhibition! Marvel at an incredible career!
Welcome to my Velvet Room.
Welcome to my private city bank.
Welcome to the team!|Could you sit down please?
Welcome!
Welcome! Ah, I see that disastrous dinner\nhas already come to pass...
Welcome! Ah, it's Merope-san and her friend!
Welcome! How 'bout some yakitori?
Welcome! I hope you're enjoying yourself\nhere!
Welcome! Interested in hearing your fortune\nfor today?
Welcome! Let me know if there's anything\nI can help you find.
Welcome! Oh my, quite the young folks,\naren't you?
Welcome! Oh, are you here to take on our\nEating Challenge again?
Welcome! Oh, it's you! Care to try our\nEating Challenge?
Welcome! Oh, our champion has returned!
Welcome! Oh, {NAME2}-kun!
Welcome! Oh? You're a young one.
Welcome! Take whatever seat you like.
Welcome! The food we serve here isn't\nbound by any one genre.
Welcome! We've been waiting... You're here to\ntake our Eating Challenge, right?
Welcome! We've got a lovely lineup of\nseasonal flowers for you.
Welcome! What are you looking for today?
Welcome, I guess.
Welcome, Wind.|We're counting on you.
Welcome, welcome! We've got a special promo\nfor all customers today!
Welcome, welcome...
Welcome, you two. Make yourselves at home.
Welcome.
Welcome. Let me know if anything catches\nyour eye.
Welcome. Oh, it's you! Glad to see you again,\n{NAME2}-kun.
Welcome. Please take any open seat that\nyou'd like.
Welcome. We grill eel to order here.
Welcome...
Well I don't see any keys... Where could it\nbe?
Well I just made use of someone's cognition\nabout "animals transforming into vehicles."
Well I want your opinion on something. Do you\nhave some time now?
Well I'm sure if I order the salt or miso-flavored ramen it'll probably be fine.
Well I'm sure we'll uncover a great deal of the Palace's mysteries as we search for the Treasure.
Well actually... things are kinda tight right\nnow. Think we could split today?
Well darn!
Well done! See you next time.
Well done! That's right!
Well done!<sprite=1 tint=1>
Well done, Soy! Wait...
Well done, Soy.|Good work.
Well done, Wonder! Let's keep moving.
Well done, Wonder! Shall we open that <color=#FF423F>treasure\nchest</color> now?
Well done, Wonder.
Well done, Wonder. All that's left now is to\ndestroy the electrical box.
Well done, Wonder. Now let's check behind\nthe painting.
Well done, {NAME1}. I knew you had it in you!
Well done.
Well done. A clean room fosters peace of\nmind.
Well done. Now you're able to make money on your own.
Well done.|Don't let up now.|I can't wait to try it.
Well excuse me darlin', but it's not just me\nwho benefits from you using them machines.\nYou'd regret sitting this one out!
Well helloooo there, thank you for calling!\nI'm sorry, this is about the Food Fight\nvideo, isn't it?
Well hey there, Yu-chan! How'd your boy's\nbig test go?
Well if you start to feel sick at all, make sure you go to the doctor, okay?
Well if you two say so, then I'm prepared to give my all to the Phantom Thieves.
Well it's Ms. Katayama's Palace, so the\nnumbers should have something to do\nwith her, right?
Well it's that or be known as the guy that got beat by an elementary school girl.
Well now, I think I get the picture.
Well said.|I'm glad I asked.
Well shoot... I s'pose this is probably more\nyour area of expertise so... I'm gonna leave\noperatin' this thing to you!
Well that explains the tambourine...
Well that was exhausting... Perhaps a short\nbreak is in order?
Well that's sorted.
Well then stop playing games and start\nleveling up in real life.
Well then, I guess I'll take your advice.\nTime to make like a ghost and... disappear.\nI'm out of here.
Well then, I will make myself at home. If you\nwant to craft infiltration tools, give me a\nhoot and I will provide guidance.
Well then, I'll meet you here later tonight.\nI'll be waiting!
Well then, I'll see you all at school.\nLet's talk more then.
Well then, I'll see you on the next treasure\nhunt. I'm looking forward to it.
Well then, Motoha Arai, allow me to fill you in. Kiuchi is no friend of ours.
Well then, here's your pay.
Well then, how about one more? It's on\nthe house.
Well then, let's get out of here at once.
Well then, let's meet in front of Kokatsu\nAcademy next time!
Well then, let's see how we can help out\nYamagoshi today.
Well then, let's start investigating that\nbuilding.
Well then, let's take our leave.
Well then, once you're ready for the next\ntreasure hunt, please let the tabby know.
Well then, please excuse me. Thank you\nso much again.
Well then, see you soon.
Well then, see you...
Well then, shall we get started?
Well then, take care getting home, okay?
Well then, the finishing touch is a splash\nof coconut milk. Do you remember when to\nput it in?
Well then, we look forward to your next visit. Heheheh.
Well then, what do you have for me?
Well then, what now?
Well then, {NAME1}-kun... See you later!
Well then...
Well this sucks, but I guess we should be going too. The chef's apologizing and everything...
Well we won't know if we don't look, right?\nC'mon, let's go!
Well when you put it like that... It makes me want to try this place too.
Well, I actually have something to do too,\nso let's talk another time...
Well, I am still a newbie and all... This\nfeels like just the bottom of the first\ninning.
Well, I can't say I'm back to a hundred\npercent yet.
Well, I did some digging into the companies\nhe worked with.
Well, I don't intend to criticize your\ncreativity, but it just lacks the panache of\na phantom thief.
Well, I feel all rested up from my walk, so\nI should be heading home.
Well, I feel bad everyone was being so\nnoisy, but it was kinda startling the way she\nblew up like that.
Well, I feel like I've got a\ngood idea of what to draw now!
Well, I guess I already accomplished my goal when we changed Kiuchi's heart and avenged Tomoko. But...
Well, I guess I should figure out how I'm gonna spend my time after school from now on.
Well, I guess I'll order my fill then!\nLet's see...
Well, I guess she is being treated like\na Menace.
Well, I guess since Palaces pop up around\nbad guys, assuming the next ruler could be\nanother Menace isn't much of a reach.
Well, I guess there's no need to worry if\nyou two vouch for 'em.
Well, I guess we should call it a day.\nSee you around, {NAME2}-kun!
Well, I guess you're not badly hurt or\nanything if you're here now...
Well, I hate to impose, but thank you.
Well, I have no conclusive evidence.\nForget I mentioned it.
Well, I have something to do too. Let's do\nthis another time.
Well, I haven't been doing much of anything\nsince I got injured before the last\ncompetition...
Well, I just gotta ask... Why'd you start\nriding crazy on your bike?
Well, I ordered in advance because I thought\nit'd arrive just in time for me to get back.
Well, I seriously can't thank you enough.\nAhaha...
Well, I suppose a hearty bowl of ramen\nwouldn't hurt. That juicy pork... *shlurp*
Well, I suppose they're still not very well known in Japan.
Well, I suppose you're familiar with this by\nnow. As always, we'd appreciate your help\nfinding them.
Well, I sure would love to take ya up there,\nbut I just can't!
Well, I think I'll hit a restaurant and see\nwhat they're offering.
Well, I was certainly shocked the first time\nI saw one of your lunches...
Well, I was wondering if I could make a\ncocktail or mocktail themed around stars.
Well, I wouldn't call it good exactly, but...
Well, I wouldn't say that...
Well, I'm TRYING to read a short story by\nthe great Toshia Soomy, but someone keeps\nchatting to me.
Well, I'm counting on you.
Well, I'm happy you feel that way, but...
Well, I'm here now, so might as well be\nthorough.
Well, I'm not sensing any threats here, so I\nguess we'll be fine.
Well, I'm still just an apprentice...
Well, I'm sure he'll be fine. Who knows,\nmaybe he's looking for us too.
Well, I've got to hand it to you there!\nThat's right, hand-washing and disinfectant.
Well, If you say so...|Let's make it to nationals!
Well, Mr. Higashino has come this far thanks\nto Ritsuka's support.
Well, a) Riko-senpai is a girl, and\nb) you're kinda ham-fisted, Soy.
Well, about that...
Well, all my part-timers quit, so I'll still\nbe out of operation for a while, but...
Well, anyhoo, we should continue\ninvestigating the relationship between the\ntwo of them.
Well, anyone's gonna be a bit wary talking\nto an old lady like me.
Well, anyway, I was just thinking... You two seem very trusting of me, but...
Well, anyway, the roof hideout's a good idea.\nI guarantee no one comes around here at\nlunchtime.
Well, are you sure it's the same guy? Do you have any proof?
Well, aren't you good with numbers?\nYou're right. It's one hundred million.
Well, as I have said, we cannot grant you\nthe answers you seek on this journey.
Well, as promised, I'll teach you a recipe.\nBut we should leave now that we're done\neating.
Well, as the founder of the group, I don't mind giving you a bit more direction.
Well, as you're fully aware...
Well, caring for crops in this world is much\neasier than it is in real life.
Well, catch you later!
Well, come by again when ya feel like\nworkin'.
Well, darlin', I whipped up a bunch of real\nnice surprises just for ya.
Well, do let me know if you change your mind.
Well, do the best you can. I'm right here\nwith you.
Well, drinking till morning's enough to wipe\nyour memory of just about anything.
Well, eat up. Your bowl's on me. Let's talk\nafter it comes.
Well, either way we defeated the enemy. We can talk it over more inside the room just ahead.
Well, excuse me, darlin', but it's not just\nme who benefits from you usin' them machines.\nYou'd regret sitting this one out!
Well, for now I know there's no point\nin worrying.
Well, fortunately, as I grew older my\nphysical health improved.
Well, from my logic... I believe there was\nsomeone pulling his strings from behind\nthe scenes.
Well, from that height, she'll probably live.
Well, go on! Have a bite of whatever\nyou like.
Well, good for them I suppose.
Well, good work today!
Well, he said he just needs to add the\nfinishing touches, so hopefully he'll show\nus next time.
Well, her name's Ryoko, and she's one of my\nfriends from high school.
Well, here's today's pay.
Well, here's what I owe you for today.
Well, his presence was weaker than the\nShadows in Mementos.
Well, how do I put it? I do like flair\nbartending and coming up with recipes, but...
Well, if he wants to join that bad, let him.
Well, if it isn't {NAME2}.\nYou doing all right?
Well, if it stirs up hope in the students,\nthen all the better.
Well, if it's a welcome party, then sure.
Well, if it's lost, it's lost. We'll just\nhave to go back to the real world and ask\nRiko-senpai again.
Well, if that's what I'm doing, I'd better\nplan it out right away!
Well, if they've got something to be\npassionate about, that's amazing in its\nown right.
Well, if we combine them...
Well, if you do ever grow tired of them, I'd\nbe more than happy to welcome you.
Well, if you say so, then... Hmmm?
Well, if you say so...
Well, in short, I'm scouring this area for\nmy ID.
Well, interruption aside, we should continue\nlooking for signs of the Palace.
Well, it appears you found all of the orange\ntabby's treasures hidden in Zoshigaya!
Well, it certainly sounds like she has a bit\nof disdain for this Akashi fellow.
Well, it feels like I might just end up\nmooching off them.
Well, it is the early bird that reaps the\nworm.
Well, it looks like it's cooked through.
Well, it looks like we're running low on\nwater. Maybe they're just trying to flag down\nsome staff?
Well, it seems like someone could benefit\nfrom some assistance!
Well, it sounds like his audition didn't go\nso well...
Well, it wasn't just him, but I guess all\nforeign nations. Sounds like they just\nwanted all of 'em away!
Well, it'd be interesting if that was true,\nbut it'd be pretty difficult, don't you\nthink?
Well, it's a little embarrassing...
Well, it's hardly a plant without a power\nsource like that teacher lady.
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.
Well, it's not flat, and it's not sharp like\na regular blade either.
Well, it's not good to hold onto a grudge!\nI'd rather we fight and make up right after.
Well, it's not just for that. It's also to\nthank you for helping me on that long journey\nto find my ideal flavors.
Well, it's not like I expected him to tell\nthe truth anyway.
Well, it's okay. We're just having burgers.
Well, it's uh... The thing is... This is\nquite difficult to say actually.
Well, it's what you might call my\n"destiny draw."
Well, keep up the good work!
Well, kind of. I'm still in residency.
Well, let's be on our way.
Well, let's be serious here. I don't want to\nteach you, the black-haired beauty.
Well, let's eat. Oh, uh, you gotta really go\nto town when mixin' it, okay?
Well, let's get over there. I'm sure the\nnews about the chain deal's bound to blow\neveryone away.
Well, let's just go and see!
Well, let's just go inside.
Well, let's return home. I'm full simply from\nwatching you...
Well, let's see what they're up to this week.\nMy hands are sweatin' just turnin' the page!
Well, like any treasure, we can expect it to be tightly guarded. Therefore we should focus on learning its location first.
Well, look who it is! The maggots that do their dirty work in the dark!
Well, look who it is. Do you need something,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Well, looks like we need to go higher.\nEveryone, watch your step!
Well, maybe I should've said it's the\natmosphere. It reminds me of my student days.
Well, no matter. I've searched the room, and it seems to be free of danger.
Well, no matter. Of course the process is\nimportant, but this job is about results.
Well, no use ruminating on it.
Well, no way out but through! Ready to tackle\nthe wild world of cr\xeape making,\n{NAME1}-kun!?
Well, no, not really...
Well, not my problem...
Well, nothin' to do but give up and get over it.
Well, now I wanna step there.
Well, now that I know tomorrow's menu, that's\nall for today! Nice and quick!
Well, now that we've reaffirmed our resolve,\nI believe we ought to return to our search.
Well, now, let's go home and get some rest,\nshall we?
Well, okay, fine. Hmmm, what should we\ndo then?
Well, penalty kicks give the kicker an overwhelming advantage, but...
Well, perhaps my explanation is still getting\nahead of itself.
Well, remember we're Phantom Thieves. I'd prefer to keep our true identities under wraps.
Well, see you later.
Well, see you tomorrow!
Well, see you! Hope we get a shift together\nagain sometime.
Well, shall we head back?
Well, shoyu is just called soy sauce in\nEnglish, so how about "Soy"?
Well, since you're only hearing my side\nof the story it may be a little\nsubjective, but...
Well, some kids end up weak to alcohol\neven with parents who drink a lot.
Well, stadiums have spaces for the athletes\nto train in, so this must be one of those\nareas, right?
Well, sugars, what can I say? <color=#FF423F>Marthym</color>'s the\nname, makin' sales is my game! And y'all look\nlike you could benefit from my services.
Well, thanks again for today.
Well, that and... "Bizarre" isn't quite the right word... I suppose you could say he laid his desires bare for all to see.
Well, that decides it. Let's go grab\nsomething to eat right away.
Well, that didn't work...
Well, that does have the name of the river in\nit, so as long as you know where that is...
Well, that hit the spot! Curry is way, way\nbetter with a side of rice.
Well, that took us outside, somehow...
Well, that would make sense. But I did say\nit was a misunderstanding...
Well, that's all over now! I can keep working\nas an idol!
Well, that's dealt with. Let's continue.
Well, that's fine I guess. I'll come along.
Well, that's him. He's a bit odd, but he's a\ngood kid all around.
Well, that's it for today. Everyone,\nget home safe and sound.
Well, that's something to ask your science\nteacher! Okay, back to class!
Well, that's sorted.
Well, that's sorted. Let's make quick work of the rest.
Well, that's the gist of it.
Well, that's the tricky part. While you may\nget a good view of the path ahead by\nclimbing a tree...
Well, that's the very nightmare I'm living\nright now...! Uwaaaaah!
Well, that's to be expected.
Well, the cover's different, but the inside's\nexactly the same.
Well, the first thing we have to do is\nfigure out who the next Palace ruler is,\nright?
Well, the owner came by and left this here.
Well, the they seem to have departed.
Well, then, if it's not too much trouble,\nplease take this!
Well, then, that concludes the grand tour!\nAnd as always, thank you for your patronage.
Well, then, that's perfect.
Well, then, which will it be?
Well, there happen to be some irresistibly\ncute <color=#FF423F>Shichi-kun capsule toys</color> available now!
Well, there's no way to know now, since\nhe's gone.
Well, things are about to get a lot busier\nfor me! I've got to be a good wife, a good\nauntie...
Well, this is a larger area.
Well, this is hard to say, but...
Well, this is the first time I'm seein' one\nof these, so... bear with me while I figure\nout how to explain it!
Well, this is your time to shine, Kurosawa. Don't let us down, ace!
Well, to summarize, if that's Akashi's\ncognitive being...
Well, um, an acoustic guitar arrangement of a\nsong my old bandmates and I wrote.
Well, umm... Let's just call that the\nrashness of youth. Sorry about all that.
Well, unlike Madarame's Palace, we haven't\nseen much of Kaneshiro's...
Well, until next time.
Well, until you do, I'll think up a temporary\nname for you!
Well, wake yourself up. I ain't gonna help if\nyou nod off in class.
Well, want to head out on a neighborhood\npatrol?
Well, we do want information.|We'll at least hear you out.
Well, we don't actually know if it's a\nfour-digit number either.
Well, we got surrounded by these armored\nshadows and got the crap beat out of us.
Well, we haven't even pinned down where\nKaneshiro's Treasure is.
Well, we should head home. Let's walk to the\nstation together to avoid getting distracted\nwith unnecessary pitstops.
Well, we wanna beat Nanjo, right? Gotta keep workin' hard.
Well, we're here to have fun and take it\neasy. So don't push yourself too hard!
Well, we're in. Let's just hurry and find a\nway out of here.
Well, we've got a surprise for you.
Well, whatever! What matters is that I said\nhello, right?
Well, whatever. Anyways, I heard there's\na really nice pachinko machine here,\nso I came to check it out.
Well, whatever. I'm <color=#FF423F>Taiko Saito</color>.\nDrums.
Well, when she's worried about her students,\nshe can't just throw 'em to the lions.\nShe's not that kinda person.
Well, when you put it that way, I suppose\na survey of the entire park is highly\nwarranted.
Well, when you put it that way, there's\nreally no other path forward, is there?
Well, white is made from only the new buds\nof the plant, and it's light and refreshing.
Well, who's to say.
Well, will you do it for me?
Well, yeah. I mean, you're the one who can fly, right?
Well, yeah. Nobody listened to her.
Well, yeah. That's 'cause we've never met\nbefore.
Well, yes, but...
Well, yes, that is one of the organs\nassociated most with feelings of\ngreat sadness.
Well, you don't have to go quite that far...\nBut surely your understanding of how to\ncharm others has expanded.
Well, you see, I've got this idea I wanna\ntry out...
Well, you see, workin' on my body taught me\nhow to listen to my muscles.
Well, you see...
Well, you see... My parents kicked me out of\nthe house... Those idiots...
Well, you tried, and that's what counts.\nThe answer is actually astronomy.
Well, you'll find out after you have a taste.
Well, you're right about that.
Well, you've got plenty of both style and\nsubstance. Just need to learn how to show it!
Well, {NAME1}? Feeling up to the challenge?
Well, {NAME2}. I think I was a bit na\xefve\nabout this.
Well. Either way, we beat them and\neveryone's still okay.
Well...
Well... At first glance, it looks like a\nrun-of-the-mill shoyu ramen.
Well... I can't say any more about it here\nat school.
Well... I do realize that drinking all day won't really do me a lick of good, of course.
Well... I suppose that could be true as well?\nI'm not an expert on bees.
Well... I was planning to. This paper is my\nstreet performance permit.
Well... I'm afraid it's not for me to say.
Well... I'm sorry, I'm afraid it's still up\nin the air...
Well... I've been worried about you for a\nlong time now...
Well... If I'm feeling down again, I hope\nyou'll be there for me again.
Well... It's a street performance permit.\nThe city's been pretty strict about having\nthem lately.
Well... It's true that the committee has been\ncalled upon a lot more lately.
Well... Just be careful not to be rude\nto him, okay? That's all.
Well... Lately I have had trouble knowing\nwhat to do with all the flowers I've been\ngetting.
Well... News travels fast. Like news of how\nyou managed to whip up a bowl that left a\ncertain someone lost for words.
Well... No matter. We are business partners\nnow. Let's do our best to understand each\nother better.
Well... Now that you mention it...
Well... Our little sesh today confirmed it,\nbut I've had an inkling for a while.
Well... So like I told you before, I've got this grandchild.
Well... That's not incorrect per se, but I'm\nnot sure that description will do him\nany good.
Well... To be completely frank, I am. Not to\nmention my arm's kind of...
Well... When your heart has strengthened through bonds with others, we will summon you again.
Well... all right then.
Well... no matter. You must still be\nconfused.
Well... yeah...
Well...?
Well? Are you feeling prepared?
Well? Feel free to be brutally honest with\nyour feedback.
Well? How d'you like that!?
Well? What now?
Well? What'd you think?
Well? What's it gonna be? You gonna make me\nsome authentic broth or not?
Welp, bye.
Welp, g'luck kids. Byeee!
Welp, let's get cooking! Lessee: first, saut\xe9\nthe dry ingredients, creating a... donut\nshape?
Welp, let's go find that Treasure, huh? For\nPops and Masa-san too.
Welp, we got ourselves an arms dealer.
Were more people hoping to see me go through\npain and suffering in rehabilitation?
Were my words too harsh?
Were that demon to rise again, we would be\nforced to... c-call the police?
Were they happy?
Were they trying to betray my expectations?\nWell, now I don't expect ANYTHING from them!
Were you talking about investigating\nMr. Akashi?
Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? A robot that attacks\nother robots!? I believe this is what we call\na Berserk Bot!
Wh-Wh-What are you lackeys waiting for!?\nDispose of them!
Wh-Wh-What are you!? Some sort of mascot!? Wait... Black hood... Yellow eyes... Are you a hooded ghost!?
Wh-Wh-What're you gawking at!? Grab that\nuseless teacher!
Wh-Wh-Whoooah! Puh-Puh-Panther!\nYou know we're in public, right!?
Wh-Wha\u2014 Shun!
Wh-Whaaat!? Just like that?
Wh-What am I supposed to do? The conference\nis coming up soon!
Wh-What is that? A giant pink...pig?
Wh-What the hell!?
Wh-What!?
Wh-What!? Hm... Maybe I should take you\nup on that?
Wh-What!? Incredible! You actually finished\nthat huge bowl of ramen!
Wh-What!? Wonder, be careful going forward!
Wh-What's going on here!?
Wh-What's going on!?
Wh-What's going on...!?
Wh-What's with this suit?
Wh-What? If you've got something to say, say it.
Wh-When you say that, do you... did you\nreally mean it that way?
Wh-Where did you learn to do this!?
Wh-Why not? I don't solely subsist on ramen,\ny'know!
Wh... What is that!? Is it... a human?
Wh... {NAME1}-san!? I was most certain we\nwere comrades.
Wha!? Worried? O-Oh... I made you worry, huh?
Wha...
Wha... 
Wha... going...? ...Losing...\nsignal...
Wha...!? A drawer just popped out of\nthe wall!
Wha...?
Wha\u2014 An alarm!?
Wha\u2014 Don't shout like that. We're in\nenemy territory.
Wha\u2014 How\u2014 Huh!?
Wha\u2014 Uh... Wait. So...
Wha\u2014 What!?
Wha\u2014 Why? Seriously, what the heck's going\non here?
Wha\u2014! The boss is truly formidable!
Wha\u2014!?
Wha\u2014!? An enemy!? Damn! I can't believe\nI didn't notice it approaching!
Wha\u2014!? How can you say that, {NAME2}!?

Why does that feel like a dig at me?
Why does trouble follow me wherever I go!?
Why don't I jog your memory?
Why don't we go there together sometime?
Why don't we head back to Miyazawa's Palace\nand try exploring even deeper?
Why don't we let him decide? He probably\nknows more than we do.
Why don't we look around and stop to nibble\non anything that looks yummy along the way?

Why don't you show me your aim?
Why fight it this much!?
Why her?|Naruru might quit?
Why indeed. Well, my thoughts are...
Why investigate him?|Work together how?
Why is he having you compile this kind of\ndata? It has nothing to do with the students.
Why is he scattering it around like that?\nWhat's going on?
Why is it so important to behave exactly how\nsomeone else expects you to?
Why is that?|That's no good.|Who needs to study?

Why not?|You can't tell her yourself?
Why such a thought is abundant here...\nI do not know.
Why the hell are exams even a thing?\nLike, seriously...
Why the look of distrust?

Why, I would not dare miss it. After all,\nyou are my one and only, Naruru.
Why, for your very first tool, this is\nexpertly made.
Why, hello there, sugar. Welcome!
Why, is there a spirit living in there or something?
Why, it's a wonderful idea if I do say so\nmyself!
Why, just looking at these healthy potatoes\nmakes me feel so much better!
Why, of course!
Why, of course. Well... perhaps I cannot say\nthat truthfully.
Why, oh why, have people turned away\nfrom prayer?
Why, potatoes, of course!
Why, steaks, of course. Thick-cut and\ncooked rare... *shlurp*
Why, thank you, young man. I'm a little lost and need directions.
Why, you're already a service expert.
Why...?
Why...? Why are you defending me...?

Wish we could help.|Is there anything we can do?|Let's go help her!
With Goemon by my side!
With Katayama's Shadow gone, the dam must\nbe low on power.
With Kiuchi's Palace, you were able to sense it somehow, weren't you, Cattle?
With Kiuchi, there was a lot of public attention on his erratic behavior.
With Miyazawa, you said you found him by\nlistening for his full name, right?
With Nishimori here, the puzzles will be\neasy-peasy. What do we get if we win?
With Riko Tanemura here, we can't allow\nourselves to get caught up in a battle!

With all my classwork? I don't have the time!
With all of our strength training, my muscles\nare lookin' pretty in shape now...
With all of the flowers floating around, you\ncan really enjoy this tea before you even\ntake the first sip.
With all of this we could even make\nsomething besides curry. I'm sure Ryuji\nwill be happy.
With all these books here, I expected there'd\nbe more students.
With anything less than the approval of every member, we do nothing.
With art, I don't know enough of the basics\nto be able to tell.

With our powers combined, we've overcome the\ncurse of the Evil AV Room!
With plenty of trial and\nerror, the kids and I worked\nthrough the puzzle.
With roasted pork.|Rice and extra noodles.|Plain.
With so few customers about these days, I'd\nbe plum crazy not to take this opportunity!
With so many people who speak English, would an English speaker really bother?
With such focus, you'll make it to the final\nlevel in no time!
With that hint... No, that's not right...\nThat wouldn't fit with the\nhorizonal answer...
With that in mind, having them all on an\napp makes it way more convenient. I can\nread anywhere!
With that knowledge, do you still want to proceed?
With that... Merope, please offer our guest\nyour support. You understand your\nassignment, yes?
With the Core in our possession, whatever\nwas preventing our escape seems to have\ndissipated.
With the Persona you have brought, I have\ncome to understand you further.

With the power of the sun in my hands, your fate is sealed. Prepare to die!
With the powers we've already taken, maybe\nwe're prepared to face <color=#FF423F>his lordship</color>.
With the rate we're going, I'd like to start\npracticing our competition song.
With the room all to myself,\nI sang up a storm at karaoke.

With trained eyes and skills, can the shinobi\nconquer the castle and reclaim their honor?
With you at my side, I'm unstoppable!
With you being a high school student,\nwe won't be getting in here.
With you on our side, the national stadium\nis more than just a pipe dream. I know\nthat much for sure.
With you?|Why?
Within the vast bounds of Mementos exist locations manifested from the warped desires of certain individuals.
Without all of you, I couldn't have hacked\nAkashi's PC. It's the least I can do.
Without her Treasure inside, the Palace\nmay start to collapse.
Without his great discovery recognized, he\nsuccumed to a mental breakdown, eventually\ndying of a bacterial infection...
Without it, I burn as red as a\nboiled lobster!
Without me here to teach you the value\nof the law...
Without the law, you'd have far worse things\nto worry about.
Without you, we'd still be going round in circles with our silly quarrels.
Witness my power.
Witness the might of Kiyoshi Kurotani!
Witnesses? I was too careless.
Witnessing the fruits of our labor as a\nteam? Not a bad suggestion. I'll join you.
Woah! This is crazy!
Woman! Give I, the Great Cupid,\nyour power!
Women can be quite persuasive, you see.
Women these days up on their high horses cry\nsexual harassment the second you try to talk\nto them.
Won't make much difference adding one more tenant.
Wonder
Wonder and I have fought that Shadow before.
Wonder and I would be desireless, and not to mention pummeled by Shadows.
Wonder what he's got to say this week.\nCan't wait to find out!
Wonder!
Wonder! Oh, and everyone else is here too!\nPhew, I'm glad you're all okay!
Wonder! Strike them down!
Wonder! Watch out!
Wonder! You came at the perfect time, man!
Wonder, Cattle, Closer, Soy... How did you\nall decide on your names?
Wonder, begin the investigation.
Wonder, could we discuss something?
Wonder, eyes on the road please.
Wonder, follow me!
Wonder, go take out that <color=#FF423F>Shadow</color> and get\nthe key.
Wonder, huh? You kinda remind me of\na friend of mine.
Wonder, let's depart as soon as you're ready.
Wonder, let's go check the <color=#FF423F>Castle Gates</color>.
Wonder, let's head back to the real world.
Wonder, let's keep an eye out for places to\nuse this card as we proceed.
Wonder, let's use our infiltration tool. We'll get in through that duct.
Wonder, look at that!
Wonder, look out!\nThe fire is still burning here!
Wonder, no! These aren't opponents you\ncan fend off on your own\u2014
Wonder, perhaps we should search this area\nagain?
Wonder, perhaps your powers of observation\nmay be able to spot something?
Wonder, please search the area.
Wonder, prepare for battle!
Wonder, prioritizing your targets is critical!
Wonder, something about this place... It\ndoesn't feel right.
Wonder, stop...!
Wonder, take out that Shadow. If this goes well, we'll have a safe place to rest inside the Palace.
Wonder, that includes you! Phantom Thieves\nare professionals at infiltration!\nYelling is...!
Wonder, the shutter over there just opened!
Wonder, the treasure chest has materialized!
Wonder, there should be a <color=#FF423F>power box</color>\nnear here. Let's look for it.
Wonder, there's a switch here.
Wonder, to battle!
Wonder, use your knife to cut us out\nof here!
Wonder, wait!
Wonder, wait. I sense intense malice here.\nBe careful.
Wonder, we can't get through this way!
Wonder, we need to hit each enemy in its weakness. Give us your orders.
Wonder, what should we do first?
Wonder, would you care to do the honors?
Wonder, you know what to do.
Wonder, you may be able to jump on top of the\n<color=#FF423F>wooden shelves</color> over there.
Wonder-senpai, have you ever tried that\neating challenge at the burger shop?
Wonder.
Wonder?
Wonderful! Let's head over.
Wonderful! Shall we head inside? You can order whatever you'd like!
Wonderful! Thank you so much.
Wonderful, {NAME1}-san! I'm glad we're on\nthe same page.
Wonderful. I'll be on my way home then.\nI look forward to the next time we meet.
Wonderful. Well, until then.
Woo! I feel as good as I did in my league days. How 'bout a li'l charm 'n' cheer?
Woo! Strike one!
Woo! Then it's settled.
Wood.|Rock.|Cement.
Woof! Woof! Hooray! Welcome to Shibuya!
Woof! Woof! Hooray! Welcome to Shibuya!\nHave a paw-some time!

Woohoohoo...
Wooow. Call me a turkey, 'cause I'm stuffed!\nThat was... the greatest few hours of my\nlife.
Word choice is critical in every language.
Word on the street says Menaces are lurking\naround every corner. At least with strong\nmedicine you can relax a little, right?
Word order, how the sentence subject works...\nEvery little thing seems different.\nAnd yet...
Word up! We were just talking about\nKotone-chan's sense of style!
Words cannot do justice to how thankful I am.\nI will cherish this wonderful day forever.
Work and sweat together for a fantastic\nbonding experience, guaranteed!
Work often, yes. Here, not always... But we\nwork in a lot of shops around Shibuya\nStation.
Work?|What are you gonna make me do?
Workbench?|What do we need that for?
Working a customer service job is certainly\none way to spread kindness, no?
Working hard?|What are you doing?|Pumping up the potatoes?
Working together with Tomoko,\nthe shift went off without\na hitch.
Working together with your buddy... Ain't\nyouth grand!
Working various jobs has most certainly\nhelped polish your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.

Working with others is truly enlightening.\nIt would be worthwhile to come back.
Working with others is truly enlightening.\nIt would behoove us to come back,\nwouldn't you agree?
Worried about a rival?|Can't lose to her.
Worry not. There is a way forward.
Worst case scenario, it could kill Kamoshida.
Worthless scum! You can't even scratch me!
Would it be all right if I stepped out to\ncall my coach for a minute? Then I'd like to\nmeet those brass band friends of yours.
Would that idea have been so wrong?|Was that really all you wanted?
Would things have gone differently if we'd\nbeen able to take down the Palace?
Would this be inconvenient for you?
Would ya look at that! You finished washing\nall those bowls. I knew I could count on you.
Would you be so kind as to help an old\nman out?
Would you be up for that now? If you have\ntime, of course.
Would you girls mind moving this chat to the cafeteria?
Would you happen to have any yellow tea,\nor perhaps pu'er tea?
Would you happen to have any, um, chamomile?\nI'd like to make a bouquet out of some.
Would you like to come with us?
Would you like to go?
Would you like to hang out with me? I'd like\nto learn more about what teens are into these\ndays.
Would you like to head straight back there now, Wonder?
Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
Would you like to walk home together?
Would you like to work together on this?
Would you mind accompanying me to the caf\xe9?
Would you mind being on the register?
Would you mind going to the burger shop with\nmy friend?
Would you mind if I took a moment of\nyour time?
Would you two be in the mood for a meal by\nany chance? My treat! As thanks for that\npasta.
Would you two become my emotional support\ncoaches!? I'm absolutely serious!
Would you two mind waiting out here?
Would you want someone staring at you while you're all banged and bruised up? Motoha is being considerate by keeping you out.
Wouldn't dream of it! But she will have to\ninherit her family's business someday...
Wouldn't it be easier for the both of us if I\njust stopped tiptoeing around it?
Wouldn't it be fun if everyone here played\na round against each other?
Wouldn't you agree?
Wow!
Wow! Amazing! That's right!
Wow! I'd love to go there!
Wow! That's a great idea, Sensei! You've got\nthe answers for everything.
Wow! That's great!

Wow, Mr. Akashi handled that really well.\nGuess he's pretty reliable, huh?
Wow, Yukimi-san. You sure know a bunch about\ntea ceremonies.
Wow, are you sure you're a high schooler,\n{NAME2}-chan? You need to seriously\ntake a chill pill.

Wow, we were totally in sync!
Wow, you finished the Universe-sized Ramen\nagain!
Wow, you know quite a lot about this place.
Wow, you're a fan of Moe-chan too?
Wow, you're amazing! I was too scared to\ngo anywhere near them...
Wow, {NAME2}-kun! This monja's perfect!
Wow. For a small store, it sure has a lot of\noptions.
Wow. That's Mr. Akashi for you.\nHis prep work is second to none!
Wow...
Wow... I don't know what to say... Sorry,\nI might get a li'l teary!
Wow... I knew about the dome, but I didn't\nknow there was a park like this too.
Wow... So phantom thief outfits outfit can\nchange like that.
Wow... That was beautiful! Thanks for tagging\nalong, by the way.
Wow... What a view. This really is the\nmodern-day Tower of Babel.
Wow... You'd really let me have such a\nwonderful gift?
Wrap the cr\xeape|Put in the strawberries|Put in the cream|Wrap with paper
Wrapped in the comforts of\ncoffee, I feel like I've\ndiscovered something...
Wrong! But now that you mention it, I\nwouldn't mind one of those right now...
Wrong! Did you even try to use your brain?\nThe correct answer is the one-yen coin.
Wrong, wrong, stupid, wrong! Ohhh, nothin's\nbetter than teachin' those girls a lesson!\nI'll put 'em in their places!
Wrong. For starters, the gender doesn't even\nmatch. The correct answer is\nArtemisia Gentileschi.
Wrong...?
Wrong?|What did you remember?
Y'know what, sugar? I'm gonna need your help\nto turn this into a gorgeous gallery burstin'\nwith beautiful snippets from your life!
Y'know, find some finishes beforehand that\nstill let a chef guarantee it'll taste good.

Yaoling and I hung out at the\nSkytree. Neither of us had\nseen an aqua bus before!
Yaoling and I hung out at the\nSkytree. The glasswork and\ncandy craft screamed Edo...
Yaoling and I hung out at the\nSkytree. We browsed various\ndelicacies from across Japan.
Yaoling and I hung out at the\nSkytree. We counted all the\ntower-shaped souvenirs...
Yaoling and I made plans for\nour next tea party...
Yaoling and I searched till we\nfound the shop she was\nlooking for.
Yaoling and I spent some time\nalone together...
Yaoling and I stopped at\nHeritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya\nfor Sichuan-style mapo tofu.
Yaoling and I stopped by the\ndry cleaners in Zoshigaya. She\ngave me tips about laundry...
Yaoling and I visited a bakery\nin Zoshigaya. We sampled the\ncustard buns.
Yaoling and I visited the\nchurch in Kanda. A solemn pipe\norgan tune filled the air...
Yaoling and I visited the\nchurch in Kanda. I couldn't\ntell her what the hymns meant.
Yaoling and I visited the\nchurch in Kanda. She took a\nliking to the angel statue...
Yaoling and I visited the\nchurch in Kanda. The stained\nglass cast a pretty light...
Yaoling and I visited the\nchurch in Kanda. We asked\nabout the architecture...
Yaoling and I wandered around\nShimo-Kitazawa until a funky\ncaf\xe9 caught our eye...
Yaoling and I wandered around\nShimo-Kitazawa, dipping in\nand out of the antique shops.
Yaoling and I wandered around\nShimo-Kitazawa, perusing the\nsecondhand clothes shops...
Yaoling and I wandered around\nShimo-Kitazawa. We caught an\nold movie's special screening.
Yaoling and I wandered around\nShimo-Kitazawa. We sampled\na bunch of new donuts...
Yaoling and I went back to\nmy place.
Yaoling asked me questions\nabout Japanese that she's\nbeen wondering about...
Yaoling dragged me around the\ntasty food shops, searching\nfor the perfect snack...
Yaoling is staring at me\nwith a look of confusion\non her face...
Yaoling taught me a recipe...
Yaoling told me how much she\nlooks forward to our next\nchurch visit on the way home.
Yaoling's words made me\nstart viewing this dish in\na different light...
Yaoling, Chizuko and I talked\nabout maturing with age...
Yaoling, Yumi, and I talked\nabout Chinese tea-based\nmocktails...
Yaoling-san. The tea ceremony is a\nconversation between the proprietor and\nthe customer.
Yay!
Yay! I can't wait!
Yay! I get to taste Victory Ramen again. I can't wait!
Yay! Off we go!
Yay! Then I'll cut right to the chase...
Yay, I'm so happy! Thanks for coming!
Yay, juice! Thanks, I'm gonna drink this,\nthen practice some more.
Yay, yay, yay! What should we do then!?
Yay. Look at us, {NAME1}-chan and Merope.\nTwo peas in a pod.
Yeah I am. No way am I lettin' you pay.
Yeah right!
Yeah!
Yeah! And if we'd made even the tiniest\nmistake, she could've died!
Yeah! Boy, it makes me mad just thinking\nabout it. Let's go snatch that Treasure from\nKiuchi right now!
Yeah! Breaking it would make exploring\neasier, right?
Yeah! Check it out! The Killer Cayenne\nCrunch! Hehe, just messing with you.
Yeah! How many songs do you think we'll get\nthrough?
Yeah! I bet if word got out about what he's doing, the public would eat him alive!
Yeah! I like you too, Riko-senpai!
Yeah! I was hoping you'd say that!
Yeah! If these guys are rotten to the core...\nWe'll just have to cut that rot out!
Yeah! If you say so, {NAME2}, I actually\nfeel like I can!
Yeah! Let's do it!
Yeah! Like boiled eggs, or roasted pork... So how do you like your ramen, {NAME2}?
Yeah! Minami-chan's busy.
Yeah! Of course.
Yeah! Thanks! Believe me, I'm just getting\nstarted.
Yeah! There're no Shadows around. This is\nour chance!
Yeah! There's no way I can lose! Wait,\nall-rounder? Am I pitching and batting!?
Yeah! Today's the last day of the special. If\nwe don't eat it now, we'll "rigate" it later!
Yeah! Watch me! I'm gonna keep growing!
Yeah! We have to change Akashi's heart\nbefore more people get hurt!
Yeah! We'll knock it out of the park!
Yeah! Whatever Kiuchi's twisted desires are,\nwe've got to steal them away!
Yeah!|I'm counting on you.
Yeah!|No, sorry...
Yeah!|You said it!
Yeah, "cool" is the word that really\ndescribes me! Of course cute isn't really me.
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah, I agree. Being able to enjoy\nrestaurant-level quality from a convenience\nstore sounds nice.
Yeah, I am.|Not right now, sorry...
Yeah, I am.|Sorry, maybe another time?
Yeah, I asked him for cooking tips and he\nwas really patient explaining everything!
Yeah, I can do this! That vending machine\nsold me some courage!
Yeah, I can really get a feel for Sensei's\neveryday high school life here!
Yeah, I can see that! You're improving at\nan impressive rate.
Yeah, I can't believe she could cycle all the\nway to the dam!
Yeah, I can't call you that...
Yeah, I can't really ask you to decide this\nfor me.
Yeah, I collect them.|Not really.
Yeah, I do... It's like the sound of a river\nor a waterfall, right?
Yeah, I don't really eith\u2014noooo!!!
Yeah, I don't wanna deal with any of that.\nThat's why I leave the house early.
Yeah, I don't wanna just hit her with a\ndrive-by apology. We need to sit down and\nhash things out.
Yeah, I doubt he'll follow through on his promise to leave the shop alone...
Yeah, I figured there were none around here.
Yeah, I get pretty hungry after using\nmy head.
Yeah, I guess I did mention how jasmine tea's\ngood for that.
Yeah, I guess not anymore...
Yeah, I have to do this properly. I'll need\nto make an opportunity to apologize and talk\nit out.
Yeah, I heard from Masa-san afterward.
Yeah, I heard the manager's a big hit.\nThe coffee's supposed to be pretty good,\ntoo, but...
Yeah, I knew you'd say that!
Yeah, I know how much you were rooting for\nme. Sorry to let you down.
Yeah, I know! Anyway, where'd Joker and\nPanther disappear to?
Yeah, I know. I was one step from getting\nthe cops called on me. Good thing they left\nit out of the TV broadcast.
Yeah, I like your moxie!
Yeah, I suppose. Sorry. I just thought I\ncould support the team like you do, Oracle.
Yeah, I think if I'm with you, it won't feel\nas much like I'm on my way to work.
Yeah, I think you're right! If things keep\ngoing like this, then one day...!
Yeah, I thought so... But I do recognize that\nin myself, you know.
Yeah, I tried calling out at the shop front\nbut it looks like he's round the back...
Yeah, I used to be in a band. I've been into\nmusic ever since.
Yeah, I'm able to go to school again starting today.
Yeah, I'm free.|I'm a little busy right now...
Yeah, I'm free.|Today's a bit tight.
Yeah, I'm gonna head back and hit the hay.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing it for\nreal at the station square.
Yeah, I'm ready.|I need to get ready.
Yeah, I'm really glad we did that. Taiko and\nTsurumi are on board now too.
Yeah, I've got time.|I'm busy...
Yeah, Katayama-san's an amazing teacher!
Yeah, Kiuchi had a lot of victims... and everyone knew the Subway Slammer.
Yeah, Kiuchi's too. Thanks for that,\nMeta Nav.
Yeah, a good friend who watches my back in\nbattl\u2014 Batting practice, and stuff...
Yeah, ain't it the best? But y'know, my\nyakitori's extra special!
Yeah, basically.
Yeah, but I dropped my notebook that had\nthe password in it!
Yeah, but I'm the vice president, not some\nerrand girl. What a pain. Haha...
Yeah, but Shun was justified. It seemed like\nMiyazawa was trying to hurt our shop.
Yeah, but it sure would be nice to win\nthe top prize and stay in bed the rest\nof my life though...
Yeah, but that's actually why I was able to\nbe completely honest with her about this.
Yeah, but this area seems like it's gonna\nbe a real pain to get through. Looks like\nthere's even more obstacles...
Yeah, comparing the different flavors was so\nmuch fun! My favorite was... Agh, I\ncan't choose!
Yeah, exactly. He goes by "Katana Tongue" something or other. His palate is said to be unquestionable.
Yeah, fair enough. Here's hoping she heard\nwhat I had to say.
Yeah, fine by me.
Yeah, for real. You didn't ask us to chase\nafter you.
Yeah, for sure!
Yeah, for sure. I should find my own path\nwithout comparing myself to others.
Yeah, hard to believe just how many victims\nhe had... Ugh.
Yeah, he said he was "curious about the\nflavor" at our snack party.
Yeah, he's someone you always end up\nrelying on. I guess you could call him\nour leader.
Yeah, hearing about him did make me wonder\nif all of 'em take money to lie about food.
Yeah, how is it visible already? We didn't\neven send out a calling card yet.
Yeah, it is. My sister is still young, so I\nhave to do my best for her.
Yeah, it's all over the internet.
Yeah, it's been a while so I don't think\nnow's the right time to get stuck in.
Yeah, it's crowded, but looks like a table just opened up! "Misfortune" my foot! This is our lucky day!
Yeah, it's great here! It's one of my\nfavorite running spots too.
Yeah, it's me.|I go by Wonder here.
Yeah, it's not like I get what Mona is,\neither. I guess some creatures naturally\nhave googly eyes.
Yeah, jasmine tea.|I used something more relaxing.
Yeah, just like that, perfect!
Yeah, let's do this.
Yeah, let's have some fun and go get some\nchow.
Yeah, let's roll!
Yeah, little league practice.
Yeah, look at me as a person.|Gotta respect diversity.
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah, me neither. Maybe I'll skip.
Yeah, me too!
Yeah, never mind...
Yeah, not going. Art's not my thing.
Yeah, nothing beats strength in numbers.
Yeah, now Kiuchi's\nin a total slump\nbecause of it.
Yeah, now that we've made it this far...
Yeah, of course you do! Everyone does! Right?
Yeah, of course!
Yeah, of course! We can all get together and\nhave a study party!
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, on a crowded train.|Time on a plane never flies by.
Yeah, one sec.
Yeah, our quest to develop my palate and\nPops's fried rice gave me the idea.
Yeah, right! Like you could! If I lost that, I'd...!
Yeah, same here! Whenever they have one\non TV, I never miss it.
Yeah, see you. I'm gonna stick around for a\nbit. Come say hi if you're free later.
Yeah, seems like he got hurt during the baseball clinic.
Yeah, she's the kid I was talking about. The\none with the strict diet!
Yeah, sounds good to me.
Yeah, that happens a lot when you're taking\nsnapshots, too.
Yeah, that looks good. Should get some good\nbuzz! Now, what to write...
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. We just\ngot through a pretty tough fight, after all.
Yeah, that was sketchy with a capital S.\nThink he was up to something?
Yeah, that'll give me time to prepare... Er,\nnot that destiny requires preparation!
Yeah, that's a normal reaction, I think.
Yeah, that's exactly it. You're pretty good\nat firing back at someone.
Yeah, that's it! About my nephew not carrying\na wallet.
Yeah, that's the kind of thing I can get behind.
Yeah, that's the one. Apparently, the Subway\nSlammer was actually targeting Arai!
Yeah, that's the spirit! That's what I expect\nfrom my apprentice! Heh!
Yeah, that's the spirit. Thanks, you're a\nhuge help.
Yeah, the award in that frame might actually\nbe a little different from ours...
Yeah, the company that sells umeboshi and\npickled goods. Their ads are on TV all the\ntime. You guys haven't heard of it?
Yeah, the whole "could kill him" part...
Yeah, there was! This place is just like it,\nso maybe it has the same kind of room?
Yeah, there's no need for you to worry\nyourself sick over us!
Yeah, they're pretty good, but I still think\ncoming here every day is a bit much...
Yeah, though I just met him recently.\nApparently he lives in the neighborhood?
Yeah, true. Not like it's a problem if we can\njust take them all out!
Yeah, two more. Just when we were about\nto regroup, we were surrounded by bad\nguys again.
Yeah, we talked.|He told me about his past.
Yeah, we won't have a repeat of the potato\nincident on my watch.
Yeah, we'll find them for sure!
Yeah, we're super close. But... this Kiuchi\npunk shoved her onto the train tracks.
Yeah, what a scumbag. I'll cheer you on!
Yeah, yeah, that's the spirit! We've gotta\nlove Shibuya more and more!
Yeah, you did say that in your feedback,\ndidn't you?
Yeah, you might be right.|I'm a bit of a cineaste myself.
Yeah, you should start there. The place you\nwanted to go back most.
Yeah, you'd better!
Yeah, you're beet red.|I get to see a new side of you.
Yeah, you're right. I like lyrics that are\nfull of what the singer's trying to say too.
Yeah, you're right. It was nice to see that\nsmile on her face.
Yeah, you're right. It's less than half the\nprice you pay at the restaurant.
Yeah, you're right. It's not like I support\nteams just to get into fights over them.
Yeah, you're right. No point in any of this\nif I back down now.
Yeah, you're right. Okay, then let's get back\nto finding everyone!
Yeah, you're right. Slow and steady wins\nthe race.
Yeah, you're right... I went a bit too hard\nout the gate.
Yeah.
Yeah. All of my friends were okay, and we\nhave you to thank for that.
Yeah. Anything's worth trying. So, you're in,\nright?
Yeah. But how are we gonna do that? Should we\ntry asking the other teachers?
Yeah. Even if I did quit medicine, you would\nstill see me firing away on that arcade game.
Yeah. Guess it's best to trust our\nidentities are safe and stick to business\nas usual.
Yeah. Hey, thanks for that.
Yeah. Hmph, nice of you to remember.
Yeah. I always can.
Yeah. I certainly have more motivation to\ncontinue with this project.
Yeah. I don't even know how to go about\nbuying fancy stuff in the first place.
Yeah. I don't really know your history with\nthem, but they didn't seem like good guys\nfrom where we were standing.
Yeah. I mean, I'm still in training though.
Yeah. I think I've been pretending I didn't care just to cope with everything. But not anymore.
Yeah. I think this must be about the\nFood Fight!
Yeah. I thought it was 'cause she used to\nride her bike there like Masa-san said.
Yeah. I wanna join the Phantom Thieves.
Yeah. I was blown away when I first tried the ramen here...
Yeah. I won't give up anymore!
Yeah. I'll slack off if I train alone,\nso he's here to supervise me.
Yeah. I'm still gettin' used to fighting, and\nI don't want to drag you guys down...
Yeah. I'm sure it won't disappoint.
Yeah. I'm totally fine now.
Yeah. I'm very grateful...
Yeah. If I'm being honest, it's not like I\ndidn't want to keep going.
Yeah. If anything, it's the total opposite.
Yeah. It looks just like Kaneshiro's Palace.\nThe one we were just infiltrating!
Yeah. It takes a while before you get the\nhang of it.
Yeah. It's a little complicated, though...
Yeah. Lately, I've been thinking...
Yeah. Really tough.
Yeah. She did say she was really looking\nforward to seeing her video and photo,\nat least.
Yeah. She's the reason we found out about\nthe Food Fight announcement in the\nfirst place.
Yeah. Still though... That last line from him\nsure was a clich\xe9 villain quip, huh.
Yeah. Thanks!
Yeah. That's the right attitude, young man.
Yeah. The police won't do anything about\nthem, so that leaves it to the\nPhantom Thieves.
Yeah. There's still no sign of Joker, Queen,\nor Closer...
Yeah. They must be connected somehow, but\nseems like they weren't fellow delinquents.
Yeah. Tomoko told me. Apparently he's not\na regular teacher.
Yeah. We have to stop him from doing that\nFood Fight and falling into Miyazawa's trap.
Yeah. We have to take back their desires and make Miyazawa confess to his crimes.
Yeah. We were battery mates in little league.
Yeah. Who knows how many years it'll be\nuntil I can really make it happen, though.
Yeah. You hang in there too, Ryoko.
Yeah. You know how I used to play\nin little league?
Yeah. You know what? You're exactly right.
Yeah. You're right. It's my decision to make.\nI'll...
Yeah...
Yeah... Akashi interrupted us when we were\ntalking to Katayama-san on the roof.
Yeah... Fist of the Phantom Star...
Yeah... For now, that's about all we can do.
Yeah... I am really starving.
Yeah... I don't think there was anything\nwrong with taking the picture.
Yeah... I guess that's true.
Yeah... I guess you have a point. I know! I'll put the shop up for Divine Justice too.
Yeah... I guess you're right. Well then, I'll\ngive it my best shot!
Yeah... I guess you're right...
Yeah... I have to be upfront and express\nmyself clearly. It's not just about getting\nforgiveness.
Yeah... I know part of me's projecting my own\nworries onto her, but still...
Yeah... I know.
Yeah... I mean, no.
Yeah... I might be a problem, so I'll teach\nyou how to take care of me, okay?
Yeah... I never really thought about it, but\nI'd say I prefer bright and uplifting stories.
Yeah... I really like her style.
Yeah... I think he's right.
Yeah... I think that could work.
Yeah... I was thinking the same thing!\nBut, then again... Aahhh...
Yeah... I worried her constantly and didn't\nask for help when I needed it.
Yeah... I'm sorry.
Yeah... I'm sure you're right.
Yeah... I've realized that, as a chef,\nI still have a long way to go.
Yeah... It's been a while since I've felt\nthis way taking photos.
Yeah... Kiuchi has been in a big slump ever since...
Yeah... Maybe that's the only way.
Yeah... Nothing good comes from hangin'\naround me.
Yeah... Now that we found the place, we have\nto check it out.
Yeah... Okay!
Yeah... Pops has always been kind of like...\na father to me.
Yeah... Sorry, I was rambling. Let's go.
Yeah... Super nervous, I could barely get my\nvoice out. I'm so rusty...
Yeah... We gotta do something about that\nfence. The power source must be somewhere\naround here.
Yeah... What happened to her?
Yeah... You don't really have a song until\nyou have both the words and music.
Yeah... You're not wrong about that.
Yeah... You're probably right. But I don't\nhave any other option.
Yeah... You're right.
Yeah... we got split up.
Yeah.|Are they true?
Yeah.|I'm not sure.|......
Yeah.|Nicely spotted.
Yeah.|Nope.|You shall call me Wonder here.
Yeah.|Thank the tourism tax.
Yeah?
Yeah? Great! Let's go!
Yeah? You think so too, don't you, Sensei?
Years ago, a female student entered this room\nto shut off the lights.
Yeeeaaah!
Yeeeaaah! We did it! We woooon!
Yeeeah!
Yeeeah! I'm all fired up!
Yelling!?
Yellow and green boxes, huh.
Yep!
Yep, another perfect day for training. Let's\ngive it our all!
Yep, even though it's still a work in\nprogress, I'm confident in it.
Yep, looks like I can leave all the\ncurry-making to you. You've come\na long way, haven't you?
Yep, that's a printer.
Yep, that's our Riko-senpai.
Yep, that's right! There's no Nobel Prize\nin math for whatever reason!
Yep, totally fine! Make sure I look\ncute, okay?
Yep, totally good! If anything, this makes\nfor some good rehab.
Yep, yep. That's what it looks like. The\nshop's spicy tsukemen.
Yep. Con caf\xe9s are way more expensive than\nmost places, right?
Yep. Just like we thought, the dam... well,\nthe Palace is in a pretty bad condition.
Yes I saw it! The Subway Slammer's that Menace everyone's talking about on the Divine Justice website.
Yes indeed. It was the Assassin's Juice.
Yes sir!
Yes!
Yes! Again!
Yes! Finally! Someone who understands what\nI'm talking about! Aren't Motoha and Shun\nutterly exasperating!?
Yes! I found it!
Yes! I knew you would understand,\n{NAME1}-san.
Yes! I love throwing and hitting!
Yes! I mean like a pen or a pencil,\nanything really...
Yes! I remember all of the days we've spent\ntogether, and they were all work!
Yes! I went and bought ten of them...
Yes! I'd like to continue talking with you\nand cultivating the fields together!
Yes! I'm trying to get them to turn over a\nnew leaf!
Yes! Just like that! Oh, and you can order\nwhatever you want, {NAME2}.
Yes! Of course we will!
Yes! Okay, every enemy is downed. Now it's\ntime for an <color=#FF423F>All-Out Attack</color>!
Yes! Please do!
Yes! Real farm work takes grit!
Yes! Right away!
Yes! Thank you so much for the tickets.
Yes! That guy's such a creep! I really hope I never run into him.
Yes! That's it! Shake it for me! Shower me with praise!
Yes! That's more like it!
Yes! That's the spirit.
Yes! That's what I like to hear!
Yes! The machine I wanted to play seems to be\navailable!
Yes! The mean would be easily affected by\nthe extreme outliers...
Yes! Um, you weren't waiting too long,\nwere you...?
Yes! Um...!
Yes! We made it to Shibuya just like\nLufel said!
Yes! Where's your "authentic flavor" now?\nOut with the bathwater, 'cause you spoiled\nthe pot for everyone!
Yes, Closer is still inexperienced in battle.\nAllow me to handle things here!
Yes, Esperanto. You're quite the diligent\nstudent. Around a million people speak it,\napparently.
Yes, Food Fight! It's a video series on my channel. You haven't heard of it?
Yes, I agree.
Yes, I knew you'd pick up what I'm putting\ndown! Unbelievably, it's over 20,000.\n23,500 haikus to be precise!
Yes, I know Shichi-kun. I keep one at the\noffice\u2014ahem. Allow me to rephrase.
Yes, I know it's none of my business. And I\nknow it won't be easy.
Yes, I love pudding!
Yes, I see that.
Yes, I think another ambush is in order.\nYou have my full confidence, Wonder.
Yes, I think that sort of question should\ninspire some good responses.
Yes, I will. Do you two work here often?
Yes, I'll be more careful.
Yes, I'll gladly accept. How can I turn down\nsuch a kind offer? 
Yes, I'm going to some sort of "dessert\nbuffet" with my grandchildren.
Yes, I've seen everything.
Yes, I've seen it! Today, you...\nYou have very good luck!
Yes, Mother's way of speaking may seem\nharsh...
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Sensei!
Yes, a large twice-cooked pork bowl.
Yes, and I sense a being with strong desires\nup ahead.
Yes, and it was even stronger than before...\nlike the power of its desire had grown.
Yes, but infiltrating the Palace will\ncertainly be risky. We ought to\nprepare thoroughly.
Yes, correct. We are talking about\nassassination here. I'm on my guard as well.
Yes, exactly! Like how baseball uniforms\nhave logos that unify the team!
Yes, exactly. I don't believe I could've made\nan entry like this any other way.
Yes, got it!
Yes, he's right. Are you really happy being\ntreated this way, Fujikawa-san?
Yes, hello?
Yes, indeed. Queen in particular. She's not\nused to the Metaverse yet.
Yes, indeed... I am more than prepared.\n{NAME1}-san...
Yes, it drives joy away and so on. Though if\nthat were true, I'd love to capture it\non film.
Yes, it is odd. I can't imagine the real\nMs. Katayama depending on Mr. Akashi in\nany way.
Yes, it truly does feel like we'll find\nsomething here.
Yes, it's astronomy. Thanks for answering\ncorrectly.
Yes, it's fine.
Yes, it's me... your homeroom teacher...
Yes, it's true.
Yes, it's wonderful to work with you,\nWonder. Well then, shall we be off?
Yes, just as I thought. Let's take a look\ninside of here.
Yes, let's start searching the first floor.
Yes, looks like I've still got it! Ah... \nnothin' beats a sweet servin' of Marthym's\nstellar customer service!
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, milk! I've heard there is nothing like\na cold bottle of milk after a hot bath.
Yes, my outfit is different. But I also feel\nboundless energy brimming within me.
Yes, of course I did.\nHowever...
Yes, of course, I'll be looking for someone to fill his place as well. Okay, bye bye.
Yes, of course. I always have time\nfor students' requests.
Yes, of course. Only if the plan goes well, right... I would be so thankful for your consideration...!
Yes, of course... Thank you for your time! All right, thank you, bye bye now.
Yes, one moment, please! Um, do you think you\ncould help some more, {NAME1}-kun?
Yes, please do.
Yes, please leave that to me.
Yes, please! Of course I do!
Yes, please! Thank you so much.
Yes, please! You've really got to see the stuff they have in stock there.
Yes, please. And yes... That must have been\npretty tough on you, huh?
Yes, please.|I'll pass.|Okay, just a little.
Yes, precisely.
Yes, sir! Let's see... That'll be 4,400 yen.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. And I'm sure yesterday's social\nmedia announcement has got all your fans on\nthe edges of their seats.
Yes, staying here will get us nowhere. We\nought to begin by finding her.
Yes, thank you!
Yes, that must be it! I knew Ms. Katayama\ncouldn't be a Palace ruler!
Yes, that one! Rumor has it that...
Yes, that will do nicely!
Yes, that's a good plan. Now, let's revise\nthe details...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, that's exactly it! Guess I'm not\nthe only Cavendish connoisseur.
Yes, that's exactly it. The sea's always been\na major obstacle when connecting the world.
Yes, that's exactly right.
Yes, that's it!
Yes, that's right.
Yes, that's right. You'll be reviewing\n<color=#FF423F>Heritage Kitchen</color> in Zoshigaya.
Yes, that's the idea!
Yes, that's the one! "Through the Cosmos!" The\nhero gallops through space on a horse!
Yes, that's the spirit. We have the utmost\nfaith in you, leader.
Yes, that's what they asked for.
Yes, the Palace is collapsing. We have to\ntake the Treasure and get out of here!
Yes, the Takemi Medical Clinic, was it? It seems we can get our hands on strong prescriptions there.
Yes, the power granted to you... That of\nthe Metaverse Navigator.
Yes, there is lots to do outside the Palace,\nsuch as readying equipment and honing\nour skills.
Yes, there's a mental disorder known as\nDiogenes syndrome that has symptoms of\ngarbage-hoarding and self-neglect.
Yes, they are a form of expression. An\nintegration of various art forms born of\nhuman desire...
Yes, this flower's fragrance and bright\nyellow hue are perfect.
Yes, this is {NAME2}-chan. He comes to talk\nwith me sometimes since we're neighbors.
Yes, this means we stopped the Shadow from\nrampaging! Now we just have to steal\nthe Treasure!
Yes, this should be able to stop that scythe.
Yes, war. Hobbes called it "the war of all\nagainst all."
Yes, we can finally enter the security room\nat long last.
Yes, we filmed it, but there was a mistake\nwe just couldn't edit around...
Yes, we should hurry...
Yes, we've got it.\nAll thanks to you three.
Yes, well done. The answer is apple.
Yes, well, I suggest we return to reality.\nI'm sure we're all exhausted from the battle.
Yes, well... I suppose we can talk about this\nnow that I have finished reviewing your\nentry.
Yes, yes, I knew you'd agree!
Yes, yes, I'm here!
Yes, you are! I never said I wanted anything else, even at career guidance at school!
Yes, you can find it in the aisle over\u2014
Yes, you'd be inclined to think that.\nI understand exactly where you're\ncoming from.
Yes, you're absolutely right. I'll try much\nharder from now on!
Yes, you're doing a stellar job.
Yes. A rather detestable memory... but it\nseems we may have been lured to another\nforgery.
Yes. Actually, I'm making an effort to try\nmany things, not just tea and the usual\nstuff they sell here.
Yes. And if we keep battling like this, it's\npossible it'll just keep recovering!
Yes. As club vice president I have to lend\na hand!
Yes. But I think I can finish the rest\nonce we arrive.
Yes. He confronted her after having arranged\nfor the academic coordinator and those two\ngirls to witness everything.
Yes. He told the academic coordinator\nas much... but it turns out that was a lie.
Yes. Her prediction that "trying to sate our hunger would lead to disaster..."
Yes. I am referring, of course, to your choices.
Yes. I can sense it. Miyazawa's Treasure\nis here.
Yes. I may resemble an owl of sorts.\nWhat of it?
Yes. I myself am able to fly. Only my outward\nappearance bears similarity to an owl.
Yes. I think Mr. Akashi was recording\nfrom the second he entered the room.
Yes. I wanted to pass it down to Shun, so I\nput it in the safe at Victory Kitchen.
Yes. I was uncertain at first because of\nAkashi's weak aura, but...
Yes. I'm a consultant. I know exactly what\nkinds of videos will boost your numbers.
Yes. If it means being able to focus more of\nour attention on the students...
Yes. It seems the energy in his armor has\nrestorative properties.
Yes. It shouldn't be far from here. Let's go.
Yes. It's about our next target. Or rather,\nit will be once we've found them...
Yes. It's easier to find Palace rulers\nthrough the collective unconscious if I know\ntheir full names.
Yes. It's me, Lufel.
Yes. It's probably an unfamiliar term,\nso allow me to give a brief explanation.
Yes. It's proof that your feelings\nreached her.
Yes. Just like with Kiuchi and Miyazawa,\nthis Palace exists outside of Mementos.
Yes. Let's go in, Wonder.
Yes. Moreover, Akashi's password was the key\nto that door in the Palace.
Yes. My father has encouraged me to help\nthe teachers with whatever they need.
Yes. Nicely remembered.
Yes. Now just as I predicted, the lingering\ncognition of Kiuchi's Palace lies ahead.
Yes. Only the memories of his crimes remain.\nHe'll likely confess to everything, including\nhis misdeeds as the Subway Slammer.
Yes. Our main product is umeboshi, but we\nalso have a restaurant that specializes in\nplum dishes.
Yes. Please address me by that name when you\nare in need of my assistance.
Yes. Solving the mysteries threatening this\nschool sometimes requires swift judgments\nlike this.
Yes. That dream became distorted in his mind,\nand his Shadow went out of control. That led\nhim to act out in the real world.
Yes. That is the spirit.
Yes. That link could aid us in locating the Palace. Let's head back to the real world for now.
Yes. The "con caf\xe9," for short. Well\nremembered.
Yes. The Shadow returned to the real\nMiyazawa's heart.
Yes. There is talent within you!
Yes. They are manifestations I constructed\nfrom cognitions buried deep inside\nyour heart.
Yes. Things could've been much worse if not\nfor Wonder and Wind's quick thinking.
Yes. This is where we were shown the videos of Kiuchi's past.
Yes. This time...
Yes. Those are the words I was waiting for.
Yes. Together, we are invincible.
Yes. We need an advisor. Someone to act as\na sort of brain, managing the functions of\nthe Phantom Thieves...
Yes. We welcome you here as our guest.
Yes. We were together before coming here,\nbut we are uncertain of her current\nwhereabouts.
Yes. We'll limit discussion of work-related\nand other important matters to this location.
Yes. Well, part-time, anyway.
Yes. When I touched Kiuchi's Treasure, my memories came back to me. At least fragments of them did.
Yes...
Yes... An imitation of a Palace belonging\nto a man known as Kamoshida.
Yes... As your only child, it is my duty to\ninherit Umetane...
Yes... Come to me.
Yes... I agree today's mission left much to\nbe desired.
Yes... I can't say I know the feeling. That's\nwhy I wanted you to hear this, Kotone-san.
Yes... I sense a malicious presence as well!\nHow could it detect that earlier than I!?
Yes... Once that guy sets his sights on a\nshop, he churns out review after review,\npanning the place down.
Yes... Taking Chiyome's abilities into\naccount, I believe I could serve best in a\nsupport role.
Yes... They are.
Yes... You splashing water on me had nothing\nto do with it. Victory Kitchen's authentic\nflavor made me feel all the more phony...
Yes... You're right. I know it's frustrating,\nbut let's retreat for now.
Yes.|No.|It depends.
Yes.|No.|Pass.
Yes?
Yessir!
Yessiree! Today you're talking to a couple of\nflorists! What can we do for you?
Yesss! That's right, you're no match for us!
Yesss, thanks!
Yesterday I had some... words with my coach.\nOkay, a fight, actually.
Yesterday a customer came in and bought up\na hundred of them, and apparently ten of\nthem won.
Yesterday, I actually spoke to Riko-senpai!\nI said hello, and she said hello back...
Yesterday, I finally managed to complete\na painting I've been working on\nfor quite a while.
Yet another mechanism... There may be a hint\nsomewhere on the floor.
Yet here you are taking your mother's word\nas gospel.
Yet safe at the same time...
Yet the legal concept of "good faith" means\nto uphold a standard of honesty and integrity\nwhen dealing with others.
Yet what is certain is that you are all\nlinked by the possession of strong desires.
Yikes, I got chewed out at the staff meeting.\nI'm a sad specimen of a science scholar.
Yikes, there's no shortage of\nnoodles or toppings...
Yikes.
Yikes... That's pretty big! When would you\nneed it by?
Yo! Let's do this thing, stupid brats!
Yo! Ready for a workout?
Yo, I heard about you from Ren!
Yo, I'm <color=#72C5FF>Incubus</color>!
Yo, Wonder! What's bonkin'!
Yo, Wonder! You showed up too, huh?
Yo, {NAME1}-san! So I was thinking we'd\ninvite Fujikawa-san to hang out today.
Yo, {NAME2}! Sorry, we started eating the\ncurry without ya!
YoOoOoU... totally get it, don't you?
Yongen-Jaya seems like a\nnice place to live...
You "saw" something again, didn't you?
You a yakitori fan, {NAME2}?
You actually came. It must have surprised you\nto hear the news from Kayo-san.
You actually chose that one... Hm. Well,\nthat's probably okay, I guess.
You again? What do you want?
You ain't getting past me!
You all look like you're running on empty...
You already keep it very neat...
You always gave me everything I had\nabandoned. All of the support and care...
You always had talent. And you seem happier\nnow. I mean, you're practically glowing!
You and Kurosawa aren't going to get a single shot in. That's all I came to say.
You and Tomoko-chan really helped us out\nthe other day.
You and your idiot friend... You women know nothing about dreams!
You appear eager to fulfill our contract.
You appear preoccupied.
You appear to have enough <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>\nnow. Attack with the <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>!
You are a lying coward...
You are aware of the many threats haunting\nthis school's hallowed halls, aren't you?
You are capable of reawakening not just your own, but others' forgotten desires.
You are chair of the disciplinary committee,\ndaughter of a CEO, have excellent grades,\nand are very popular among your peers.
You are completely worthless!
You are currently resting in your home.
You are familiar with the concept of "choice," are you not?
You are joking, right!?
You are not a candidate for advisor either.
You are not a wreck.|Don't overdo it.
You are not the only possessors of\nthis power.
You are the only one who can take action against them.
You are the woman I've been searching for all this time!
You are, right?
You at least know what a text message is,\nright...?
You ate a lot of stuff there though, Motoha!
You bastard!
You bastard! What did you do to him!?
You bastard! You threw out the soul of\nVictory Kitchen, and now\u2014!
You belong to a different group of\nPhantom Thieves? I won't ask for details,\nbut I do have one request...
You bet! I've only seen her in videos, but\nplenty of people I know are fans too.
You bet.|Not really.
You betcha.|Sorry, I can't today.
You better be. Until then, we'll train and get even stronger.
You better watch your mouth, punk!
You both don't look like military buffs to me.
You buy it, you look after it.
You call these reforms!? Why are you leaving\nstudents to fend for themselves!?
You came back! And right when we're\nshort-staffed. Perfect timing!
You came back! Glad to have you.
You came for this, didn't you?
You came to buy lunch, didn't you? Hurry up\nbefore they run out.
You came!
You can all still make it in time for sixth\nperiod. Hurry over to class now, all right?
You can also use rooibos tea instead of\nblack tea as another variation.
You can always count on me.|Let's keep doing our best.
You can apprentice under me!
You can bet on it! For sure...\nI think? Maybe?
You can borrow my book about the origin of\nthe language of flowers if you want.
You can come and check things out when it's\nconvenient for you!
You can continue exploring Mementos as it is. I'll leave it up to you whether to withdraw or not.
You can count on it.|Sure thing.|Let's lift 200 lbs together.
You can count on me.|I'm not so sure...
You can count on me.|It's like I'm talking to a wall...
You can do it!|I'm a little worried...|Knock those cr\xeapes out of the park!
You can do it, Minami.
You can do this, Ayaka...\nToday's the day for sure...
You can dodge a ball, but you can't dodge\na quiz from me. Let's go with... you,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
You can drop "senpai." I'd like everyone to\nspeak to me casually going forward.
You can even change the way you look!\nWanna give it a try now?
You can even just take one if you want.\nPlease!
You can even rent a snowmobile if you want!
You can find just about anything in\nShinjuku's bookstore. I always find myself\ngoing there.
You can find quirky shops with cheap items\nall over.
You can find some pretty rare seeds here.
You can find them in the capsule machines\nright here in Shibuya, so be on the lookout!
You can get a stamp sheet from the guy\nsitting over there.
You can get a\npanoramic view of Tokyo\nfrom this viewing platform...
You can get it back, right?
You can grill it too, but it's tough to\ncontrol the precise amount of heat, so you\nhave to be careful!
You can hear my voice then!
You can imagine how shocked I was the next\nmorning to find my wallet empty!
You can just blurt out all the things you're\ntoo uncertain or afraid to talk about.
You can just call me Motoha! The full name's a bit too formal. And {NAME1}-kun, I'll call you by your first name from now on.
You can just stand and watch. My business is with this one.
You can just tell that the mighty Taira clan\nis going to fall!
You can make a regular heptagon with origami!
You can obtain new power...
You can post images, videos, and text.\nThough, as you can see for yourself... 
You can put 'em on display, carry 'em around,\nanything you want! Woof-woof!
You can read the books over there\nif you want. Feel free to take it easy\nwhile you're here.
You can roast them, mash them, and even throw\nthem in a stew! Growing them is fun, too!
You can run, can't you?
You can take care of the shopping, Leader!\nWe'll wait right here for you!
You can take the Hanzomon Line straight there from Shibuya. The Hanzomon Line's right down those stairs there.
You can win.|As long as you train...|You're an ace all-rounder.
You can't even peel it without burning\nyourself. That's why it's a task no one\nwants to touch.
You can't get things like big, booming sound\nwhen you're watching at home!
You can't go to parent's homes, Ms. Katayama.\nIt's against regulations.
You can't hide it from me. Heheheh...
You can't lose now... Think of the prize!\nGood luck, {NAME2}!
You can't see his face at all, but his fans\nwould recognize him from any angle.
You can't stand it when people say "all\nyouths act the same," right?
You can't stay too late, though. Follow those\nrules and you can come as often as you'd\nlike!
You can.
You can. I'm sorry for making you worry too.
You catch on quick. We can use skills on our\nallies to transfer the fake money.
You catch on quick. We can use skills on\nour allies to transfer the cash.
You certainly appear to have gotten the hang of battle. Keep it up now.
You certainly seem to be feeling its\nmedicinal benefits, though...
You cheeky little brats...! I'll chop you all\nto bits!
You consider me a friend?|What's gotten into you?
You continue to reject your own free will.
You could come to mine.|How about your place?
You could make both.|Let the kids choose.
You could win this.|You don't want to go?|It sounds cool.
You could've said that before we came in here...
You dare blame me for the stress of my employees?
You dare call me a liar? You're the one\nwhose lies and bullshit ruined\nVictory Kitchen!
You dare slander my art!? You ungrateful wretch!
You deserve...a better teacher...
You did actually see it go down, right?\nDid Katayama really attack him?
You did amazing last time, so today I'd like\nyou to pick out flowers.
You did good work today.|Don't sweat it.
You did great today, Motoha.|What you said back there was cool.
You did it, {NAME1}! You're the best!
You did not complete the Kagura Dance as I\nasked. Please leave.
You did some great work today.\nCome back anytime.
You did something, didn't you? About\nall this.
You did your best.|That was so cool.|No regrets?
You didn't do anything to hurt us, Kano-kun!\nWe chose to help you by our own free will,\nbecause that's what we wanted to do!
You didn't do anything wrong.|Is that all you want to say to her?|What do you want to do?
You didn't eat too quickly or let the noodles\nsit too long. Each move was well calculated.
You didn't even realize you finished eatin'?\nWhat better compliment is there than that?
You didn't know?|Is it really that famous?
You didn't leave it at home?
You do have high standards.|That's a tough one.
You do know we're in the middle of talking\nabout Katayama-san now, right?
You do? Oh, uh... Okay.
You do?|But how?
You don't even know, do you?
You don't have cram school until later,\nright? I came up with a new puzzle!
You don't have enough money.
You don't have to give up!|You have to follow your heart!
You don't have to look very far to find it.\nBut I am a sleuth with a search engine.
You don't have to say anything, I already\nknow. I understand! And I know how painful\nit is...
You don't have to tell me, I already know.
You don't have to worry about that. Regular\npeople can't hear my voice.
You don't have to. I don't want you to see me like this.
You don't know the first thing about\u2014
You don't know what you're talking about, so shut it! No one wants to hear from the outfield!
You don't look fine! I'd feel bad making you\nwalk away like that.
You don't look like one to me.|Stubborn yet stunning.
You don't look well.|Are you sure you're okay?
You don't mind if I send this to your school, right?
You don't mind, right?
You don't mind? Truth is, things have been\nkinda tight for me this month.
You don't need to hide it, I can see right\nthrough such feigned ignorance.
You don't need to know. Now then, I have an announcement video to make!
You don't need to thank me.|I haven't done a thing.
You don't remember it either, Cattle?
You don't remember me? <color=#FF423F>Kayo Tomiyama</color>?\nOur families would get together and have\ndinner every now and then.
You don't say! This whole place reminds me of\nthe huge shopping malls in Chengdu.
You don't seem to be unconsciously trying\nto act like some authority, either.
You don't sound so sure. And you should know crying, "Slump!" as an excuse isn't gonna cut it.
You don't wanna mess with a hot-head\nteacher like that. What a Menace.
You don't want to compose music?|I want to play a song you wrote.
You don't want to stand out too much,\nof course, but you should take care in your\nappearance nonetheless.
You don't? Really? How do you survive the\nafternoon classes?
You drove off the bridge to save me... I owe you my life, brother!
You earned a special prize for your\nachievement.
You even fell on your backside. Talk about putting on a show!
You even had their part-timers running scared before you even finished.
You even knew that I had trained at Victory\nKitchen and was tryin' to develop my palate\nwith {NAME2}...
You even practice at home, which means\nyou must be motivated!
You exploited their dreams.|Was that really your goal?
You failed before, but in his endless\ngenerosity, Kiuchi-sama will grant you\nanother chance.
You failed to complete the Kagura Dance\nin time. Please leave.
You figured me out!|Just look inside real fast.
You filthy fly on dirty money...
You finally said it, eh?
You forget about your whys and why nots\nand just enjoy yourself now!
You gave me all that advice, and I might as\nwell have flushed it down the drain!
You get a stamp for each question you get\nright! And there's a prize for getting\nthem all!
You get bloated.|You'd fell unwell.|You would die.
You get hit with this cool description that\ntells you what kind of story you're in for.\nThe same goes for the opening.
You get it now? Then hurry up and\ngive me a hand!
You get what you deserve! For I am this country's one and only idol!
You get why they're worried, right?
You getting back into baseball is better than\nanything I could've wished for!
You go ahead and wait for me at the\nstation square. Oh, hold on, I'll walk you\ndownstairs!
You go overtime more than anyone else!
You goddamn pest. It was all your fault!
You got captured!?
You got dirt in your ears or something? I told you already. Nobody cares about strangers anymore, idiot!
You got it!
You got it! Let's get back to the real world,\nWonder!
You got it! Stewed egg and roast pork for\nthe pet owl comin' right up!
You got it!|I heart Shibuya!
You got it.|Why?
You got me... I've been playing this super\naddictive new action game!
You got me.|Dunno what you mean...
You got that?
You got us.|You're mistaken.|We went out for burgers.
You gotta come down to walk it eventually.\nThat was the case for me as well.
You gotta give this your all...
You gotta reel fans in! You'll never rise to\nstardom just waiting around!
You gotta try harder than that! Why do they\neven have weights that light!?
You guessed it! It's delicious and has\ntons of tomatoes in it!
You guessed it. It's ramen that can be\nadjusted to suit the state of the person\neatin' it.
You guessed it. Regular hexagons. It lets\nbees make hives while saving on labor and\nmaterials.
You guys are headed to the clinic in Yongen, right?
You guys are just disposable extras to make\nthe real star shine!
You guys are so weird... Obviously the best\nway to know if a restaurant is good is to try\nthe food yourself.
You guys aren't the only ones at fault.\nI used to be kinda scared of her, and it\nprobably showed...
You guys have helped us out so much, today's\nmeal is our treat!
You guys too, huh. Come to think of it,\nwhere's Closer? Is she missing?
You guys wanted to get above ground, right?\nThere's still one working elevator.
You guys! Don't be so rude! {NAME1}'s doing us a favor here!
You guys...
You guys...! Thank you!
You had to calculate every bill, so your\nmental math must be in tip-top shape!
You handled it skillfully.
You handled the customers well. I expected\nno less from you.
You handled today's event like a champ and\nreally came through for me.
You happened to catch my boss's eye,\nso he told me to make you sign a contract.
You have 2 turns left. Please complete\nthe dance.
You have a friend now.|You started hanging with me.
You have a job to do, right? Don't worry about me.
You have a lot going on inside. It's not\nlike you're putting on a fake mask.
You have a nice place here.
You have a special power, don't you? It's\nhard to put into words, but...
You have already proven this to be true.
You have been summoned.
You have chosen. Now make it so.
You have completed the Kagura Dance...\nI shall reward you.
You have demonstrated incredible potential\nthrough your innate, indelible fervor\nfor life.
You have experience with plants?|That's all we have to do?
You have girls in your Phantom Thief\ngroup too, right, {NAME2}?
You have gone far beyond my expectations.\nSurely, you must feel it too.
You have good taste... Mmmm... Good choice.
You have hurt a lot of innocent people. Stolen their hope away from them...
You have more than two years before you\ngraduate. I'm sure you'll make up by then!
You have my gratitude. Now then...
You have my sincerest gratitude. Now then...
You have my thanks, Yaoling-san. When it\ncomes to tea service, your acumen is\nunquestionable.
You have my utmost thanks. Also...
You have no idea!
You have no right to call yourself a fan of\nNaruru. I ask that you leave.
You have no right to run from this!
You have only one turn left. Please hurry\nand complete the dance.
You have passed the test and may now take on\nthe honor of <color=#FF423F>guarding Kiuchi-sama's\nvaluables</color>.
You have quite the nerve, invading the very\nplace I stand guard!
You have returned Home.
You have roused me from my deep slumber\nwithin you.
You have shown me new potential.
You have things you want to do. A purpose of\nyour own.
You have to figure out which\ntwo out of seven suspects\nare lying.
You have to find the treasure by exploring\nShibuya and solving riddles!
You have to go to other places, where your\nsense of common knowledge and way of thinking\ndoesn't totally translate.
You have to promise me you won't do anything\ndangerous, though. Okay?
You have to strive for that or you'll never\nmove forward. That's what Yukimi-san\ntaught me.
You have your own driver?|You sure are rich...
You haven't been coming to press me for an answer recently.
You haven't done anything wrong, Shun. In fact, I like that side of you.
You haven't done anything wrong.|He's to blame, not you.
You haven't heard of <color=#FF423F>Magatsukami's</color>\n<color=#FF423F>Divine Justice</color>?
You haven't heard of Magatsukami's Divine Justice?
You haven't heard of him? Gourmet Food Critic Hiromu Miyazawa? He's on TV all the time.
You haven't heard? Recently, everyone asks\nfor Riko-senpai when there's a dispute.
You haven't shut up about him since the last time we went.
You haven't truly manifested your desire for yourself.
You headed out somewhere? Or are you on your way home?
You heading home any time soon?|How long do you plan on staying?
You heard from Kayo-san that my audition\ndidn't go well, right?
You heard what I said in the video, didn't\nyou? I am the legal owner of this shop.
You helped keep things running smoothly.Thanks!
You helped me so much today... Sorry for\nbeing such a burden.
You idiot!
You incurred my wrath, and now you are bound\nto tear down everyone around you. Isn't that\nhow it always goes?
You indulge in scamming others with horrendous\nmethods that target minors exclusively.
You just add iced tea to some peach syrup and\nstir! Yup! It's that easy!
You just don't carry that stuff with you,\nso I didn't expect it.
You just give it a little stir once it's all\nin the glass. It should be easy for you to\nmake at home too.
You just keep harping on the same old tune, don't you? Enough dancing, Yamagoshi-san. Time to sing a new song.
You just riffled through my insides looking\nfor that password! I'm livid!
You just seem special somehow.
You just sit back and watch?|How do you know what's right?
You just wanna flirt with that barista there, don't you?
You just want to go.|Fine, I'll tag along.
You just want to go.|I am a little curious.
You keep things in good order as it is.\nA little more cleaning should hardly prove difficult.
You kidding me? I'm gonna miss my meeting.
You kidding me? Man, what a pain.
You kids gonna run around with my goods and make trouble for me?
You kids have no idea how tough it gets out\nin the real world. Money doesn't come easy!
You kids look like it's your naptime again.\nLook alive, {PLAYER_NAME}!
You kids really are optimistic...
You kids would be nothing but savages!
You know I'm only using 50% of my power,\nright? This ain't even a warm-up for me!
You know Miyazawa, the food critic? He's on\na bunch of food shows, and he streams too.
You know Mr. Endo, the English teacher?\nHe always seems kinda bored.
You know Shichi-kun!? Are you a fan?\nI love Shichi-kun!
You know any good memorizing tricks?\nLike that "PEMDAS" thing or somethin'?
You know anything about this type of thing?\nMaybe you could give it a look...
You know her!?
You know how much influence he has. The second we say somethin', he'll just spin some more lies and fool everyone.
You know how some places are quite busy,\nyet surprisingly cozy and welcoming?
You know how the infielders gather on the\npitcher's mound when they need to strategize?
You know how they say that arguing with\nsomeone is proof that you're close?
You know how to fight, right? I'll follow your lead! Show me how to take them down!
You know how to play?|Sounds cool!|I'd love to watch you.
You know how young people are.|You shouldn't be too nosy.|Aren't you worrying too much?
You know it?
You know so much about these things, Minami-chan. Thank you!
You know that caf\xe9 on the corner is always\nfull of girls?
You know that rumor, Sensei? Or better yet,\nhave you ever met her?
You know the deadly flower blooming in\nyour heart? That's me!
You know the drill. We'll search the area\nand keep our eyes peeled for any hints.
You know them?|Don't run off too far.
You know we can't go through the front\nentrance. We need a different way in.
You know what that is? Then I trust you.\nLet's wipe out those enemies.
You know what they say about us old ladies, always meddling in people's business.
You know what your problem is?
You know what? I think I will! Nothing more pathetic than giving up before you even try!

You know, something about this feels super\nfamiliar to me...

You know, that reminds me of something...\nHow about a little warm-up question to\nget the gears turning?
You know, the Exploration Team actually used\nto be just Haruna-chan and Ito-kun.

You know, you might lose sight of what's\ntruly important if you're too by the book.
You know, you ought to address your superiors with\n"-san." I thought I already taught you that.
You know, you're a pretty mysterious guy.
You know...
You learned about averages in middle school,\nright? They'll often pop up in online survey\nresults.
You left it out to rust!? Pops and Masa-san\ntreasured that thing with their lives!
You left the "future plans" part blank...
You let me know if you want my help with anything!
You like sweet stuff, huh, Shun?
You like the idea, but it just doesn't quite\nhit the spot, huh?
You like the taste, but it just doesn't quite\nhit the spot, huh?
You likely haven't noticed yourself, but there are people you've influenced through your interactions.
You little brat! Don't you dare defy Kiuchi-sama!
You little...
You live in Tokyo, don't you? I doubt this\nwould even cover the cost of the land.
You look absolutely adorable, Riko-senpai!\nIs this for TV!?
You look as though you want to say something. No matter, I won't press you on it.
You look dashing with flowers in hand.
You look different...|Why are you an owl!?
You look positively beat. Why not head home\nafter a brief respite?
You look quite pleased with yourself today.
You look rather inspired.
You looked like you wanted to say something.
You looked rather at peace surrounded by all\nthose flowers. Now then, let's go home.
You looked remarkably at ease among the\nflowers. Now, let's make our way home.
You losing your desire to know is just one example.
You lost fair and square, kid. Your ramen\nwas revolting!
You made it across. Excellent poise\nas always.
You made it back! Did you find the chains?
You made me wait quite a while.
You make one move against me and I'll kill her. You hear me? I'll kill her!
You may address me as <color=#72C5FF>King Frost</color>, hee-ho!
You may be free to make your own choices,\nbut perhaps you should take a page out of\nMotoha's book when it comes to food.
You may be right about that!
You may be right, Yaoling-san. Every pairing\nyou gave me was delicious.
You may be right.|What about you?|Their passions lie elsewhere.
You may be the enemy, but your attachment to your Treasure... Well, I appreciate the strength of that desire.
You may call me <color=#FF423F>Lufel</color>. I expect\nyour respect.
You may call me Fox. I follow the path of an\nartist as I endeavor to elevate my craft.
You may deliver this world from fading hope\nto salvation... Or perhaps to devastation\ninstead.
You may forge hope through interaction with other embracers of desire.
You may leave it to me. As Naruru's fan,\nI have prepared well in advance.
You may think of it as a mere push, but it\nwas a huge step forward for me!
You may utilize each of your Personas to\nmatch your ever-changing environment and\ncircumstance.
You maybe do it like this?
You mean I should pick on instinct? Hmm...
You mean designing some kind of symbol to\nstand as the mark of the Phantom Thieves?
You mean he is not compensating you idols\nfairly?
You mean hold hands?|That's too early for us.
You mean it!? Thank you so much! I really\nappreciate it!
You mean it!? Thanks, man! You're a total\ngodsend!
You mean it's sapping electricity made by\nthe dam and using it to power itself?
You mean like...!
You mean that thing that came out of me before? Calling itself Awilda...? You know what that is?
You mean the Shadows?|They were in our way.
You mean the fight is fixed!? I refuse to\ntake part in this!
You mean the statue?|The one by the station?
You mean the thing about every yakisoba bread from the school shop being handmade and having a unique flavor?
You mean thieving?
You mean to say Akashi was actively sowing\nthe seeds of discord at these companies?
You mean until you start getting misty eyed and your heart goes aflutter? Ah, sweet, sweet, Tomoko.
You mean we get to be thieves? Awesooome!
You mean what kind of people do I want to\neat it...? That's a good point.
You mean... *gasp*
You mean... Tomoko?
You mean... helping out at the cafe?
You mentioned that the other day, too,\nLufel.
You mentioned the ramen before... What'd you\nreally think of it?
You might be on the right track there...\nIt was written for a band, so it wants a\nclear rhythm...
You might be onto something. If only we could\nfind a way to steal it...
You might be onto something. If only we\ncould find a way to steal it...
You might be right, but if this keeps up I'll\nbe in real trouble!
You might be right.|Are you sure?|You've got a keen eye.
You might be right.|You really think so?
You might better understand it as "the collective unconscious," where the masses' innermost cognitions coalesce.
You might know Harajuku for the fashion, but\nthey also have great restaurants here.
You might think a bartender just has to shake\nup a mixer, but not always!
You monster!
You moron!
You must be Closer. I've heard all about you.\nI'm Fox, it's a pleasure.
You must be a great listener, {NAME1}-kun. Maybe you'd be good at a job like that?
You must be eager to fulfill our contract.
You must be exhausted from today. I suggest\nwe turn in early.
You must be exhausted, huh?
You must be exhausted. Perhaps it is time to\nhead home and rest?
You must be fatigued.
You must be getting exhausted of all this\ndesk work, Mr. Akashi. I'll finish organizing\nthe data for you.
You must be mentally drained. I believe\nthat's enough for today.
You must be quite the connoisseur to wanna\nread this first! I'm impressed.
You must be the intruders!
You must be wiped. You can lean on my\nshoulder if you need.
You must be {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nMind if I call you {NAME1}-kun?
You must get it by now. This is all\nmy fault.
You must have felt such compassion for the\nneeds of others today.
You must have practice tomorrow too, so...
You must have. If you didn't, you wouldn't\nhave come.
You must hire some super-famous designer\nconsidering your level, right?
You must like music a lot.|I wanted to hear you.|What were you gonna play?
You must've lit a fire under him!
You mustn't feel embarrassed. Once you cast\naway the momentary shame, you will feel only\nbliss.
You need a %d yen ticket to fish here. Wanna\nbuy a ticket?
You need a distraction.|What do you wanna do, Tomoko?|Can I have your number?
You need more money? Here's more!
You need something? I'm pretty busy getting\ninfo on the new Menace right now...
You need to be strong to fight in the\nMetaverse, right?
You need to stop doing this to Take-kun.\nThis is just bullying.
You need your eyes checked, kid. You didn't see Yamagoshi-san stamp the contract just now?
You needn't feel so apprehensive about\naccepting my gratitude.
You never know what will go viral.|Not bad for your first video.
You noticed? Very impressive, {NAME2}!
You okay, Sensei!?
You okay, {NAME1}? Can you make the kick?
You okay? You're not burned, are you?
You okay?|Is it mocktail time?
You okay?|You don't look so good.
You ought to be able to judge the cameras'\nfield of view, Wonder.
You ought to be the one to choose what\nwe do.
You ought to see it with your own eyes.
You oughta be careful when you're on your own. People like that are everywhere these days.
You owned this shop with your late wife, didn't you? Do you really want to watch it all crumble?
You paid Hiromu Miyazawa a visit, didn't you?
You plan on helping out with your mother's\nwork when you're done with school, right?
You probably can't hear it yourself, but I\nuse it to gather information on\nthe Metaverse.
You probably heard, but lately our Gourmet\nSpecial Strawberry Cr\xeape has been trending\non social media...
You quickly picked up the job through mere\nobservation. A remarkable feat, indeed.
You raise plants too, right?\nIt might come in handy!
You read the whole book, but I never saw\nyou actually attempt any of the poses...
You ready for a fight?
You ready to go?
You really are a good singer, Ayaka. Even\nwhile playing guitar, you don't fall out of\nrhythm at all.
You really are a lifesaver.
You really are a natural! What did we ever\ndo without you?

You really had the tenacity to overcome your\nlimits. Incredible.
You really have a keen sense of taste, Arai.
You really helped me out today in a big way.
You really helped out by coming in today.
You really like rollercoasters, don't you?\nAnd... I have also been curious to try\nit out!
You really need to pick a premise and stick with it.
You really think so? Hehehehe...!
You recognize Ayaka?|Ayaka's famous now?
You recreated the first page perfectly!
You remember that girl who spoke to me last\ntime we were here?
You remember that monjayaki joint, right?\nIt made me think about runnin' a business.
You remember the Assassin's Juice incident,\nyes? One of the mysteries threatening our\nschool?
You remember the steps Yamagoshi told you,\nright? The first thing is...
You remember {PLAYER_NAME}-san, right?\nHe's my sensei!
You remembered!
You rock! You're the best, Yumi-chan!
You ruined it yourself.|You threw your own life away.
You running sets here?|Must require a lot of stamina.
You said cheat days are important.|Depriving yourself's worse for you.
You said it! Do you know how often I have\nto take work home with me? I could\ndrop dead any minute!
You said it! Especially as one of those\ndrunks yerself, Chizuko-san! Ahahaha!
You said it's a shop, correct? What kind of shop?
You said it, we need to do something... Hm?\nThat round thing on the wall looks familiar.
You said it. I even got you wrapped up in it.
You said it. It was some money-grubbing\nmoron who put Pops and Masa-san in a\nbad spot.
You said it. We told him he's banned, but\nthat didn't do a lick of good.
You said it... \nI don't know why it's all by itself.
You said it.|This guy is unforgivable.
You said you'd be late today because of the\nstaff meeting...
You saved us today. We would've been\noverwhelmed with our usual numbers.
You saw for yourself, didn't you? Someone who\ncould not hold onto hope, and so, let go of life.
You saw something that looked like that locked door?
You saw what happened in my past, yet still don't show an ounce of remorse, do you, Motoha Arai?
You saw, didn't you?
You say it's similar... So what's different?\nIs it a teriyaki burger or something?
You say that like I'm not running out of\nsteam myself!
You say that, but we're two generations apart...
You say that, but you did seem to be\nenjoying yourself.
You say your gonna talk your way into taking over their ship...?\nYou've gotta be kiddin'! They'll never listen to ya!
You saying that lifted my spirits a little.
You scared off the moles with high-pitched\nsound waves? Where did you get that idea?
You scared?|You're hurting my arm.
You see all those bottles on the shelves?\nMy job is to make drinks with them.
You see the article?\nApparently Kiuchi's\nin a slump.
You see them all the time in our daily lives.\nFor example: disposable hand warmers!
You see, I actually offered to help with this\nevent at my little brother's kindergaren...
You see, I may have had one too many to\ndrink last night. My head's still spinning...
You see, I used to be in the dance club back\nwhen I was in college.
You see, even I have heard the phrase "when\nit comes to games, don't play more than an hour a day."
You see, the orange tabby seems to be\nsearching for something.
You see, their leaves haven't been growing\nwell lately.
You see... I posted that picture online last\nnight, and it caused a bit of an outrage.
You seek power, correct?
You seem awfully satisfied.
You seem eager to confirm something. Very\nwell, let's be on our way.
You seem mature and reliable.|You might be a bit much for some.|What's a space cadet?
You seem rather... excitable when you're around him...
You seem satisfied.
You seem stunned.
You seem to be feeling the protagonist's\nkindness too. I can see it on your face.
You seem to be in pretty good shape,\njust like she said! Sharp eyes, too!
You seem to have found a place for yourself in your world.
You seem to have made good progress. We'll\nhave to come back again sometime.
You seem to have picked it all up quite quickly. Were you even shaken when you got lost in the Metaverse?
You seem to have remembered something.
You seem to know Shibuya well, {NAME2}-kun.\nMaybe we should hang out here together more\noften?
You serious!? They got us surrounded!
You seriously know a celebrity? That's...\nThat's kind of crazy to think about.
You set me up! I never took the money! It was you!
You set your weight on one side of the arch\nto turn when you skate into a curve.
You shall forever rue the day
You should apologize to every shop you made\nsuffer, and take back all your false reviews.
You should be able to make use of these tips\nwhen you work at the beef bowl shop.
You should be more concerned about your\nchild than your reputation!
You should check him out further if you're curious...
You should come join us some time.\nYou could witness Ryuji's devastating\nstudy techniques.
You should do what feels right.|You already know.
You should do what you think is right instead\nof trying to please people and regretting it.
You should enjoy it! Such is the work of a Phantom Thief.
You should go and give it a try for sure!\nYou'll have a ball!
You should go home and head straight to bed!
You should have just gotten a <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>\ncapable of dealing with this <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>.
You should know better than anyone just how painful it is to give up your dream!
You should know by now there is always a way\nto unlock these things. Let's investigate\nthoroughly.
You should know when to stop.|Stop teasing the poor kid.
You should make sure to say hi to them next\ntime you see 'em!
You should remember both MLK and Curie...
You should rest soon. I will as well.
You should say no to the academic coordinator\ntoo. Don't just accept whatever he tells you\nto do.
You should see the tranquil look on her face\nwhen she pets the neighborhood dogs. She's\nsuch a sweet girl!
You should sit this one out.|You sure you're okay?
You should take this opportunity to relax and\nforget your troubles.
You should talk to her.|Say what's on your mind.|Go on, ask her.
You should try studying there.
You should wear one sometime. Here, I'll let\nyou try mine on.
You shoulda seen Queen. She awakened her\nPersona and was suddenly on a motorcycle.
You shouldn't dwell on other people's\nproblems as if they're your own. But if\nthings go well for them...
You shouldn't hold back among comrades,\n<NAME2>. On that note, I won't hesitate\nto help myself to some of that meat.
You shouldn't rush into anything, Kotone-san!\nYour fans will understand!
You shouldn't throw animals, dammit!
You showed up only to find a grown adult\nwaiting for you.
You simply wanted someone else to blame, so you could justify throwing away your desires.
You smug little rats...! I'll cut you all\ndown to si\u2014
You solved it though, right? So it's fine!
You somehow remind me of myself... Wait...
You sound confident! You'll have to teach me.
You sound like you couldn't care less. No way\nI'm leaving Motoha Arai's coaching to a jerk\nlike you.
You sounded good.|You did great on your own!
You stay with Closer.|I'll go save those two.
You still came to compete knowing you'd\nlose...
You still haven't decided that part, have you?
You still haven't given up on that!? We're\nnot gonna have any recollection of what\nhappened here once we leave!
You still lack the insight to find your\nopponent's weaknesses. You need practice.
You stinking rug rats don't have a clue. The\npen may be mightier than the sword, but this\nblade will write you out of existence!
You students are working so hard. As your\nteacher, I can't be so irresponsible anymore.
You stupid brats don't get it.
You summon me? Me... excited...!
You sure about that? I feel like Queen would\njust lay the beatdown on any baddies.
You sure about that?|She can't be right all the time.|Something's not right here.
You sure it wasn't too heavy? It felt like my\narms were about to fall off.
You sure know a lot books. I'm impressed!
You sure that's all?|You just wanted to hang out more.
You sure you're holding up? Seriously, eat\nsomething.
You take the other side.
You talkin' to your muscles again? Still as\ndisciplined as ever, I see.
You the newbie Tsurumi talked about? You've\nnever touched a bass in your life, right?
You there! Excuse me!
You there! Lemme make that power of your\nheart burn!
You there! Woman! To be my strength\nis the ultimate happiness!
You there! Would you be interested in buying\none of these?
You there! Would you help out with this\nexperiment? Or you could at least refer a friend!
You there! {PLAYER_NAME}!
You there, intruders!\nYou're coming with us!
You there, with the cheeky look on your face!
You there, young man... Won't you join me\nin prayer?
You think of everything...|Dependable as always.
You think so too, Sensei?
You think so too, huh?
You think so too, right, Wonder?
You think so too? Creating something takes\na lot of effort.
You think so too? I guess it's no problem for\nsome people...
You think so too? I mean, being an adult is\nnothing to be proud of on its own...
You think so?
You think so? Heh, now I want you to watch\nme play sometime.
You think so? Hehe, that's nice of you to say. Truth is, I was kind of scared to come to the station today.
You think so? Maybe I've matured a bit after\nall of this.
You think so? Thank you.
You think so? Wait, maybe you're onto\nsomething!
You think so? Well, um, thanks...
You think so?|What do you mean?
You think some cop's gonna sympathize with you? What year do you think this is?
You think that makes this the "real" soup?\nYou really are beyond help, kid.
You think this is anywhere near <color=#FF423F>50</color>?\nGet serious!
You think voguish is a hard word?
You think we can get started with the interview now?
You think we should go over there? But I\ndon't think we can get past the fence...
You think you can just walk in here and talk\nshit? You oughta watch yourself!
You think? That's kind of you to say.
You three are together a lot lately. If\nthat's just because you're friends and all,\nthat's great, but...
You three! Where have you been?\nSkipping class without permission...
You too, Closer! Good to see you're\ndoing well!
You took Kiuchi's desires and induced his change of heart not for yourselves, but for the sake of others.
You took a hit! <color=#FF423F>Heal</color> yourself!
You took a video of that, didn't you!? Heck,\nyou're still recordin'!
You took the words outta my mouth.|Of course I will.
You took the words right out of my mouth.\nDo you have any idea how much danger you\nalmost put yourselves in just now?
You treat women like they're dolls for you to lord over. But they're not. They're human beings.
You tried to throw everything away...\nYour pride, your hope, your will, even your life...
You trying to get fired, Masa!? You know\nwhat? You're all fired! The whole staff!
You two again... Was that written apology\nyou submitted nothing but lies?
You two are students, aren't you? Once you've\nentered the workforce, you won't have time\nto mess around like this.
You two done stocking the shelves? We've got\na whole other box of inventory to put out.
You two enjoy the ramen without me. My presence would likely trouble the staff.
You two invited me here today to lift my\nspirits, correct?
You two shouldn't cause Tanemura-san any\nmore trouble.
You two were awesome!
You two worked here today then, did you? What\na shame. If only I had come earlier.
You two...
You usually cook for yourself, right? What\ndo you make with it?
You wait till Katayama-san leaves the room\nto start bad-mouthing behind her back?
You waltzed into the middle of a shoot... You\ninterfered! Um... That's right, you committed\na serious obstruction of business!
You wanna go there, {NAME2}-chan? Okey\ndokey, let's go!
You wanna hit Zoshigaya tonight? I'm craving some Heritage Kitchen gyoza.
You wanna imitate a Menace?\nHahaha, that's wild! Are you a Menace too!?
You wanna look into Akashi, right?
You wanna note something down?|Like pen and paper?
You want a fight? You got one!
You want a soda? Or orange juice? I'll go get a few drinks.
You want many answers.
You want me in your club?|Do I really look that shifty?
You want me to describe it? Um...
You want me to pretend I'm boiling ramen?\nKinda like air guitar but with a strainer?
You want to break up? But why!?
You want to do research in the library?\nThere was actually something I wanted\nto look into, too...
You want to go on your own? It could be\na risk... What do you think, Wonder?
You want to go to that bank up there, right?
You want to hear more about our date? As if!\nI'll just leave it to your imagination!
You want to join Moe-chan's fan club. right?
You want to match me, a Queen Swan?\nYou'll have to practice all night, lest you wish to remain ugly ducklings!
You want to put the ball there?
You want to secure the Core first? That plan\ncould work, yes.
You wanted cooling spray, right!?
You wanted to see this one?
You wanted to talk to {NAME2}-san\nafter all. How about I leave you be for\na bit?
You went blank for a moment there. Something\nthe matter?
You went to their house for that!? Do you\nnot see how inappropriate that is!?
You were a brat back then too. A cheeky little freak running around like you didn't give a damn.
You were a huge help today! Thanks for coming\nwith me on such short notice.
You were brilliant, {NAME2}!
You were definitely meant to be a musician,\nAyaka. More than I ever was.
You were even better.|You sounded great on lead keyboard.
You were great!
You were much closer to her than I ever was.
You were my one and only rival... I could\nnever forget your name.
You were pretty forceful with me.|Hence the kindred spirit thing?|That explains things.
You were saying you've been eating a lot of\nnoodles and wanted a change of pace, right?
You were scouted? That's amazing! We should celebrate!
You were splendid today.
You were staring into space again. Is that a habit of yours?
You were staring into space again.\nIs everything all right?
You were superb, {NAME2}!
You were talking with the chef before, weren't you? Do you know him or something?
You were the one who gave me my dream.
You were there when it happened, right?
You were thinking that this whole time!? You\nshould have told me then!
You were waiting?|Why?
You were with her at the diner too. Who the\nhell are you?
You were? I spoke with him about it too.\nI know I just have to do my best.
You weren't kiddin'! This really is moist...
You weren't listening.|I wouldn't call that relaxed.
You will inherit Umetane's legacy one day.\nAnd leaders do not show weakness.
You will never truly grow if you keep\nrelying on others for help.
You will understand one day. For now, keep\nmy words at heart.
You will? Sorry for the trouble, but that'd\nbe a huge help.
You wish to place something in the locker?
You with the body immune to rot... Let us\nwelcome the impending day of salvation\ntogether as one...
You won't back out on me now... right?
You won't gain momentum by kicking your feet\nbackwards. You'll just get sand everywhere.
You would do best to keep that in mind.
You would like to grow crops and such on\nour land?
You would've needed permission from the\nlandowner to dig there in the first place, so\nperhaps it's fair.
You wouldn't be able to conduct classes\nanyway. You'd just get bombarded\nwith questions.
You wouldn't even need to choose. Just walk\nin and buy up all their stock.
You youngsters are always looking for\nshortcuts, but seemingly irrelevant info\ncan prove its worth at times.
You! The monster that exploited my teacher's\nlove for her students\u2014Kei Akashi! I will\ntake back everything you've stolen!
You!? You recorded that!?
You'd be surprised by how much dust gathers.
You'd be willing to help carry some of this\nfor me?
You'd better discard that idea. Friendship\nonly robs us of our freedom.
You'd better enjoy these days while\nthey last!
You'd better not try to steal her next time\nwe meet either!
You'd better watch your backs for the one in the black mask.
You'd have better luck with her than with me.
You'd let your only memory of her slip through your fingers over something as trifling as "authentic flavor"?
You'd never guess by the way\nit looks, but the drink tastes\nmild yet complex...
You'd never know if someone didn't tell\nyou, right? That's the charm of the stuntman\nbehind the mask!
You'd probably get all spooked after the\nmovie, being home all by yourself, {NAME2}.
You'd rather not?
You'd run around exploring, and sit around\nthe house together playing with your puzzles\nand riddle books.
You'd think so, but...
You'd think so, right? I mean, it is English,\nafter all. But that's incorrect. It's France.
You'd think the police would handle this kind\nof thing, but they actually don't!
You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave\nyou to it.
You'll be asked to hang up your uniform for this.
You'll be left unemployed and publicly hated, but...
You'll be the first to get to taste the best\nones, so get your taste buds ready for a trip\nto Flavor Town.

You'll never have love. After all, every\nsingle person in your life...
You'll see!
You'll teach me? I'll bring the workbook,\nso just wait a moment!
You'll tell me all about it, right? Right?\nRight!?
You'll want to heat up the spices in the pot\nfirst, 'til you can smell 'em. Then add the\nmeat, potatoes, and carrots in order.

You're a perceptive one, {NAME2}-kun!
You're a pro, Shiina-chan! It was like\nwatching a show. It's not just me, right?
You're a regular? Then did you know about the\nside menu here?
You're a spy who came here on your master's orders, aren't you!?\nYour love of savory tofu pudding is a total lie!
You're a terrible liar, Kano-kun. Hehe.\nYour face says it all.
You're a vital part of our team, after all.
You're a weird kid, huh?
You're a wonderful teacher who protects all\nof her students, including me!
You're absolutely right...
You're aiming for a school with super high\nstandards, right, Shota-kun? That's great!
You're all far too quick to trust Tanemura.\nWhat if she's secretly on Akashi's side!?
You're already a model employee.
You're already an expert at this.
You're amazing for doing this.|Volunteering? On top of work?
You're amazing, Yumi-chan!
You're an absolute lifesaver. Now we can play in games again.
You're an old hand at this by now.
You're awful at whistling.
You're both such hard workers. I'll be\ncounting on you again today.
You're bound to bump into someone if you're\nplaying with your phones while walking\ndown the hall!
You're certainly brimming with energy and\nstamina today.
You're certainly more versed in flora\ncompared to the first day.
You're clearly crestfallen, but worry not.
You're correct. It means "one" as in\n"single."
You're cute today, Yaoling.|That looks really good on you.
You're different from this riff raff.
You're doing it the wrong way.|You're hurting people.
You're finally talking to me like normal!
You're free to enjoy the aroma, but I also\nrequire your attention... Are you listening?
You're free to go now. See you next time!
You're giving me too much credit.
You're going down in style!
You're going so far away, when I just want\nto stay friends like this forever...
You're going to be late too. Head to class.
You're going to embarrass me
You're going to pay for every single person you've hurt through your crimes.
You're going to regret underestimating me!
You're going to transfer me to another\ndepartment now, right?
You're gone for one second and the clientele completely changes.
You're gonna pay for this!
You're hardly the talkative type, but you say\nsmart things when you do talk.
You're headed to lunch now too, right?\nWhere do you usually eat?
You're here again, {NAME1}-kun!\nYou're pretty dedicated, huh?
You're here doing me a solid, so this one's\non me!
You're here for this, right?
You're holding back! Remember, the dummy is\nyour enemy!
You're holding it wrong! Just close your eyes\nand let your inner pool shark guide you...
You're hungry? I'm sorry. Look, there's some\nleftover food I got from work in the fridge,\nokay?
You're important to me too.|I respect your skills.
You're in college, aren't you, Yaoling? Are\ncocktails popular with the kids in China?
You're in fine fettle today.
You're in perfect harmony!
You're in the same class as Motoha,\naren't you?
You're in top form.
You're inconveniencing the other students.\nCome over here for a moment.
You're incredible, Miyazawa-san. But I'd expect nothing less from a condemned Menace!
You're just a cold-hearted monster of a woman, aren't you?
You're just as reliable on the register.
You're just beaming, aren't you, Tomoko?
You're just out of shape, man.
You're just so... magnificent. I must\ncapture you.
You're keeping up well, {NAME1}-kun.\nI think you have a talent for music.
You're kidding! I dropped my train pass!?
You're kidding! So our attacks were all\nfor nothing?
You're kidding, right? It wasn't exactly\nsomething you could easily miss...
You're kind of a weird dude, huh? Whatever,\nit's cool. My name's Shun Kano.\nNice to meet ya.
You're kind of the only one I can ask to do\nthis. Plus, I'm a bit of a contrarian.
You're leaving already?|I still have so many questions...
You're lookin' hale and hearty, Pops.\nSometimes I stop by 'cause I'm worried.
You're looking for an old store?|What decade are we talking here?
You're looking rather pleased with yourself.
You're looking tired today, {NAME2}...
You're minors! What are you doing here!?
You're my hero. Now I can go to work\nwithout worry.
You're my...precious student...
You're no ordinary girl. Just like someone\nI'd expect {NAME1}-kun to know.
You're not a cop anymore. All the cops in the country are on\nyour tail and they're out to arrest you, not me.
You're not beating me.|You're doing plenty.|I still have a ways to go.
You're not going to sing?|Never mind.
You're not listening to me at all, are you?
You're not making any sense...
You're not sick, are you? You're here because you heard the rumors, right?
You're not well! You need rest or you'll...
You're not wrong, but that kind of family\ndynamic clearly isn't normal...
You're okay with that, right? Then\nlet's start...
You're on an artist's path, huh? I guess you\ncould say I'm pursuing a chef's path, then...
You're one fast learner. I think I've taught\nyou all I know!
You're one promising rookie. I hope to see\nyou around more often than not.
You're one to talk!
You're one to talk!|Shut your mouth!
You're one to talk. As her friend, what did YOU do?
You're one tough kid, you know that? Thanks,\nI feel a lot better now.
You're our homeroom teacher! Please come back\nto school soon!
You're overreacting! It's not nearly bad enough for that!
You're part of the Exploration Team too now,\nright, {NAME2}?
You're part of the club too, Mr. Higashino.\nI want our band to debut with one of\nyour songs.
You're predicting the next attack based on\ntheir movements! What discerning judgment!
You're pretty modest, huh? You should be\nmore confident in yourself! You did save\nmy skin this morning after all.
You're pretty motivated.|Sure you're not overdoing it?
You're pretty skilled, {NAME2}.
You're pretty tough.|You look lonely.|I'm by your side.
You're probably right, but...
You're probably right.
You're quiet, but I can picture you leading\nyour friends in battle, y'know?
You're quite tenacious...\nI guess I should get serious, too.
You're quite the wiz with that wire. It looks like we can make good use of that skill as we move forward.
You're raring to go.|You mean making up, right?|That's the spirit.
You're real sharp.\nIf I had to figure that out, I'd be screwed.
You're really brave, Tomoko.|It's all thanks to Motoha.
You're really getting the hang of this.\nI think you're ready to take more on.
You're really good, {NAME2}-kun! You really\njust started playing?
You're really helping me out... Seriously,\nthank you so much.
You're really obsessed, huh?
You're really still doing that stuff?
You're right about that. I'll come by when\nI'm feeling better then.
You're right about that. These bonds are\neternal.
You're right about that... One plate easily\nfeeds a table of three.
You're right!
You're right! It has to be.
You're right! She's a total Menace!
You're right! These shelves are missing one,\ntwo, three... Three books.
You're right! We're a couple of pros today!\nWe've got this!
You're right, even down to all the creepy\nparts. Doesn't it feel a little different,\nthough?
You're right, it's really quite...
You're right, unfortunately. This is the\nMetaverse, so these must be products\nof cognition.
You're right. A good, clear melody can be the\nbest way to convey a song's feeling.
You're right. Akashi-sama hasn't even come\nout here since holing himself up on the\nother side of the plant.
You're right. And I mean, I can't help but\nworry about the others who are missing.
You're right. And it should be safer with\nthis many people... Let's go.
You're right. Everyone's getting dragged\nalong by Miyazawa's opinion, so despite the\nobvious drop in quality...
You're right. I am somewhat at fault for not\nstopping her.
You're right. I guess we should go check\nout the camera.
You're right. I know we needed somewhere\nto run, but the middle of a Palace is really\nnot ideal.
You're right. I made a promise, after all.\nI've gotta go see her!
You're right. I'll try to be a little easier\non myself.
You're right. If I get down on myself over \nsomething like this, then what has my life\nbeen all about!?
You're right. If I get down on myself over\nsomething like this, then what has my life\nbeen all about!?
You're right. If I look closely, though...\nSomething's blinking on and off, right?
You're right. It was selfish of me to get so\ncarried away.
You're right. It's worth putting some more\nthought into this.
You're right. Let's get going.
You're right. Standing around thinking will\nget us nowhere. We must proceed.
You're right. Thank you, Lufel. Now, to\ncontinue explaining my thoughts...
You're right. The main dish is mostly veggies\nanyway. A little extra won't cause too much\ndamage.
You're right. There's no way around it.
You're right. We can't stoop to Kiuchi's level.
You're right. We may be able to destroy it.
You're right...
You're right... But I'm not a teen. I can't\nstop myself from worrying about him.
You're right... I haven't even played past\nthe intro yet.
You're right... I wasn't able to help her at all.
You're right... I'm sorry for making you\nlisten to all my silly problems.
You're right... Let's go down the stairs...
You're right.\nBut what if someone\ndecided to use that against her?
You're right.|Haven't we been planning already...?
You're saying I can have it? I... am...\nThat's... uh...
You're saying you believe in him?
You're skilled, but you've only just joined. You're struggling to make team plays, right?
You're so busy with school and all, but you\ntake the time to go shopping with me and\nstuff...
You're so kind, {NAME1}-kun.
You're so right, {NAME1}-san! I was thinking\nthe same thing.
You're so transparent...
You're so young! Cheer up a little!\nA positive attitude is everythin'!
You're so... considerate when you play.\nI noticed it with the tambourine, too.
You're still free to participate in other\nclubs too.
You're still kinda flat.|I guess old habits die hard...
You're still quite lacking in experience\nyourself, you know...
You're still talkin'. I'm waitin' for you to finish.
You're still young, buddy!
You're strong and determined. No objections here. You are welcome to join.
You're supposed to be an upstanding athlete. And yet here you are sucking face in public.
You're taking a picture of him?|Do you need permission for that?
You're the best. Thanks again!
You're the guy who was with Haruna\nearlier, right?
You're the intruders? Well you're not getting\npast this base. Not with me to guard it!
You're the one from the other day.
You're the one who had trouble getting\nthrough the hallway yesterday, right? But...
You're the one who went to the ramen shop in\nOgikubo with Kano-kun, right?
You're the only one qualified, Riko-senpai!\nYou've got my vote!
You're the problem! You're always so mean\nto Naruru!
You're the student who had a disagreement\nwith Ms. Katayama. Arai-san, was it?
You're the type who likes to taste the flavor\nof the beans alone then? Me too.
You're those devious intruders going\nafter Kiuchi-sama, aren't you?
You're truly one of a kind, aren't you,\nShun Kano-kun?
You're turning the wheel too much! No, not\nthis way! Watch out!
You're up, Wonder. You should be able to\navoid it all.
You're very good at school too, Shota...
You're very welcome.\nSo, where are you all headed?
You're welcome to drop in any time.
You're welcome to stay for as long as\nyou'd like.
You're welcome to use some of my bargain\nbonito flakes! Ahahahahaha!
You're welcome!
You're welcome.|Are you okay with a date?
You're welcome.|It was just a coincidence.|I'm glad we met.
You're welcome.|Nah, it was all you.
You're welcome.|You've already thanked me.
You're workin' here today too, huh?
You're wrong...
You're wrong.|It's not her fault.
You're young, {NAME2}-chan. I imagine you\ndon't go to the movies much either, right?
You're younger than me, but you've got it so\ntogether. I should learn from you.
You're younger than me. Oh boy...
You're, umm... Sorry, I can't remember your\nname at all.
You're... a much more skilled petter\nthan I expected. It's so nice, I could\ndoze... off... Mewhehe...

You've been doing the work I asked the\nacademic coordinator to complete, correct?
You've been good to us until now, so we'll\nlet this go without a police report this\ntime...
You've been such a good friend to me. I trust\nyou won't spread it around, yes?
You've certainly become an accomplished\ndumpster diver.
You've certainly got the spirit. I won't\nmake you wash dishes today, though.\nGot something else you can help with.
You've changed, Sis.
You've come to look for the orange tabby's\ntreasures?
You've developed quite a melodious singing\nvoice!
You've done so much for me. Because of my\ntalks with you, I was able to take a step\nforward.
You've doubled the amount, try again!
You've finished washing all those dishes...\nThis truly is a popular place.
You've got a good eye, {NAME2}-kun. I did\ndraw inspiration from dance for that.
You've got a lot on your plate, between going\nto school and being a Phantom Thief. Be sure\nyou get some time to rest.
You've got a point. We can use our savings\nnow, and I can keep working to save up\nmore for her later.
You've got a point... Guess my current job\nisn't so bad, is it?
You've got a real talent for finding lost\ntreasure. As long as it's for cats,\nI suppose...
You've got a river, greenery, and a range of\neateries... I could never get sick of\nexploring this place.

You've gotta be kiddin' me! Whaddaya mean\nyou lost the contract!?

You've had sufficient practice, so this all\nmust be a breeze for you.
You've heard about deep-sea fish, right?\nThey don't need to sense light, so they've\nbecome blind.
You've helped me improve my cocktails,\nmy mocktails, and even my flair tricks.
You've inspired me to face this.
You've pegged me pretty well... But I\u2014
You've prepared each order flawlessly.
You've probably made plans to meet your pals\nhere too a few times, I'm sure...
You've really changed, Ayaka.

Yui and I volunteered at the\nadmin's farm. We hosed down\nthe crops together.
Yui doesn't seem to have\nnoticed me. Should I\ncall out to her?
Yui seemed eager to show me\naround Harvest World Online...
Yui seems like she's back\nto her old self.
Yui seems really down.
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. I managed to steer\nmy way to a neighboring area.
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. I'm starting to get\nthe hang of it.

Yui's "friend" Matsukata\nis wondering if we can\nmeet in Shibuya.
Yui, Runa, and I had a lengthy\ndiscussion about Shichi-kun...
Yui-san?|Are you a french fry fan?|I'm Russet.
Yuki...
Yukimi and I ended up talking\nfor a while about how to be\nmore considerate...
Yukimi and I shared our\nfeelings about misused words\nthat are hard to point out...
Yukimi seemed unaware that\nshe was being quite bold. I\ngave her a vague response...
Yukimi-san is really earnest. I'm sure if I\nsit down and talk to her seriously she'll\nlisten, right?
Yukimi-san's just so put-together...
Yukimi-san, you said before that your wants\ndon't matter because listening to your mother\nis the right thing to do.
Yum!
Yumi and I made tasty\nmocktails at my place. It was\na drink to remember...
Yumi and I spent time alone\ntogether as she made me\nmocktails...
Yumi and I went back\nto my place.
Yuna-chan, Kyo-kun! Don't go off too far!\nYou'll get lost!
Yup! I'm a car, and parfaits are my gas!
Yup! We'll be with you every step of the way.
Yup! We've got to see how it looks on you!\nYour home's nearby, isn't it?
Yup! Your very own dedicated Tycoon\nplaying area!
Yup, I'd definitely die without parfaits!\nAhhh, chocolate that melts in your mouth\nis the best!
Yup, Pops's treatment of his customers\ninspired this ramen.
Yup, drown myself in hooch till I've\nforgotten whatever was bothering me.
Yup, leave it to me!
Yup, sure did!\nWe had to pull the chains to get past 'em.
Yup.
Yup. Even after you quit.
Yup. It's pretty popular, so you won't be able\nto get one without lining up early.
Yup. You could say they're both reformed\ndelinquents.
Yup.|Kinda.
Yusuke has talent.
Yusuke is borrowing Ren's room to work on\na painting for school. Apparently, he was\ntaken by inspiration...
Yusuke just burst in and collapsed from hunger...\nSaid he ran out of money for art supplies again.
Yusuke was so hungry earlier that he\ncollapsed. Make sure you're getting enough\nfood in you before you end up like him.
Yusuke!
Yusuke?
Zen-jou-in...? Preposterous... That secret technique was lost to time!
Zip it, Skull!
Zorro!
Zorro! Let's press the advantage!
Zoshigaya is such a nice and quiet place.\nMaybe my husband and I should move here.
Zucchini... could that grow at school?\nIt might be tough, but it's worth a try!
