The Self
Very soon the demon of terror will come knocking at the door. It waits in the darkness
With a healthy environment and proper care
Struggling forward along the path
Jumping into the murky depths
A castle may rise up in your dreams in just one night
With staff in hand
The sharp sword pierced through the still-beating heart. But now the blood is drying
In the midst of the chaos
When nothing changes
Receiving God's gracious blessings
Whether the future is good or ill
A sincere wish that the world will be free from violence and strife
As pain washes over you and you fight to catch your breath
Intense desires are finally calmed by the serene beauty all around. Amidst the incredible sense of relief
Draped in finery
An ever-evolving source of power courses through the body. It invigorates your fearless spirit and creates new life.
The winds and waves are ever-changing
Drowning in a beautiful dream both day and night
The laurel-crowned warrior returns in glory. All the pain and suffering of the past is reduced to dust amidst the triumphant cheers.
When the path is lost beneath entangled desires
The black current gradually recedes
In a world of fairy tales
Hesitation will only hinder your progress. Listen to your heart
The foggy path is choked with vines
The lion bathed in intense flames stretches its body. A joyous melody is heard and the light appears.
The fog is now lifted
When one can truly understand their own heart and know the place where they belong
A seedling sprouts from the soil
Take your desires in hand and form them into a spear
Spread your wings and soar into the sky. Your mind is free from doubts
The golden fields are bathed in sunlight. A knight in black armor lifts his weary head and gazes into the distance.
White lotus flowers bloom out of the mud. Seedlings buried too long in the darkness always yearn for the sky.
Shed the old shell of desire and reach out with both hands toward love and new life. Then you can spread your wings toward dreams of tomorrow.
When the spring arrives
Over towering mountains and across rushing waters
The sharp blade will never stop swinging. A fearless fighting spirit will cut through any chains that try to bind it.
The fierce flames roar and rage
She escapes from her prison
Rise on the wings of intuition and imagination. The noble steed raises its head
Your voice echoes alone through the dense fog. Away from the clamor of the world outside
