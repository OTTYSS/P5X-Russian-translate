Let's take a little rest.
1068005

1079012
1079013
1079014
1079015
1079016
1079017
Let's take five!
1079018
1079019
1079020
We should be able to go somewhere new.
1079021
1086001
Can we take a break?
1086002
1086003
1086004
1086005
It's so comfortable
1086006
1086007
1086008
1086009
1086010
1086011
1086012
1086013
1086014
1086015
but it was an interesting experience.
1086016
1086017
1086018
Even phantom theives need a break... right?
1087001
1087002
1087003
There are quite a few
1087004
shadows around. Let's keep
going.
1087005
1087006
I'll leave the decision to you
1087007
1087008
Everyone
1087009
Everyone
1087010
1087011
1087012
1087013
1087014
1087015
1087016
Stay vigilant.
1087017
How about taking a break soon?
1087018
1087019
Great job.
1087020
Should we go redeem them soon?
1087021
did they? Nothing escapes
my gaze.
1088001
1088002
Want to take a break?
1088003
1088004
1088005
It's a trap! Everyone
1088006
Let's try to find it!
1088007
1088008
What could it be?
1088009
1088010
This is the right place
1088011
Let's work hard together next time too!
1088012
1088013
Nothing gets past Nemertes!
1088014
1088015
1088016
1088017
I think it's about time you took a break.
1088018
1088019
1088020
1088021
1089001

1089013
1089014
1089015
1089016
1089017
1089018
we won't have energy to keep exploring.
1090001
1090002
1090003
1090004
Just when we needed it
1090005
1090006
1090007
It seems we won't be able to open it from here.
1090008
1090009
that there's treasure nearby!
1090010
1090011
1090012
We've arrived!
1090013
1090014
1090015
1090016
1090017
I feel a very unpleasant presence.
1090018
I request a short break
1100001
1100002
1100003
1100004
1100005
1100006
1100007
Let's try and figure out
how to get it open.
1100008
No one twisted their ankle
right?
1100009
something good nearby...
Let's look for it together!
1100010
This should help everyone out.
1100011
1100012
1100013
1100014
1100015
1100016
safely! Nice work
1100017
1100018
hard
 a break
1110001
1110002
1110003
1110004
Let an old gal get her rest.

But I won't lose.
1110018
but keep your elders in mind
and give us a break

1209402
1209403
1209404
1157221
a break... but I'd
get in trouble.
1157222
My footsteps echo loudly
again tonight...
1157223
my shadow.
1157224
no intruders...
Please
1157225

find them...
1157242
a magician!?
1157243
What am I supposed to
be monitoring?
1157244
break in here in
the first place?
1157245
more help around here?
I want a break...
1157246
have to guard this
godforsaken place?
1157247
something... A thief or a brat
anything will do...
1157248
Bring it on!
1157249
No one over there
either!
1157250
They are truly foolish!
1157251
fools! I'll smash
ya skulls open!
1157252
Should I

1157253

We're here! We're here!

There's a Shadow
This door is locked.
AAAAAA==
Justice has been served! *giggle* Our job is done!
There's something that looks important.
Oh my! Wonderful!
I feel like there's a hidden passage here.
We're here. What do we do now?
It's no use... This won't open.
*giggle* My heart is racing.
Well then
It looks really strong...
AAAAAA==
Everyone seems tired...

We're here! This is our destination
This is a nice spot for a safe room!
Hey
There's a Shadow. Be careful!
It's locked. Let's

Phew
What's that?
Finders keepers!
Huh? Do you feel a draft?
We're here. Now what do we do?
This door doesn't look like it opens.

Nice going.
Doesn't that seem kind of dangerous?
Isn't it about time we took a

Maybe I overdid it a little...
Okay

All right! Looks like this place is safe.
Good
There might be a Shadow
AAAAAA==
*groan* This door's locked

Booyah! Mission accomplished.
Hey
Heh! Hell yeah!
I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here somewhere.
AAAAAA==
Nice! We made it this far!
Hey
Oh? This is—
See ya
That one sure looks tough...
Hey... Can't we take a break already?
I got careless...
All right
Looks like... this is our destination.
Ooh
Okay! Let's take a break!
Hrm! Shadow spotted!
Huh? This door's locked

No Shadow readings.

That spot's fishy! Watch out!
There's a chest we haven't opened here.
Heh
There! Getting a Treasure reading nearby!
Let's go.
AAAAAA==
Target reached!
Oooh
AAAAAA==
We're here.
AAAAAA==
Hmmm... This room's suspicious.
 maybe?
It's locked! Maybe we
AAAAAA==
This one doesn't open.
There's a strong enemy around here!
AAAAAA==
We've been exploring for a while...
AAAAAA==
We've reached a good stopping
AAAAAA==
All right
Whoa
AAAAAA==
We've found a secret area!
This is not looking good!
Got to get refocused...
This is our destination.
There's a safe room over there.
We won't be found by the enemy here.
AAAAAA==
Enemy spotted. Let's proceed with caution.
It seems to be locked.
I'm glad we were able to finish things smoothly.
What's that...?
Whoa
There's something strange about this room...
So
It won't open... We shouldn't
AAAAAA==
What could be inside...?
We made it back safely.
AAAAAA==
That's a strong enemy... What should we do?
Don't overdo it.
AAAAAA==
Perhaps I... miscalculated?
Proceed with caution.
Here we are. Now then...
There's a safe room. Perfect timing.
Let's take a break and reorganize.
It's an enemy! Be on your guard.
It's locked?
Mission complete.
According to my calculations
AAAAAA==
Not a bad outcome.
There must be a secret path somewhere...
So far
Seems it won't open.
Let's see...
Mission complete. Let's call it a day.
This enemy seems very strong.
AAAAAA==
We should rethink our strategy.
I may need to pace myself...
Is everyone ready?
AAAAAA==
Here we are.
There's a safe room.
AAAAAA==
What should we do next?
Shadows ahead. Proceed with caution.
This door is locked.
AAAAAA==
Mission complete!
It's a treasure chest. Let's open it!
Oh
I hear wind... There might be a hidden passage nearby.
We're here. What's next
It doesn't look like we can get through here.
I wonder what's inside. Let's see!
Good work. Remember to cool down.
A strong enemy... Think we can handle it?
We should rest.
AAAAAA==
No! The invincible hero
 cannot fall yet!
Heroes assemble! Let's move out!
Oh? Is this our destination?
No enemy readings over there. Want to
AAAAAA==
Let's stop to recharge. Then
AAAAAA==
An enemy! Let's hit them with all we've got!
Even heroes need to take a detour sometimes...
AAAAAA==
Nice! We did it!
Hero senses activate! There
AAAAAA==
Just as I thought. Nailed it!
Hero senses tingling... There's a hidden passage around here.
I'm getting pumped! Let's go!
Dang
AAAAAA==
It must be something that'll make me stronger
Big haul today. Let's keep it up!
What an intimidating presence!
AAAAAA==
Learning to stay
AAAAAA==
*sigh* I feel quite tired...
Now then
So
Ah
Say... why don't we rest a little?
Enemy ahead.
It seems to be locked.
So this completes our job?
AAAAAA==
What is that?
Not a bad result!
This structure... There could be a hidden passage.
We've arrived. What do we do from here?
Hmm... Seems like we can't get in this way.
What's in here?
Well then
It seems to be a fairly strong opponent. Stay alert.
Setting the pace for the team
AAAAAA==
Are you guys exhausted
Time to get goin'.
Are we here?
Should we take a short break?
I could use a rest.
There's a Shadow.
It won't open... Do we need a key for this?
Nice work!
Hey
Don't mind if I do!
Isn't there any way to get through?
Where are we...?
Nope... Doesn't look like it'll open.
What do we got here?
I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.
Looks like a tough one...
Pushin' yourself too hard is no good
I might not make it...
Let's stay focused!
Here we are! Let's be careful
There's a safe room. Want to take a break?
Let's go over our situation.
Enemy up ahead! Watch out!
It's locked...
Phew... Mission accomplished.
Look! I bet it's something good!
Now that's worth celebrating!
I think there's a passage nearby...
What should we do next?
It won't open...
I wonder what's inside.
That's it for today. Good job
Oh no
AAAAAA==
Are you okay? Why don't we take a little break?
I'm not feeling so great...
Let's get going!
We're here!
There's an Oasis! Just kidding.
Phew. Wouldn't mind cooling off in a safe room.
Enemy spotted. We should probably be careful.
Is it locked?
Got it done!
I wanna know what's inside.
Wow
I feel a breeze... Is there a hidden path there?
Whoa
Hmmm
What is it? Something good?
That was pretty fun! See you next time!
A Shadow... And it looks strong. We should proceed with caution.
I'm getting a bit thirsty.
AAAAAA==
Um... Is now a good time to heal?
I hope this can provide some fleeting amusement.
Is this the place?
You can't neglect your rest.
The chosen one's sanctuary... I mean
A Sh-Shadow!?
It's locked...
I saw that one coming from miles away.
Hm? Is that the unmistakable aura of a rare item?
The chosen one will surely make the most of it.
I feel we are being guided by the unseen...
Is this our first time here?
It doesn't seem like we can open it...
Aren't you curious about what's inside?
If ever you need my power
AAAAAA==
I sense a formidable enemy approaching.
AAAAAA==
Even chosen ones need their rest.
AAAAAA==
I'm reaching my limit...
All right
This is the place.
Safe room!
AAAAAA==
Phew! Now we can relax.
Shhh! There's a Shadow!
Uh
All done!
I smell treasure!
Makin' bank!
Is there a secret passage around here?
Here we are!
Hmmm
What's inside?
All right
It looks pretty strong...
They say that balancing work and rest gives twice the results with half the effort.
AAAAAA==
Keep an eye on that HP and SP!
Hey
Whoa
Woohoo
Uhhh
AAAAAA==
Treasure chest nearby! Check it! ♪
Hm
Look! Treasure! It's so shiny!
Let's get this party started!
Mission complete!
AAAAAA==
Alrighty then
Go
Hmmm
It's locked? How annoying!
Ugh. It's not opening!
What the what now!? That one looks strong
You're not planning an all-nighter
AAAAAA==
Booyah! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Been there
We're absolutely rolling in tickets!
AAAAAA==
Hm? I think there's something here.
Sorry
AAAAAA==
Let's give it our best effort. Within reason
Well then...
Let's rest before we get too tired.
*sigh*
 I don't wanna leave.
Here's our chance to strike first.
The door is locked.
I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.
Treasure chests are so exciting
This is very nice.
This room feels suspicious somehow.
We all deserve a nice long vacation.
Doesn't seem it'll open so easily...
I hope it's something good.
I'm a bit tired
AAAAAA==
I did the best I could
It looks really strong... Are we still going to fight it?
No need to push yourself so hard.
AAAAAA==
We're still in danger. We should heal.
It's a safe room. Let's make use of it.
Shadows ahead.
 so let's proceed with caution.
There don't seem to be any
AAAAAA==
Something feels off. There might be a trap.
It looks like there's a treasure chest...
 Wonder.
I see
The Treasure is close...
 are you ready?
Let's get exploring.
 stay sharp.
This looks like our destination. What's next?
Mission accomplished. Good job
Seems we've arrived. Where should we start?
I detect a hidden passage. Try to find it.
Looks like it's locked.
Seems it won't open... Let's find another way.
I've detected a strong enemy.
AAAAAA==
Long periods of concentration are inefficient.
AAAAAA==
We did it. Let's keep up this momentum.
We've fully explored this area.
AAAAAA==
We've accumulated quite a few tickets.
AAAAAA==
Thought they could hide
AAAAAA==
Taking care of your health is important too
Oh
AAAAAA==
That's a lot of enemies... Will we be okay?
It seems like there aren't too many enemies.
I have a bad feeling about this...
 be careful.
There's something good nearby.
AAAAAA==
Oh. What do we have here?
There's something super powerful ahead!
AAAAAA==
Let's go!
Here we are! 
 isn't it?
Great job today!
AAAAAA==
So
There's a hidden passage here.
AAAAAA==
Looks like it's locked...
Huh? It won't open.
That one is definitely strong... What should we do?
Um
AAAAAA==
You're doing great
If the map says we're here
It looks like you've gathered a lot of tickets.
Nothing gets by me!
Oof
Here we gooo! This is so exciting!
Goal!
We can rest over there!
Let's take it easy!
Shhh! We'll get caught!
It won't open without a key.
Exploring was fun!
Ooh
We found the treasure!
This room's pretty suspicious...
Whoa! So fast!
Why won't this door open?
I wonder what's inside!
That went well!
I want to come back and play again!
That enemy looks really strong!
If we don't rest soon
AAAAAA==
This situation seems dire...
Now then
We've arrived. Now then...
Safe room!
 too.
Let's take a break.
It's a Shadow... What shall we do?
It's locked.
AAAAAA==
Hard work equals bountiful harvest!
My intuition says
AAAAAA==
Ah! It's just what I wanted!
There must be some way we can make progress...
Traesto! ♪
AAAAAA==
It's shut tight. Shall we take another route?
I sense a most excellent harvest!
Simple as that!
Let's call it a day!
Oh?
AAAAAA==
I'm exhausted!
 please!
I... can't move...
Hope it's something good!
Here.
Safe room! Should we rest a bit?
Let's take a break. We should mind our health.
The enemy... Be careful.
It's locked...
AAAAAA==
Great job

AAAAAA==
Seems like there's
AAAAAA==
Yep
AAAAAA==
It looks like there may be another path.
Made it safe and sound.
We can't get through here? Let's try somewhere else.
I really hope it's something good!
All finished!
I'm glad we made it back
 everyone.
That one looks difficult! Don't push yourself too hard.
It's great you're working
 but don't forget to take
 okay?
Granny's not as spry as she used to be.
Let's search every nook and cranny.
We've made it. This is the place
This is a safe room
AAAAAA==
Phew. This is too much at my age.
There's an enemy here... let's rush 'em!
Can't we just kick it open?
Well done indeed! Very nice work.
Looks like treasure ahead!
It's our lucky day
Oh? Isn't this a passage?
Oh
Looks like it might be a good idea to call it here...
Wonder if something good's in there...
Nice job
It seems this is as far as we can go for now.
It's normal to hit a few
AAAAAA==
Glad to see you're energetic
 would you?
Sorry... I think I'd like to rest a little...
I wonder what'll happen today. I can't wait!
Hehehehe... We've arrived.
Look
Phew... This place is pretty chill.
A Shadow... Wonder
Hmmm... looks like it's locked.
What an adventure
Hey
Wow
Hear that whooshing sound? Is there a secret passage?
Here
Guess we gotta go the long way...
Find anything good?
Mission complete! Good work.
Well
That one looks pretty strong...
Aren't you pushing yourself

Shadows. Be cautious.
Can we get in from the other side?
AAAAAA==
There's a chest! I wonder what's inside.
Hehe

We've arrived. Wonder. What should we do next?

Are you going to end it halfway through?
Giving up halfway is so frustrating...
It's settled!
Game set!
Big catch!
Use adjustment next time.
I did the thing!
I've got this!
Closer
You talking about beach volleyball?
AAAAAA==

Let's make this the best summer ever!
Ready! Here I go!
Let's go!
All right! I got this!
Let's have ourselves a blast!
AAAAAA==
Aww
Let's run that one again!
Time to take a breather!
Got it. I'll be right back!
Huh? Are you returning already?
Yeah
Good to see you!
That was a breeze!
Nice! Found a treasure!
That was a bit of a hard fight!
Leave it to me.
Got it. I'll take care of it.
New job needs doing? Leave it to me.
You want me to join?
Now? All right
Got it.
Let's go.
Okay
All right
Sure am hungry...
Damn! That's embarrassing!
*gasp*... I'm exhausted...
I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.
Pushing yourself too hard is bad for your health
Let's think about what to do when we get back.
Nice work!
How's it going?
Haha!
What do you think? Good
Man... that was pretty rough
Preparations complete. On your signal
Ready when you are!
My turn.
I am indeed ready.
It seems you need my power.
Exploration start. Keep on your toes
Wind
I suppose we should get serious
Everyone
It's my turn. Very well.
In other words... there are other priorities?
It's not over yet...
AAAAAA==
I see... I'll return immediately.
Reworking the plan? All right
To end so prematurely... that's regrettable.
Everyone okay? Good work.
Mission accomplished. Good job
All right... We did it.
Heheh... Mission accomplished.
My role is complete. I will leave the rest to you.
It's been left to me!
Is there anything I can do?
I'm with you.
I-I'll do my best!
What should we do next?
Let's stay focused.
Okay.
I'll do my best to keep up.
Got it! I'm off!
Look forward to it.
That's it for today. Good job
OK
You mean... there are other things to do?
Do you want to quit here?
Got it! I trust your judgment.
We did it.
Looks like a good harvest.
Not bad at all!
Phew... Mission accomplished.
This is great!
Do you... ever think about me?
I trust you.
Shift confirmed!
I'll serve up a full course!
Let's make this a summer to remember!
Let's get going!
I'll go!
Here I come!
It's hot
It's been a while since I've had a summer break this fun.
I'm okay. I'll return soon.
All right
I wanted to keep going until the end...
What? It's not over yet though...
You're saying... it's okay to end it right here?
Got it done!
That was pretty fun! See you next time!
That was an easy win!
I'm really tired!
*giggle* We accomplished a lot today.
There is no need to fear.
I won't betray your expectations!
My pleasure.
I'll do my best.
I'm not going to let you down.
Got to get refocused!
I'll give it my best shot.
Leave it to me!
Understood. I'll give it my all.
Leave it to me.
I'm getting a bit tired. Let's take a break.
What a shame.
So it goes... Understood.
...So you're saying that I should give up halfway through?
Understood. I am on the way.
I'm glad we were able to finish things smoothly.
So
AAAAAA==
A fair reward for the work.
This is the result of everyone's hard work!
Stay humble in the face of victory.
All prepped. We can go at any time.
My turn.
You need my power?
Looks like this is where I come in.
Everything's ready to go.
Let's all give it our best.
Is everyone ready? Let's go.
Peak Condition!
I think I can do it.
I'll never let you down!
But I'm still not done yet...
No way... we're going back now?
Now that it's come to this... I feel a bit regretful.
Next time
Very well. I will return immediately.
Mission complete!
Oh
Here are your results.
Good job. Remember to do a cooldown.
I sealed the deal
Did someone call for a hero?
Leave it to me.
I am at your command!
Is it my turn now?
Good choice!
Let's go
Heroes assemble! Let's move out!
I'm getting excited! Let's go!
I've got your back!
I was getting restless.
Let's stop to recharge.
AAAAAA==
Heroes don't give up that easily!
Hmmm
Understood. But
Understood. But
Justice... will prevail!
Nice! We did it!
Now
Big haul today. Let's keep it up!
Justice will prevail!
Leave it to me.
Preparations are in order. Ready to go whenever!
You made the right choice.
You've got quite the discerning eye.
I'll help you out.
Understood. Proceeding as planned.
My turn!
Understood. I shall proceed with caution.
This job should be pretty easy.
I have no objections. I shall do as instructed.
We need to change our strategy.
Abandoning mission. I'll await your next orders.
We should rethink our strategy.
Is it really okay to stop here?
...Did I really make the right choice?
Mission complete.
Not a bad outcome.
We really outdid ourselves.
Mission complete. Let's call it a day.
Well done.
Ready to roll!

A Gal's grand debut!
Leave the support to me!
You've got pretty good taste!
Time for me to show off!
Let's raise the roof!
Let's get started!
Go
Showtime!
Woohoo
AAAAAA==
Totally wack! Let's bounce!
No way... We screwed up...
AAAAAA==
Uh... isn't this
Shouldn't we head back now? Like
What? This is such a bummer.
Mission complete! Let's celebrate!
Booyah! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Haha! That's so totally crazy!
Nice one
Most excellent!
Nice choice.
Me... Yeah
Here I go.
Am I up? Works for me.
Key... Ready to go!
I'm here! It'll all be okay!
The chosen one... attacks!
Key... here we gooo!
Hope this can cure my boredom.
I can see it now... Victory is in sight!
You can't neglect your rest.
As for this next mission... uhh
This is a tactical retreat... I think...
Even if you tell me to come back all of the sudden...!
This
 isn't it...
I knew it had to be this way
The chosen one will surely make the most of it.
I haven't even gotten
AAAAAA==
If you need my power
AAAAAA==
It seems I truly am the chosen one
Guess it's my turn.
Perhaps I should show you my mature side once in a while.
The pen is mightier than the sword
I'll keep doing my best.
It seems I was able to live up to everyone's expectations...
It's a bit of a hassle... but I guess there's no other option.
Let's do our best without pushing ourselves too hard.
Ahh
I'll treat it like a research trip.
Maybe I should show my motivated side now and again.
No matter the situation
I did the best I could
Let's rest before we get too tired.
Canceled. Well
I think it'd go well
All thanks to everyone.
It might be nice to go on a trip once in a while.
I'm a bit tired
AAAAAA==
This is very nice.
I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.
Just leave it to me!
Now it's my turn!
It's my time to shine!
I'm gonna bust some heads!
I've been waiting for this!
All right
I'm not some paper tiger
Well then
Okay! Let's go!
Heheh! I handled that easily!
What? But we're still on the way...
Huh? We're going back right now!?
I wanna keep going till the end next time!
These... don't seem to be fully burned...
What? That's...
Makin' bank!
Whoa
All right
All done!
Wow! This is great!
It's the best choice!
Just leave it to me♪
My batteries are fully charged!
It would be preposterous
AAAAAA==
Leave it to Bui!
I'm taking you down!
Let's get going!
My excitement is growing!
Would you like to change your preferences?
I'll live up to your expectations!
We made it back! Should we take a break?
Is it okay to leave it unfinished?
Canceled!? What's going on here!?
I request an explanation...
We haven't even finished sowing the seeds...
Easy-peasy.
A natural result... An insult is in order!
Ah! It's just what I wanted!
Wonderful!
Let's call it a day!
Leave it to me.
Time for Riddle!
I'll do my best!
Should I be getting this hyped!?
Exploration team
Ready?
I'll give it my all!
Here we go! This is so exciting!
Now what's happening!?
I'm so pumped!
All right
Can we go back?
Over already? Why?
I want to come back and play again!
Aww
That was too easy!
That went well!
Exploring was fun!
Did I do a good job?
Wow
I got this!
All ready!
Marian
Leave the healing to me!
I'll do my best
Hope it's something good!
Let me heal you!
I will protect everyone...!
I can fight too.
I'll go above and beyond!
I'm sorry... If only I could've done a little better...
Okay! I'll go back now then.
What!?
I think I'm a bit tired...
Huh? We're only halfway but... Is it okay?
All finished!
Yep
AAAAAA==
Great job

AAAAAA==
I'm glad we made it
AAAAAA==
Hehehe! That went well!
I heard your call!
Hah
You'd do well to listen to your elders
You got good taste
And they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Let's search every nook and cranny.
Let me show you what this granny can do!
Well done indeed! Very nice work.
Leave it to granny!
It's that easy!
It seems this is as far as we can go for now.
Phew. This is too much at my age.
Guess I'm getting older...
How disappointing.
I wanted to see it through till the end...
Wonder if something good's in there...
It's our lucky day
Well done
Nicely done. Grandma's happy!
A piece of cake
You can leave this to me.
Looking forward to it! Let's do this!
Okay. I'll be counting on you.
Let's give it our all.
I look forward to working with you all!
Let the show begin!
I'll make it the best show ever.
Okay! Where are we off to today?
What a thrill
Okie! Let's move out!
I think that's enough

AAAAAA==
Eh? Come back...? What's up?
Stopping here? But that's...
I don't want to up and give up right in the middle
Sorry...
A toast to our victory!
AAAAAA==
Wasn't that the best show ever? Hehe.
Yaaay!
With this
Aren't you glad you relied on me?
Leave it all to me!
Hey there! What can I do for you?
Okay! Let's do this!
I'll do my best to support you!
I'm kind of nervous all of a sudden... No
Ladies and gentlemen
Let's go!
Let's get serious!
Leave it to me!
And that should do it. Mission accomplished.
I'm sorry... I wasn't strong enough...
Uh
AAAAAA==
If only I had finished up a little faster...
Big bro
Next time
Let's do it!
Great job today!
AAAAAA==
Hehehe.
I did my best! What did you think
Yay! This is fun!
I'm all set!
Here I come!
Um... I look forward to working with you today...
Let's put on a good performance.
I'm up... Please don't get nervous...
From now on
I wonder what'll happen today. I can't wait!
All right
Time to start the show.
Stay tuned. Just you wait.
Well
I-I'm sorry!
But... it's not even over yet...
Huh? You want to retreat?
How the...?
A good experience. Nicely done.
Mission complete! Good work.

Purr-haps it's my time?
Looks like this is where I come in!
Behold my fur-someness!
All right
I'll be the ground to your feet!
Come on

No—!
Damn! They're tough!

I'm all warmed up!
You better brace yourselves!
Woo! I'm all fired up!
I'll handle it!
You just watch me!
Now it's really heating up!
That one's on me...
For real!?
Aaagh!
Damn... We're done for...
I'm sorry...
It's over!
Booyah! Mission accomplished.
We made an absolute killing!
BANG!
Woo-hoo!
Got it! I'll take this guy down!
You can count on me!
My turn? I'm always ready to go!
Huh? You called?
Okay! Leave it to me!
I won't hold back!
Go all in!
I need to let loose!
Finally
No!
No way!?
What the hell...? I can't believe this...
You're kidding
How could this happen?
We knocked it out of the park
Phew
Finder's keepers!
Good work.
Heheh
I got this!
Got it!
I won't let you down.
Hmm... Intriguing.
This could make for some good inspiration.
Preparations complete.
Let the battle begin!
My blade is ready!
You got it.
Let's take 'em down.
What!?
I was careless.
A shame.
Until next time.
No artist is made in a day!
Another step closer to achieving my dreams.
Simply breathtaking.
Job done and beautifully executed
Yes
Looks stupendous!
How stupendous!
Here I go!
Take on the challenge.
You need my power.
Just say the word.
I've got you covered.
Queen is good as golden.
This one's got my name on it.
Let's finish them in one fell swoop!
My fists are dying to punch something!
Seriously...?

Every lesson makes me stronger.
This might get tricky.
