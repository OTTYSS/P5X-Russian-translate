Maybe I should give them
a chance.
100022
jump scares...
100023
be a Phantom Thief
I'll need some gall.
100024
my mental fortitude.
100025
you when I'm done watching.
100026
freaking good?
100027
100028
a lot lately...
100029
the amount of calories
in different foods.
100030
many. It made me so sad.
100031
100032
they'll always end up
on my tray.
100033
my self-restraint.
100034
just exercise more to
compensate?
100035
Two birds with one stone!
100036
100037
in the workbook?
100038
after tomorrow
100039
100040
I knew it! Nooo!

I'll give that a go tonight.
100052
more than just training.
100053

{NAME2}.
100054
to your expectations!
100055
100056
I've got this.
100057
tomorrow too! Talk soon!
100058
late for school.
100059
100060
Just my luck lol.
Actually slept like a log.
100061
remember the sleeping tip
you gave me?
100062
My sleep's never been better!
100063
all worried.
100064
100065
100066
What am I worrying for?
100067
lately. I need to get it
together.
100068
during my run today.
100069
that could've been me
practicing in the field.
100070
100071
100072
100073
all the fun times I had while
playing baseball.
100074
100075
being a Phantom Thief.
100076
best lives every day!
100077
see you tomorrow!
100078
100079
100080
100081
a lot of power when
I admire someone.
100082
person to want to stand next
to the one I admire.
100083
comes from
thought about it until now.
100084
once I started thinking
about it.
100085
100086
100087
so hard now is because
of the person I admire.
100088
that's what it means?
100089
own question already
100090
you really are amazing.
100091
Let's give it our all
tomorrow
100092
100093
100094
100095
100096
100097
100098
a kid sometimes.
100099
that it isn't true
{NAME2}.
100100
I get riled up like this?
100101
100102
100103
100104
argument that I'm childish!
100105
people thought of me.
100106
100107
than I know myself.
100108
100109
{NAME2}?
100110
a little better.
100111
100112
with how others see me
and how I see myself.
100113
doesn't get me anywhere.
100114
effort if I wanna become the
person I view myself to be.
100115
anything we learn at school.
100116
all the rules in baseball.
100117
100118
it's more like the rules are
ingrained in my body.
100119
squeeze all the information
into my brain.
100120
I guess they're infused with
my muscle memory?
100121
It's easier to remember
what you like.
100122
in history
forget a friend's birthday.
100123
if I didn't know the rules
of baseball.
100124
the same then?
100125
then maybe everything will
start sticking in my head?
100126
strategies out.
100127
homework...
100128
answer to the last question?
100129
100130
100131
100132
a major life question in
50 words or less.
100133
100134
wing it and not give a damn.
100135
answer to the type of person
I want to become.
100136
type of person I want to be...
100137
what I believe in?
100138
now. Thanks
100139
for film recommendations on
that streaming platform?
100140
100141
It was really good!
100142
so sad. I straight up cried
at the end.
100143
Thieves would've made me more
resilient to this kinda stuff.
100144
a ways to go.
100145
100146
I've let it all out.
100147
for some coaching!
100148
recs too. We can catch a flick
on the big screen next time.
100149
100150
on the streaming service
I signed up to.
100151
100152
100153
punch to the feels.
100154
caught in an endless cycle
of tears and laughter.
100155
100156
go from laughing to crying
so quickly?
100157
takes you on an emotional
roller-coaster.
100158
a Phantom Thief...
100159
over my emotions. Is that
called a poker face?
100160
put the show on now.
100161
finished watching it
{NAME2}.
100162
endurance contest to see
who can last the longest!
100163
on break today...
100164
randomly yelled...
100165
100166
100167
someone yell it out.
100168
100169
is cream soda.
100170
a single thing in class
all day because of it.
100171
100172
endless cream soda mind loop!
100173
myself together.
100174
to one right now.
100175
ice-cold cream soda!
100176
to my randomness.
100177
talking about in class today?
100178
100179
dating your best friend.
100180
about dating
100181
say about whether they'd
give up or give in.
100182
answer
what to say.
100183
would you date
your best friend?
100184
100185
friend with a kind heart
{NAME2}.
100186
like you! Once you lock on
you never lose your target!
100187
that makes me glad.
100188
See ya tomorrow!
100500
100501
100502
100503
100504
Maybe some other time.
100505
on the spot
know when you're free.
100600
the new films that were just
added to that streaming site?
100601
they'd totally be your thing!
100602
let's discuss which ones
to check out!
100603
100604
where to find me!
100605
I'll be at my usual spot
if you're free.
100606
busy. No rush
know when you have time.
110000
of the Phantom Idols?
110001
of cognition
strength of a Phantom Thief.
110002
whether they succeed or fail.
110003
110004
has been worthwhile.
110005
to their fullest potential.
110006
110007
110008
you share many traits.
110009

110010

110013
spell that charms people.
110014
potential to raise desire.
110015
110016
110017
The inner workings of such a
spell remain a mystery to me.
110018
that your skill is not
to blame.
110019
to reattempt the spell with
the pose for me.
110020
your capabilities.
110021
I have looked into
concept cafés.
110022
referred to her establishment
as an "idol con café."
110023
an employee there.
110024
110025
conviction within her.
110026
qualities I seek in an idol.
110027
makes little to no difference.
110028
110029
understanding.
110030
please learn to be more
like her.
110031
on idol photo shoots...
110032
a photo with your idol.
110033
is of vital importance.
110034
110035
worries me terribly.
110036
idol
110037
Thieves
your allies and build trust.
110038
follow Naruru's example.
110039
110040
for you. Be diligent.
110041
the other day...
110042
understand Naruru's charm.
110043
110044
That is what is most
important.
110045
proceeding smoothly.
110046
What one likes,
one does well.
110047
and our contract will
proceed swimmingly.
110048
110049
as a fellow fan.
110050
Naruru's charm another time.
110051
live-action hero shows?
110052
them before rising to fame.
110053
110054
while strolling Akihabara.
110055
faces
who they were.
110056
a live-action hero?
110057
110058
with such names.
110059
further investigation.
110060
these "live-action effects."
110061
of a producer.
110062
and key partner.
110063
an idol's career depends
on them.
110064
even the most talented idol.
110065
110066
no doubt this issue
will be resolved.
110067
for his change of heart
to be reflected in reality...
110068
continue to support
Naruru as a fan.
110069
one's loyalty is tested.
110070
I "like" Naruru's posts on
the café's social media.
110071
to see Naruru.
110072
attire. Instead
convenience store uniform.
110073
110074
or place to approach her.
110075
private inquiries are taboo.
110076
private inquiries are taboo.
110077
share details of
the store's location.
110078
110079
110080
Naruru to find peace.
110081
about live-action heroes?
110082
a popular title called
Phoenix Ranger Featherman.
110083
success for many hopeful
actors and idols.
110084
join their ranks...
110085
live-action heroes further.
110086
110087
you and other humans.
110088
I will persevere.
110089
cooperation.
110090
apparently has many
installments.
110091
110092
110093
shows are made for children.
110094
as they age.
110095
continue to watch even
into adulthood.
110096
an adult filled with such
a bountiful desire.
110097
110098
inexperienced actors
110099
a satisfying sight.
110100
supporting one's idol.
110101
when you have the chance.
110102
assistance with Naruru.
110103
lost her smile.
110104
110105
my expectations.
110106
a complete change of heart.
110107
is his true character.
110108
110109
without desire.
110110
it invites ruin upon oneself
and others.
110111
will exercise due caution.
110112
yielding to it... That is my
sincere wish for you.
110113
who informed us of
Naruru's plight?
110114
continue to visit Naruru.
110115
I also enjoy their company.
110116
the term "fan" to describe
my relationship with them.
110117
110118
No
110119
the notion.
110120
would it not require the unit
to consist of multiple idols?
110121
if the three were to
form a group...
110122
rising within me.
110123
to something greater?
110124
answer together.
110125
110126
of "Meow 3 Stars"
for a unit name?
110127
110128
of Naruru and her coworkers
becoming an idol group.
110129
Naruru would be
in the center.
110130
on either side...
110131
110132
Please memorize them.
110133
110134
to succeed.
110135
110136
my loss of composure.
110137

my duties.
110139

110140
discovered an incredibly
enchanting individual.
110141
public eye
to the spotlight.
110142
brighter than ever.
110143
during her time away?
110144
investigate her life
pre-hiatus.
110145
110146
misleading comments.
110147
transformation as an idol.
110148
a secret from Naruru.
110149
was truly splendid.
110150
idols and fans shared
one heart and mind.
110151
my own misconception.
110152
to show us dreams
believe I was dreaming.
110153
110154
gods within nature
110155
in idols like Naruru.
110156
for both you and Naruru.
110157
since I became your concierge.
110158
than I ever imagined.
110159
a concierge to sing
her own praises.
110160
to you in the slightest
then I am satisfied.
110161
110162
got the better of me.
110163
tremendous growth.
110164
110165
I am grateful enough
as your concierge.
110166

110167
110168

understand your true self.
110501
is not bound by the terms of
our contract. What do you say?
110502
110503
in front of the Velvet Room.
110504
110505
110600
we do something that differs
to our usual meetings.
110601
details of this proposal
when we meet in person.
110602
110603
in front of the Velvet Room.
110604
you are interested

110605
you are interested
not have other arrangements.
120000
way home today
120001
normies suspicious
before they could notice.
120002
120003
revealed myself?
120004
on the next occasion.
120005
abandoned building near
our school that's cursed.
120006
are tingling... It's like I'm
being drawn in...
120007
120008
to agree to join me!
120009
120010
120011
120012
120013
protect our real identities.
120014
{NAME1}-san?
120015
120016
people see me?
120017
But still...
120018
120019
other worlds?
120020
120021
to know
120022
different expressions in the
corners of a room at midnight...
120023
world. Or so they say...
120024
{NAME1}-san?
120025
120026
You've got to tell me
about it!
120027
What fascinating news!
I must do more research!
120028
120029
120030
120031
true name in enemy territory.
120032
the Hero of Light?
120033
conceal their true identity.
120034
Haha
It's perfect...
120035
by the way.
120036
120037
forces of yin and yang working
in unison
120038
Prince of Darkness
from now on
120039
you can just use my real name.
120040
the cursed video?
120041
about it today...
120042
depths of the web. I'm sure
it's the real thing.
120043
We need to see what
it's all about!
120044
120045
another time
120046
120047
I'm not scared
it's just...
120048
I swear! Or I wouldn't ask
you to watch it with me.
120049
to stick together for stuff
like this! Safety first!
120050
have you heard of
the man-faced dog?
120051
120052
way back in the day.
120053
for an old legend like that
to be popular now...
120054
been floating around
the web recently...
120055
but about a dog-faced man
not a man-faced dog!
120056
of a guy with a dog's head
driving a car!
120057
120058
the possibility.
120059
the photo.
120060
investigation. I'll let you
know if I find anything.
120061
I have a status report!
120062
case I mentioned before.
120063
120064
head of a dog!
120065
online
120066
that same image again.
120067
just an illusion created
by the camera angle...
120068
the driver and his dog.
120069
120070
made it hard to separate
fact from fiction.
120071
ability to see through such
illusions. I must train more.
120072
I think I...
120073
120074
120075
bookstore when I came across
an old book covered in dust.
120076
I accidentally read a
line from it out loud...
120077
demon-summoning rituals!
120078
I read an incantation to
conjure some devilish fiend!
120079
at any moment...
120080
what should I do!?
120081
120082
get scared before it
even appears!
120083
than I expected
{NAME1}-san.
120084
to some demon...
120085
chosen ones!
120086
that demon-summoning spell.
120087
I haven't even sensed
anything unholy.
120088
120089
reading the book after that.
120090
an incantation isn't enough
to summon an evil entity.
120091
behind it.
120092
it. I hope a demon appears.
Actually
120093
120094
I'm half afraid
half excited... Heh.
120095
to you
120096
120097
120098
directly into your mind...
120099
looking at right now?
120100
120101
120102
telepathy is difficult.
120103
120104
{NAME1}-san.
120105
to awaken in time!
120106
120107
to say that!
120108
telepathic abilities.
120109
Hehehe.
120110
120111
120112
120113
understand your feelings.
120114
sense my emotions?
120115
I can feel my telepathic
skills awakening.
120116
to get my hands on psychic
training tools.
120117
until I harnessed my powers.
120118
120119
compete with you.
120120
just now!
120121
greater than mine.
120122
120123
120124
120125
120126
and you blend in so well
with normies.
120127
your style as a point of
reference for my new look.
120128
120129
want to be overly conspicuous.
120130
for some time now
120131
I'd appreciate it...
120132
now. See you tomorrow!
120133
of curiosities...
120134
people don't take notice...
120135
120136
to be found everywhere
you look.
120137
to it all so easily!
120138
talks about Menaces.
120139
chosen ones like us...
120140
remember what it's like
to feel real wonder.
120141
120142
what I'm saying?
120143
the eyes of the masses!
120144
{NAME1}-san!
120145
Hero of Light.
120146
to fulfill our purpose
however we can!
120147
{NAME1}-san!
120148
to summon a spirit of
good fortune...
120149
120150
usually visible to the
human eye
120151
and I thought a lucky spirit
would be more useful anyway.
120152
worked properly
120153
of guidance
120154
old folks
120155
five different people I had
to save... I'm exhausted.
120156
120157
I suppose a little praise
is nice... Heh.
120158
you know the spell was fake.
120159
to try next time
120160
how it goes.
120161
I must apologize...
120162
great quest has appeared...
120163
120164
transferring at the end
of the month...
120165
picked as the replacement.
120166
the position at first
120167
over-the-top types
in class got behind it...
120168
class president.
120169
120170
surprisingly!?
120171
a chosen one
120172
way of my true purpose.
120173
can be useful. I intend to put
in the appropriate effort.
120174
{NAME1}-san?
120175
120176
in a never-ending battle to
stay informed
120177
print and online ensure our
knowledge is kept up-to-date.
120178
books from all over the world.
120179
data collection
120180
120181
speaking to the freshman who
got the top grades in English!
120182
but speaking is a bit rough.
120183
translating a grimoire soon.
120184
when I'm finished.
120185
{NAME1}-san?
120186
120187
embarrassing
120188
test for math soon.
120189
basics of numerology
but equations...
120190
you might be able to
instruct me
120191
120192
120193
chosen one for nothing!
120194
120195
someone for something
like this before.
120196
and restore my honor!
120500
A new threat has emerged
and I'm going to gather intel.
120501
hot spot. Can you come?
120502
120503
Let's go investigate.
120504

120600

130000
what do you look for
in a part-time job?
130001

130002

130003
130004
I think it's the same for me.
130005
what's around.
130006
{NAME1}-kun?
130007
130008
130009
jealous. I wish I was in the
same class as you guys.
130010
together sometime!
130011
you live by yourself
130012
That must be tough.
130013
130014
alone is like?
130015
to help
130016
on streaming services
{NAME1}-kun?
130017
videos online until recently.
130018
felt like it since I broke
my shoulder...
130019
about this one streaming site
so I signed up.
130020
what movies my other friends
are watching.
130021
like
130022
130023
one or two when I have
the time.
130024
recommendation!
130025
I've given them a watch.
130026
time
130027
spent my free time hanging
with friends.
130028
my teammates...
130029
I hardly get a chance to
invite them out.
130030
in my position?
130031
130032
130033
130034
you to talk like this
from time to time?
130035
130036
130037
I'll catch you later.
130038
130039
from my part-time jobs.
130040
mom and dad something
with the money.
130041
too
130042
130043
130044
sort of things they like.
130045
anything's good if I ask...
130046
130047
130048
more thought
130049
what's your take on
spicy food?
130050
130051
that diner in Shibuya.
130052
hot n' spicy original menu.
130053
and made some crazy dishes.
130054
the towel after one bite...
130055
not even the guys who
cooked it!
130056
not even the guys who
cooked it!
130057
for some taste testers...
130058
{NAME1}-kun?
Think you can take the heat?
130059
130060
That's the right call
no matter how you slice it.
130061
I said anything! I'm asking
too much of you.
130062
something like this. I mean
my manager literally fainted.
130063
spicy
130064
eyesight
130065
130066
130067
130068
I hit the books too hard.
130069
good back when I was
playing baseball...
130070
it's only getting worse.
130071
130072
130073
are keeping my eyes
in peak condition...
130074
not too late to get my
visual acuity back.
130075
cages in forever
130076
to make sure it doesn't
get any worse!
130077
Motoha. She was like...
130078
130079
thing about tutoring...
130080
130081
130082
quite something.
130083
said than done
130084
compartmentalizing things.
130085
teachable chunks
is hard.
130086
some way
130087
130088
techniques was pretty easy!
130089
how I study for exams?
130090
something there. Thanks!
130091
130092
130093
congrats for Motoha.
130094
who put in all the work.
130095
when we used to play baseball.
130096
went about things back then.
130097
Motoha never forgets it.
130098
about how she took
the information in.
130099
our study session was
a breeze!
130100
130101
to call me that
130102
for the next study session.
130103
test period's coming up!
130104
130105
interested in women's
baseball gear?
130106
130107
anymore
130108
that was important to me.
130109
to do with my spare mitt
and stuff I don't need.
130110
the small side. Besides...
130111
for catcher these days.
130112
if I can't find any takers...
130113
130114
I bet I'll find someone
who wants it!
130115
to end up in the hands of
someone who needs it.
130116
I'll let you know
how it goes!
130117
spare baseball equipment!
130118
130119
Turns out it was the
perfect fit
130120
when she grows up!
130121
my positive energy into it
before handing it off.
130122
over it when I had to quit
playing baseball.
130123
just put it all behind me.
130124
it is a good thing... Maybe?
130125
130126
130127
I really do!
130128

130129
incredible... Can I tell you?
130130

130131
baseball player from
way back is there!
130132
130133
He is pretty old
130134
recognize him by name alone.
130135
my folks know it anywhere.
130136
130137
I kinda want to!
130138
I can't just barge in
on him.
130139
130140
baseball team the other day!
130141
on the team invited me
to come watch.
130142
They eked out a draw
somehow...
130143
suddenly caused huge problems.
130144
doing fine and... like...

130166
agreed to do it!
130167
130168
pretty loud
130169
130170
to perform was tough.
130171
Not really
130172
for cheering on Kotone-san?
130173
130174
130175
when I would step up to bat.
130176
music club know!
130177

130179
130180
music club over yesterday.
130181

it was.
130183
squeeze in a humblebrag about
getting autographs after.
130184
believe it?
130185
the song I chose...
130186

130188
happy than anything else.
130189
the competition!
130190
130191
about Kotone-san.
130192
competition is all anybody's
talking about.
130193
nasty comments as before...
130194
seem pretty excited
to see her return!
130195

130198
busy with practice
130199

see it! Together
130201

So

130604

usual spot if you're free.
140000
skin lately. I'm usually
careful with it
140001
of skincare routine
{NAME2}-chan?
140002
140003
I'm jealous that your skin
can look so good.
140004

140005
looking as beautiful as yours
{NAME2}-chan!
140006
140007
shop for the first time
in what must be forever.
140008
these days
to be a lot cheaper.
140009
140010
wouldn't know any different.
Another sign of the times...
140011
140012
I'm talking about?
140013
140014
media these days. Nobody sends
friends emails anymore
140015
abbreviate that I wonder...
Socmed pals, maybe?
140016
foremost
of good memories to come!
140017
140018
of them to their flip phones.
140019
when I was cleaning out
my closet.
140020
140021
dangling from people's phones
these days
140022
what would you do with it?
140023
140024
do the same
140025
but still cute. I'll find
somewhere else to put them.
140026
for advice. Thank you!
140027
Make sure you're eating
well-balanced meals
140028
a thing!? Do you know about
these
140029
one when I peeked inside.
140030
one when I peeked inside.
140031
the ones I remember using.
140032
a little nostalgic.
140033
140034
I was on my own.
140035
on a date
to one together next time.
140036
more comfortable using one
with someone younger with me.
140037
with my hubby first...
140038
140039
have codes that unlock
secret frames...
140040
140041
old-school.
140042
if you don't know what I'm
talking about.
140043
140044
some time
phones are amazing
140045
than the digital cameras
we had back in the day.
140046
for everything now
I can't believe it!
140047
apps are worth having.
There's too many...
140048
would recommend
{NAME2}-chan?
140049
140050
you can even read magazines
on your phone now!
140051
and hard to read though...
Is it time I got glasses?
140052
games. They're perfect for
killing time!
140053
though... I wonder if there
are any good ones.
140054
and find out! Thank you!
140055
You won't believe it!
140056
supermarket right now!
140057
but they're selling cartons
of eggs for 99 yen!
140058
it'd be such a waste to let
this chance pass you by!
140059
140060
getting a good deal!
140061
buying the best thing possible
at the cheapest price.
140062
aren't a housewife...
140063
the money in the world
140064
140065
mention it
be right.
140066
think about things...
140067
something today. Thanks
{NAME2}-chan!
140068
are getting along well
140069
time lately when we talk.
140070
140071
makes sense.
140072
getting along!
140073
140074
that you start worrying over
kids who aren't yours
140075
without realizing.
140076
a youngster the space
they need is hard...
140077
talk to you because you're so
mature
140078
to keep in touch with both me
and Leo-chan
140079
140080
of your eyes and the length
of your legs now!
140081
the booths we had when
I was growing up.
140082
140083
I took them with my hubby!
140084
back in high school again!
140085
they're called! Filters!
140086
It's like I was a high school
girl again!
140087
It made mine almost a bit
too pale
140088
the time back in high school.
140089
if they'd let me adjust the
makeup and skin a little...
140090
was a photo booth that let
you look all nice and tan?
140091
do with the pictures they
take at photo booths anyway?
140092
was fun
anywhere to display them.
140093
your photos to
{NAME2}-chan?
140094
140095
case! Yeah
like the trend these days.
140096
changed. Okay
budget planner they go!
140097
of what we used to do
when I was at school!
140098
special photo albums we bought
or trade them with each other.
140099
photos of our crush inside
our phone's battery case.
140100
It's like I've actually turned
back the clock or something.
140101
more photos
140102
together sometime
{NAME2}-chan?
140103
trip
140104
140105
140106
so well
tough on you
140107
today too. I'm all alone.
140108
place just feels so big when
it's just me
140109
living by yourself?
140110
140111
student. Not having your folks
around must have its perks.
140112
to some friends from my
student days for a change.
140113
of having the whole house
to yourself
140114
able to live alone at
such a young age.
140115
140116
140117
on his work trip
140118
the housework when
I'm by myself.
140119
making dinner
gets pretty sloppy too.
140120
Are you making sure to eat?
140121
140122
figured out! I could learn
from your example.
140123
falling short here
140124
when it's just you is tougher
than I imagined.
140125
everything we've got
140126
but thank you for helping
out Leo-chan.
140127
him
worked out.
140128
a whole other issue
if you weren't around.
140129
140130
sure you're still just in high
school
140131
older than me in spirit.
140132
were just a regular kid
in the neighborhood...
140133
do you need to go through to
end up as mature as you?
140134
140135
{NAME2}-chan!
140136
you'd never do anything bad.
140137
act like a bad boy
In fact
140138
you do act your age
every now and then.
140139
me
be a little more childish.
140140
Leo-chan already
going to be leaving.
140141
pack his things.
140142
so sad! It was the same
with my own son.
140143
was younger and finally
leaving home.
140144
the same way I do now.
140145
140146
never really get how much their
parents love them.
140147
able to fully understand how
their children feel either...
140148
cycle regardless of age.
140149
just suck it up and accept it.
140150
be the one having to watch
a young one leave the nest.
140151
wet blanket now
Sorry
140152
that is making me feel
kind of embarrassed...
140153
Oh
stays on your phone!
140154
{NAME2}-chan?
140155
140156
a desk
like handiwork? Cool!
140157
your cooking some time.
140158
these days when my hubby
is off at work.
140159
off doing his own thing
soon too...
140160
up some kind of hobby myself.
140161
that feels right for me.
140162
140163
stuff that I don't do anymore.
140164
hobbies
dreams or ambitions.
140165
before
that could be.
140166
I've felt like wanting to do
one day!
140167
starting to get some idea
of what I could try!
140168
I'll message you again later.
140169
the clothes I gave you?
140170
140171
Those are actually pretty
nice pieces
140172
work in fashion.
140173
a while now after meeting
my hubby
140174
I still have a sharp eye
when it comes to looks?
140175
your full-time stylist next!
140176
140177
to say no! Aww
Just leave it to me!
140178
just kidding
You're such a cutie!
140179
for you
look forward to!
140180
through online videos
when I'm bored...
140181
the minute I'm watching vids
of other peoples' pets!
140182
a dog person or a cat person
{NAME2}-chan?
140183
140184
floofy and cute!
140185
but caring for one is so
much work
140186
at home
140187
140188
I'm actually pretty jealous.
140189
right? You know you shouldn't
tease your elders!
140190
I suppose you do still have to
raise them
140191
to care for an animal if you
can't even care for plants.
140192
140193
140194
should get. Do you have
any suggestions?
140195
140196
All that color
my window!
140197
I bet it'd even help
spruce up dinner!
140198
work. I was relieved when
it was over
140199
look after something hasn't
completely gone away.
140200
be a bit too watchful when it
comes to you.
140201
with me. I hope I'm not
annoying you.
140202
140203
say that! Well
to even more meddling!
140204
the one looking after me?
140205
all the advice! I'll message
you again later
140210
140211
140212
140213
140214
140300
Do you have a second?
140301
advice on all kinds of stuff
right?
140302
you for some advice myself.
140303
coming out of nowhere...
140304
140305
140306
we meet outside in a bit?
140500
Are you free?
140501
I'd love to learn what teens
are into these days.
140502
140503
but are you able to come over
now?
140504
If you happen to have time
you know where I am.
140505
you have some time
140600
there's something that's
been on my mind lately...
140601
meet up and I could talk
to you about it.
140602
140603
but are you able to come over
now?
140604
have time. I'm sure you're
busy with other things
140605
150000
bonito
ginger
150001
150002
150003
150004
150005
with heartburn?
150006
heavy on the fat.
150007
150008
have somethin'.
150009
favor sometime.
150010
150011
light or heavy?
150012
150013
150014
what customers like. Ttyl.
150015
of the word "soy"?
150016
150017
150018
150019
150020
the Japanese word "shoyu".
150021
soya in the 17th century.
150022
It's why we call 'em soybeans.
150023
Japanese loanword.
150024
150025
Anyway
150026
staple food
150027
150028
150029
only bring up rice and bread.
150030
noodles for all three meals.
150031
150032
150033
understand that.
150034
huh. Like
150035
150036
at dinner today.
150037
150038
talked about a classmate.
150039
150040
I'd bring up customers
and coworkers.
150041
let her talk my ear off.
150042
makes sense.
150043
since I brought up a friend.
150044
asking about you.
150045
150046
and where we've gone.
150047
150048
about this stuff?
150049
me to bring you along.
150050
150051
so she might not be around.
150052
but if you really want to...
150053
150054
end a yakiniku course on?
150055
150056
with that.
150057
I'd eat all that meat...
150058
for noodles.
150059
150060
finish off with rice soup.
150061
ice cream or almond jelly.
150062
150063
matters most.
150064
about the word "soy"?
150065
150066
loads of them.
150067
Sahara just means desert.
150068
salsa means "sauce".
150069
means "cape" in Ainu.
150070
so much more to common words
than we think
150071
150072
stuff up
150073
There must be more.
150074
find more
150075
150076
150077
150078
into it more.
150079
foods and seasonings
tend to double up.
150080
are introduced to a country
and locals adapt the flavors.
150081
from that point of view.
150082
150083
how it'll make my food better.
I just can't stop.
150084
I want to try out everything.
150085
something interesting.
150086
run-down Chinese restaurant.
150087
were nothing special.
150088
really stood out.
150089
the place told me how
to make the marinade.
150090
get it right...
150091
150092
150093
seemed to dump everything in a
bowl and serve it up. So...
150094
curious. When it comes to
flavors
150095
150096
trying too hard. Is that
why it's good?
150097
150098
half at a time.
150099
it dissolve completely.
150100
marinade to taste so good.
150101
150102
I mentioned before.
150103
of flavor is what made it
so delicious.
150104
that all this time
to do was just wing it.
150105
150106
you
150107
Whenever you want.
150108
ramen to go with this pork.
150109
try out fermented food...
150110
or incredibly desperate.
150111
150112
150113
That takes guts of steel.
150114
out to be delicious and had
a great shelf life.
150115
Hell
at it.
150116
the right food for a while and
invented a tasty snack... Wow!
150117
150118
foods are cool
150119
150120
seasoned bamboo shoots.
150121
I'll let you try some.
150122
150123
the other day...
150124
150125
150126
150127
thought they would.
150128
around a bunch.
150129
Why'd they turn out so well?
150130
150131
down
150132
uncovering its mystery.
150133
I figure it out.
150134
It's been forever.
150135
of ramen I could make.
150136
150137
never before.
150138
150139
150140
150141
150142
a means to an end.
150143
150144
truly matters.
150145
helps me sort out how I feel.
150146
I hope you'll keep
lending me an ear.
150147
150148
150149
stuff. Mind hearing me out?
150150
150151
one's perfect
150152
just right.
150153
150154
truly satisfied...
150155
to decide how to enjoy
their meal.
150156
my best onto the customers.
150157
on their own what's best.
150158
150159
so I'm not sure.
150160
it out with you though.
150161
150162
150163
You got a moment?
150164
me
150165
150166
recipes I want to try out.
150167
the customer wants.
150168
150169
for my own flavor?
150170
the customers want to eat?
150171
150172
150173
150174
150175
flavor experience I can
for my customers.
150176
so worried about?
150177
Thanks
150178
150179
surprisingly friendly.
150180
mean by that?
150181
150182
a walking dictionary.
150183
150184
at talking to others.
150185
so surprised
150186
150187
but you're making me blush.
150188
150189
150500
150501
to develop my palate.
Wanna tag along?
150502
150503
150504
150505
150600
There's something
I gotta ask you.
150601
150602
150603
the situation first.
150604
usual spot
150605
I'll be at my usual spot
come by if you've got time.
160000
are you good at
waking up early?
160001
160002
an oversleeper. But hey
that's why we're friends.
160003
in the morning.
160004
to force my gears to
start turning.
160005
autobiographical manga?
160006
160007
fluff
160008
talking about nothing
160009
been good at making the
mundane sound so interesting.
160010
when I spot them in the
convenience store.
160011
green teas in Japan
I think about it.
160012
give it a try
160013
160014
warmer months
160015
by authentic Chinese food
the first time I heard it.
160016
the real deal! Not the dishes
tweaked for Japanese palates.
160017
these days. Want to go try
some together next time?
160018
160019
It'll be a great experience
for sure.
160020
are a bit different from
Chinese food here in Japan.
160021
you know! Different regions
have their own flavors.
160022
That tongue-numbing heat
is right up my alley.
160023
good restaurants nearby.
160024
thanks for all the things
you teach me!
160025
important when I spoke with
some school friends today.
160026
over rice!
160027
dishes where I come from.
160028
considered eating it the way
they serve it here—raw.
160029
Do you eat a lot of
raw egg with rice?
160030
160031
160032
160033
country are safe to eat raw.
160034
the Japanese do
160035
Japanese supermarkets
sell different stuff.
160036
how many bath salts
they stock in this country!
160037
hot spring minerals that
you name it.
160038
do you like
160039
160040
a bright
could lift your mood.
160041
keeps me moisturized.
160042
chock-full of hot springs.
160043
skin smooth
circulation
160044
pretty incredible
don't you think?
160045
some of these salts a shot.
160046
and see for myself!
160047
made me realize something...
160048
machines
160049
stores around practically
every corner...
160050
to all these machines.
160051
160052
Not sure if I agree.
160053
reputation for being polite
and I think so too.
160054
get things done without the
fuss of talking with anyone?
160055
160056
completely get it.
160057
Maybe I'm totally
off the mark.
160058
a little weird
I'll mull it over a bit more.
160059
words exist in Chinese too
but have different meanings?
160060
find it real interesting.
160061
160062
study in Japanese can mean
reluctance in Chinese.
160063
connection
160064
nuance exists in Japanese too.
160065
people have always been
reluctant to hit the books...
160066
if you ask me.
160067
160068
a joke the first time someone
said it.
160069
that this is an absolute gem
of a find. Haha.
160070
in touch with Mama.
160071
with an answer when she asks
me how university's going.
160072
here in Japan
my studies take a back seat...
160073
160074
I'm studying by living
everyday life!
160075
something that I've been
mulling over.
160076
I want to become.
160077
figured this all out before
I came to study
160078
know unless you try.
160079
to you
160080
with pride
my studies are going A-OK!
160081
I study abroad...
160082
much since I got here.
160083
but I admit it does
bother me a bit.
160084
160085
secretly expecting more
from me than Mama!
160086
constant nagging any day
over a ticking time bomb!
160087
their faith in me?
160088
feels even heavier
160089
I have to show good results
hasn't changed a bit.
160090
in trouble if I don't
after all.
160091
grindstone
160092
160093
that the Chinese first arrived
in Japan centuries ago.
160094
settlement in the Hakata ward
of Kyushu 1000 years ago!
160095
160096
Japanese people from the
Goto Islands in Nagasaki...
160097
on the regular.
160098
neighbors
think about it.
160099
find it so incredible.
160100
Hakata and the Goto Islands
sometime!
160101
160102
train all the way to Hakata
is brutal on the ole keister.
160103
or boat ride to the islands...
160104
to get from Hakata to
the islands
160105
wouldn't be much different
to two trips. Hmm...
160106
on my travels...
160107
in Yokohama
Nagasaki
160108
sometime. It'd be a whole lot
easier than going to Hakata.
160109
160110
homeland who made the trek to
Japan in search of something.
160111
what it is they came for.
160112
figure out what it is I want.
160113
give me a few hints.
160114
more I need to learn about
this country.
160115
choosing to settle here.
160116
to watch our language
and stuff.
160117
ruffle people's feathers
they say.
160118
other level.
160119
good at holding my tongue...
160120
when someone disagrees
with me.
160121
160122
Getting all riled up...
160123
is how you act after
all's said and done.
160124
what I'm lacking.
160125
won't help anything.
160126
160127
with a short fuse
160128
to hear
160129
160130
trouble speaking kindly
or subtly.
160131
something super important
to say.
160132
takes the wheel.
160133
160134
but I don't care what
people think of me.
160135
or not they're picking up
what I'm putting down.
160136
you though
160137
is important
160138
best way possible—or at least
be nice about it.
160139
end up failing to convey
what I want to
160140
For sure.
160141
ole Yaoling. Thanks a bunch!
160142
makes someone hate me
then I'll be the bad guy.
160143
to think
160144
to me was...
160145
the dust settles.
160146
seriously considering the
person I was talking to.
160147
160148
end of it to finally realize
what I was doing.
160149
the blame game.
160150
giving up and running from
the conversation.
160151
about it seriously—and I mean
really seriously...
160152
lackadaisical I can be.
160153
fix a problem
it is doesn't matter.
160154
This has been a good
learning experience for me.
160155
to show me just how childish
I can be.
160156
opinions onto others...
160157
to understanding where
I'm coming from.
160158
just trying to make excuses
to cover up for myself.
160159
160160
all you care about is whether
or not you think it's fair.
160161
right or wrong isn't enough.
160162
Yukimi-san...
160163
pretty awkward...
160164
I've wiped the whole thing
from my brain box.
160165
160166
say that! And honestly
I really needed to hear it.
160167
Dragged you here
and there
160168
a valuable lesson.
160169
thinking this way.
160170
I've learned here
even if I wanted to.
160171
of my studies...
160172
of cringey moments ahead
of me—and failures
160173
myself up and backing off...
160174
embrace the embarrassment.
160175
what I've learned.
160176
160177
say that
160178
of messes going forward.
160179
looking forward to it
uh
160180
160181
160200
of my studies.
160201
for uni...
160202
check it to make sure
my Japanese is correct!
160203

170006
170007
Only four letters!
170008
170009
I was so terribly bored!
170010
Tell me a joke!
170011
170012

next time!
170014

The greater the difference in
temp between day and night
170018
the fruits!
170019
grow well in warm climates!
170020
warmer climates.
170021
temperatures produce
sourer fruit.
170022
grow well when cold!
170023
but their needs are different!
170024

deep and fascinating!

That's very kind of you.

170045
170046

170047

made to feel!
170049
170050

170051
Behold! The new Yui is here!
170052
A lady of class always remains
calm and collected.
170053

serene tranquility!
170054

170055
Plain and simple.
170056
I don't need a new name to
show you how I've changed!
170057
of the country life...
170058
170059
as convenient.
170060
which is something you don't
tend to see in the city.
170061
people dream of escaping
to the countryside.
170062
for school kids who don't
have a driver's license!
170063
you'd better be prepared

with me.
170099
170100
I am to hear that!
170101
170102
what I thought of you
170103
of you was...
170104
absent-minded?
170105
you don't talk much either.
170106
170107
I'm sorry about that.
170108

180004
I've come up with

Sorry

Probably because I did dance.

190004
feel free to say hi!

190009
with you sometime.
190010

190052
I can stay positive
190053
190054
you just started playing
bass recently
190055
playing together earlier
I was thinking...
190056
190057
190058
be on point with both
the rhythm and root notes.
190059
difficult instrument
190060
190061
my friend's bass
back in the day.
190062
pretty complex...
190063
every instrument just
takes practice.
190064
you've got some mad tambourine
skills
190065
time with my guitar if I wanna
keep up with you!
190066
190067
when you're playing bass?
190068
190069
rephrase my question.
190070
freestyled in our last
jam sesh together?
190071
that lick you played out
of my head.
190072
riffs like that myself too
190073
and it's not easy...
190074
going through your head
when you did that improv bit?
190075
190076
about me even during
your own solo then...
190077
the rhythm
190078
what you like made me
enjoy it even more?
190079
a big help!
190080
about your band...
190081
drums
190082
190083
or anything
190084
we talked about the songs
you play in your club
190085
that I wasn't sure how you
could play with that setup.
190086
how you go about it...
190087
190088
keyboard
four could manage with that.
190089
are getting added in post
you're using a synth keyboard?
190090
Thanks for humoring me.
190091
is so expensive!
190092
190093
my paycheck
pro recording equipment...
190094
with just a few mouse clicks.
190095
let you play music indoors
don't come cheap...
190096
on my next bank statement
is making me depressed...
190097
190098
like my account's in danger
of hitting zero or anything.
190099
account is in danger of hitting
zero or anything. It's just...
190100
I gotta pay to do what I love.
I'll pay it off soon enough.
190101
whining. I'll let you know
when my gear arrives!
190102
equipment I blew my
paycheck on?
190103
190104
190105
A new mic
an audio interface...
190106
software that all the pros
use. It was pretty pricey tbh!
190107
a synth keyboard
and some spare strings.
190108
I can't make some
great music now!
190109
190110
to my next song
190111
to take music seriously
from now on!
190112
right now
190113
everything now. I can't
wait to try it all out!
190114
equipment I ordered
showed up
190115
190116
hooked up to start
composing and recording.
190117
launch
detect the audio interface...
190118
I was getting endless
stupid errors.
190119
every single fix
got it done in the end.
190120
190121
190122
get to the song writing part!
190123
doing all of this for nothing.
190124
some new music.
190125
to hear them!
190126
Park a lot to practice singing
and playing at the same time.
190127
have started coming over
to listen to my songs.
190128
190129
cat from last time at the park
was one I see pretty often.
190130
a few pats to the ones
I recognize.
190131
started bouncing along
to the rhythm...
190132
190133
felt kinda weird
a good way.
190134
about it.
190135
190136
working on a guitar lick
or my backlog of housework
190137
will just pop into my head.
190138
190139
190140
Isn't it weird!?
190141
to me a lot.
190142
some random thought appears
and totally consumes my brain.
190143
a riff for a song on the keys
and suddenly thought of you.
190144
I sent you a text.
Sorry
190145
190146
song lyrics!
190147
190148
190149
190150
Especially since I struggled
a lot with the last one.
190151
190152
one of my worst classes.
190153
the lyrics
the melody writing on hold...
190154
done
and I can play you the song!
190155
Shibuya today
190156
company asked if I would
put out a song with them!
190157
190158
indie label
190159
indie label. No big break
for me yet.
190160
song
a video on her phone
190161
it to a video site
how the record label found me.
190162
the record company rep
said to me?
190163
190164

190165
190166
190167

190604
180152
180153
if you got drunk.
180154
200000
180155
imagine that!
180156
someone who's always
so calm let loose.
180157
you're old enough to drink.
180158
you are? Will I get to see
a new side of you?
180159
start bawling?
180160
drinking with you someday.
180161
first drink with me?
180162
180163
hurry up and become a
mature young man already.
180164

I've been worried about my

Do you have any kind

Not in particular.|I have a couple products.
Oh
Oh! That's kids these days
I'll do my best to get my skin

So
It got me going to a burger
Burgers are so expensive

Really? I had no idea.|Aww
Well
Do people still have pen pals?
Do you even know what
Emailing friends...?|Yeah
I guess it's all about social
 right?
How would you
But we're neighbors first and
 so here's to years
Know what a phone charm is?
People would attach a bunch
I found a ton of unopened ones
I used to be a serious collector.
But you don't really see them
 do you?
{NAME2}-chan
Put it on my phone case.|Attach it to something else.
Oh
 then.
Good idea. They're retro
I'm glad I came to you
Oh

I passed by an arcade and saw
I passed by an arcade and saw
They're so much bigger than
I couldn't help but feel

Oh
Oooh
I wonder if they still
Secret frames?|Codes?
Oh
You should go ask your mom

There's a huge sale at the
It's not the closest one

I dunno
Whaaat!? No
Being a housewife is all about
Ah
But it's not like you have all

The savings aren't that much.|Getting there costs money too.
I see. Yeah

Modern photo booths amaze me!
They even adjust the size
They're nothing like
Take any good pictures?|Use any good filters?
They came out perfect!
I look so young it's like I'm

 y'know?
Let's take some pics
 okay
Are your parents still on that
 {NAME2}-chan?
I'm alone for a while
Oh? So I was right.
It's great that they get along
 but it must be
 {NAME2}-chan.
My hubby left on a work trip
It's not for long
 you know?
Don't you ever get lonely
It's fun!|I'm fine
Yeah
Maybe I'll try reaching out
Might as well make the most
 right?
It's amazing that you're
It can't be easy
I'm just living my life.|You really think so?
My hubby's still out
 so...
I start slacking with
I barely put any effort into

It might have grown into
It was nothing
You're sooo mature! Are you

It feels like you're clearly
I'd always thought you

Things have come full circle.|History repeats itself.
That's exactly it! Children
Of course
Maybe it's the same endless
If that's the case
That's what it means to
Oh
 aren't I?

Going back over and reading
Is there any way to delete it?
 I hate how all this stuff

Can't beat a dog's loyalty.|I prefer cats.

You're kidding though...
We're talking about pets here!

You like your ramen

Cool. Good to know.
I like to keep up-to-date with

Apparently
They brought it to Europe as

It makes sense now. Thanks.
I told my mom about you
She was shocked.
Said it's been forever since I
Don't talk about school much?|What do you discuss?
When I was workin'
Normally
Right... I guess that
Feels like it's been forever
Lately
What did you tell her?|Because we're friends?
You know
Nothin' out of the ordinary.
Do moms really want to know
The other day
I'd like to visit.|Sounds fun.
My mom's on the night shift
My place is nothing special
Come by whenever.
What dish would you choose to
Cold noodles.|Ramen.
Good call. Can't go wrong
Kinda strange
And still have room
Ever tried rice?|Don't forget the dessert.
Yeah
Sure
They all go down smoothly.
I guess that's what
Remember what I told you

Turns out there are
Like with the Sahara Desert
Hula means "dance"
The "Erimo" in Cape Erimo
It's surprising how there's

I'm amazed by your knowledge.|How about "naan bread"?
It's fun to look this

Yeah
Lemme know if you

Hey
About the sauce?|That stuff on etymology?
Yeah
Yeah. I've been looking
A lot of words related to
It happens when foreign foods

It's interesting to see things
You sure like to study.|Does this help you cook?
I get excited thinking about
It's giving me too many ideas.
I should be able to cook up
I tried some ramen at this
The noodles and soup
But their roasted pork slices
The old man who ran
But I just can't
How does he do it?
I can't believe it.|Was it that good?
Yeah
Hey
 I'm always serious...
Wait.
Maybe it's about not
I need to try this out.
I'll throw the sugar in
The second time
That's how you get the
What are you talking about?|Random.
It's the roasted pork recipe
The uneven distribution
Talkin' to you made me realize
 all I had
You figured it out.|When're you making me some?
If I didn't talk it out with
 I'd still be struggling.
The roast pork?
I'll make the best bowl of
You know
Either they were hella brave
I wonder which.
I vote courage.|Hunger is the best spice.
Yeah
Lucky for the guy
People still ferment stuff.
 we're getting better
To think someone sealed away
It made a huge impact
That's exactly why fermented
 if you ask me.
I knew that you'd understand.
I tried making my own homemade
If I'm happy with them
Damn it...
Those bamboo shoots I made
They didn't work out?|Hey
Nah.
They're perfect.
Turned out better than I ever
Issue is
I don't know how she did it.
Time to experiment.|The wonders of fermentation.
Yeah. I'll nail this taste
 all right.
Right... I guess I'll start by
I'll get back to you when
Met Pops the other day.
I had him try the best bowl
How did it go?|What did he say?
He praised me like
And when he was done...
He told me...
What matters is
what comes next.
What does that mean?|You have a ways to go?
The best bowl is just
I guess
I don't know yet what
But I know that talking to you
If you don't mind
Leave it to me
Heh
I've been thinking about
Sure.|Tell me.
Imagine two bowls of ramen
 one's not.
Pops says the latter is
Why's that?|Sounds wise.
If I want my customers to be
They must be the ones
Yeah
I've gotta let them decide
Or at least
I've never owned my own store
I feel more confident talking
I'm just listening.|Got your thoughts sorted?
Yeah
Hey
There's something bothering
 I guess...
I'm all ears.|What's up?
There are so many flavors and
But that might not be what
If that's that case
What's the point of searching
Shouldn't I just make what
That's what I'm wondering.
Don't forget your goal.|What do you want to do?
My goal... Yeah
I lost myself for a bit.
I want to create the best
Huh? What was I
You're a lifesaver. I mean it.
 man.
Spoke to a guy from class...
He laughed and said I was
Surprisingly? What did he
Contrary to expectations.|Well
Hey! No one asked for
Huh
I've never been all that great
That's why he was

It's fun talking with you.|Maybe you've changed.
Yeah... Glad to hear that
If I have
Anyway
Hey
I'm off to try somethin' new
No problem.|Lemme get back to you.
Cool. Let's get going then.
Gotcha. Maybe some other time.
Okay
Hey
Can I use your kitchen?
Uh
Hang on. I'd better explain
I can fill you in more at my

I usually feel super groggy
So I need a cup of tea

You don't see any sweetened

I dunno...|Sounds interesting.
Mint tea is lovely in the

Wasn't sure what they meant
But it basically means
It's been getting real popular
I'm kind of curious now.|Does authentic mean spicy?
That's the spirit

The ingredients and seasonings
Not everything is spicy
Though I am a Sichuan girl.
I'll see if I can find any
Consider it my way of saying
I realized something super
I need to try raw egg
There are all sorts of egg
But I would have never even
What about you
I guess?|Like it's my job.
Oh-ho! I thought so.
So... it's that tasty
The eggs they sell in this
When in Japan

I know Chinese and
But man

What sorta bath salts
 Sensei?
Colorful ones.|Only the best quality.
Ooh
 fragrant bath

Speaking of which
Ones that make your

 etc.
If it's all true

Heck
I'll buy a whole bunch
Walking around the city
Japan sure loves its vending
 doesn't it?
In places with convenience
I don't see much of a point
They're even more convenient!|They're easy to use.
Hmm... Is that it?
Japanese people have a

But maybe people just want to
That's deep.|You think so?
Uh
Oh
Guess I said something
 huh.
Did you know some Japanese

It's a little confusing
Like what?|Lay a good one on me.
Let's see. Well
It's a pretty interesting
 don't you think?
It made me wonder whether that
If so
Totally relatable
I see.|Same here.
Who knows
Although you gotta agree
I use my computer to keep
I always struggle to come up
I'm making the most of my time
 but sometimes
That counts as studying!|There's more important things.
Yeah
Right... yeah. There is
And that's what kind of person
It would've been better if I'd
 sure.
But as they say
I feel better after talking
 Sensei.
Now I can face my Mama
 and tell her
Papa was the one who insisted
but I haven't talked to him
I appreciate the space
Maybe he's taking a back seat?|He respects your independence?
Don't tell me that he's
Aww geez
In other words
Aww geez... Somehow that

At any rate
I'm the one who'll be

Welp
In one of my lectures
There was even a Chinese
Pretty amazing
Around the same time

Not exactly next door
 when you
That's why I can't help but
I'd love to go check out
That'd be quite the trip.|Both would be no mean feat.
Oh yeah
Then it's a whole other flight
You'd have to catch a flight
 right?
So doing it all in one trip
I thought about it
They have Chinatowns not only
 but Kobe and
 too.
I'd love to check them out
No doubt.|Totally.
I've heard of people from my

For sure. I'm still trying to
I figured maybe they could
Not sure. There's so much
Including what others saw in
Adults are always telling us
Don't say things that could

Japan takes that to a whole
If I'm being honest
I can't help but bite back
Anyone would feel the same.|It's a matter of restraint.
You're the same
What's most important
You're right. I'm sure that's
Just venting your feelings
I kind of get it now.
I'm not the only one out there
 huh?
Gotta say
 Sensei. Thanks!
Backtracking a bit...
I'm well aware that I have
Especially when I have
My impulse to speak my mind
That's okay for now.|Focus on conveying your thoughts.
Not only do I talk straight
I only worry about whether
I don't have that problem with

The way you say something
 of course.
I wish I could say things the

Yep
That's one worry down for

That's how I used

The only thing that mattered

In other words
Where's this coming from?|That's pretty heavy.
It took being on the receiving

Geez
Look at me
It won't get them any closer
Denying it was my fault. I was
One step closer to adulthood.|Empathy is important.
Right. You can't grow up if
Exactly. Focusing on what's
This whole thing with
I feel like I made things
but I'm happy to say
Glad to hear it.|As long as you learn from it.
Ha ha

I got mad and sad.
 Sensei...
Yeah
I never thought I'd end up
I couldn't forget what

I'm still in the middle
So I imagine I've got plenty
 to boot.
But instead of beating
I'd rather forge on ahead and
That way
Sounds good to me!|Just take it slow
It's reassuring to hear you
 Sensei!
I might make my fair share
I guess it's weird to say I'm
 but
 I actually kind of am!
That's random.|What're you talking about?
Do you see yourself in them?|Do you want to live here?
I'm still in the middle
I have to write this report
...and I'd like you to
I'm at the diner right now

Summer?|Winter?
Nope! It's Fall.
Better luck next time!
Thanks for replying though!
I'm bored out of my mind.
I need time to prepare.|I'm bad with jokes.

Could it be...
I'm the only one who struggles
I have made a full recovery!
I'm going to make up for

You won't have to worry
There's no turning back!
Oh yeah!
Behold! The new Yui

I'll just stick with Yui.
Just watch me!
I do wonder what you think
I admire it.|How's it differ to the city?

If you miss the hourly bus
Then there's all the bugs...
You'll likely meet more
There's more where that came
Musubi's told me so many
Where do you usually
Not virtually
Near my house.|In Shibuya.
Ah
I'm the same!
Oooh
I've heard there are tons
That reminds me.

I bought them forever ago.
No wonder they're
They're no use to me anymore.
So many things to buy...
'Cause I need a new vacuum
Do you have any shops
Try Akihabara.|Just get 'em online.
I see!
I heard that there are a lot
That's all real world
 so I'll ask
Great idea!
I don't have to go out
Hey
Let's go shopping
I'm super curious to learn
I've been wondering...
When we first met
That you were interesting.|Wow
That's it?
You didn't think I was
If not
I'm a bit worried...
That you might be forcing
I like spending time with you.|I like you the way you are.
You have no idea how happy
Well
It's only fair if I tell you
 too!
My first impression
That you seem pretty...
You're not very excitable
Cause you do all the talking.|You're the energetic one.
Oh
But my impression of you
You may be the quiet type
You're thoughtful
You also have a great
Perhaps I'm complimenting you

 I have to ask...
Do you eat yours with salt?
Yup.|I don't.

Things got tense between us.
I had no idea that there were
