Pardon me
Bless her heart
Well
Now
Y'all ever heard of a shadow named Alice? That poor young girl's always by her lonesome. Seems to me she could sure use a friend. Reckon you know anyone who could keep her company?
I heard them Mandrakes can be used to whip up some sorta cure-all potion. Trouble is
That Ame-no-Uzume's got moves that'd make the angels jealous. But I can't help but wonder if she ever gets tired of always dancing by her lonesome. Got any friends who'd be up for joining her?
Well
That old rubber ball made the Treasure Demon happier than a dog with two tails! But who'd've known that secret entrance led to a baseball stadium!? I must confess
There's a whole stash of rare stuff sittin' in that stadium! But I can't get even a hair closer to any of it with that aggressive pitching machine standin' guard. If you know a batter good enough to hit them balls outta the park
Would ya look at that. Another secret entrance! That Treasure Demon
That Treasure Demon was happier than a rooster in a henhouse when I showed it that Movie Ticket Stub! Turns out that secret entrance leads to an old Japanese castle of sorts
My stars
Well
Land sakes
I've been mullin' over the idea of startin' a new store 'round here... But that Jack Frost's got the roads slipperier than a snake in a bucket of oil. If you know anyone who's got a knack for skatin'
Well
I've got a delivery that's hotter than a skillet on a summer day! Problem is
Y'all won't believe this—I found a spot loaded with rare items! But
Urgh... lately
Well
This new order's some kinda heavy steel gizmo... looks like it might be a weapon? My shop ain't exactly set up for this sorta thing
I've been tryin' to get some new trade routes up and runnin'
Well
That ol' bandit Shadow leader just don't know when to quit. He's got himself a bunch of strong bodyguards taggin' along. Things're about to get a li'l dicey 'round here. Sorry to trouble ya again
Oof... Today's delivery is heavier than a mule in the mud! Just how am I expected to drag around something like this all by myself? I betcha this would be a breeze if I had the wind at my back! Any of your friends know how to whip up a gust or two?
I've been thinkin' of openin' a new trade route for my li'l shop. Trouble is
Well
Well
Got me a delivery of frozen goods
I've got my eye on a new trade route for business
Aw
Shoot
I've been thinkin' of sprucin' up my shop lineup with some quirky goodies! How weird
Marthym's Shop is expandin' again with a brand-new trade route! It's excitin'
Uh-oh
Not this nonsense again! That bandit Shadow leader's back
I've been hearin' folks talk 'bout these things called Attributes lately... Fire
Had some business talks go south on me the other day. Think you might know anyone who could help me polish up my diplomacy skills?
Thank ya kindly for your advice on negotiatin' the other day—it's gonna help me keep my customers smilin'! But I reckon I need to work on my strength
Turns out there's a whole lot more to them Attributes than I thought—Psychokinesis
I'd like to say a big thank-you for always coming 'round and supportin' my business. I've been rackin' my brain tryin' to figure out how to return the favor
I can't thank ya enough for all the things you've taught me. I feel like I've grown a whole lot as a small business owner. Now I'm ready to put my skills to the real test. I'm talkin' knowledge
I stumbled on somethin' odd by the roadside the other day. Looked like a little piece of desire
I got a little favor to ask... Well

I've made up my mind—I'm takin' a trip to learn some new tools of the trade. But I hear it's more dangerous than a hog in a smokehouse out there! If you could lemme borrow a few of your friends
I came across somethin' real curious—it's a rock! But not just any rock
I hear humans are wild for them "bargain sales." Oh
Now that I'm expandin' my business
Mementos is lookin' rougher than a tumbleweed in a tornado these days. All these odd desires are stirrin' the Shadows into a frenzy and it's makin' life hard for a small business owner like me. I could definitely benefit from some hired muscle. Could any of your friends shield me from danger?
Oh dearie. My poor little shoulders've been feelin' stiff as a fence post lately. But I can't just up and leave the shop unattended
Well
Do I have some news for you
Y'all ain't gonna believe this

I got somethin' big brewin'—a job that could roll in more dough than a pastry chef on fire! But I gotta keep it cheap to make it worth it. Got any sharp negotiators in your crew?

That pesky Incubus done called in his buddies... He's lookin' mighty hard—uh
I got somethin' big brewin'—a job that could roll in more dough than a pastry chef on fire! But I gotta keep it cheap to make it worth it. Got any sharp negotiators in your crew?

Dang it! I think I ticked off a succubus. She's been glarin' at me like I stole her last biscuit. I was just tryin' to expand my business! Maybe I accidentally stepped into her turf... Anyhoo

That darn Succubus is still givin' me the stink eye. I reckon she's just bidin' her time to make her move. You got any friends who are good at weakening enemies? Preferably tougher than the ones from before? Then we could give her a taste of her own medicine...

 darlin'
 that Leanan Sidhe ain't got a soul to confide in. You reckon there's a cheerful gentleman out there who'd be willin' to talk with her? They'd best be resilient enough to resist her temptations... or to thick to even notice.
 I'll be! That high-and-mighty Neko Shogun's gone and made off with my merchandise and refuses to return it! Maybe a fellow feline could sweet-talk 'em into doin' the right thing. Know any cats with a silver tongue?
 I don't mean to fuss
Riddle
 every time I try to get near one
Phoebe
 bless my stars! There's a Treasure Demon guardin' a secret entrance. What do ya reckon's hidin' in there? Bet it's somethin' shiny and worth a fortune! I bet we could get them to move if we throw 'em somethin' soft and round... if you catch my drift.
 I don't really know anythin' about sports... Could any of your friends show me around?
 we might just be able to grab the goods. I'll give ya a fair slice of the spoils!
 though
 but lemme tell ya
 have you ever seen a castle this big? I thought castles were supposed to be old
 sugar
 that Shadow Bessa is drivin' me up the wall... Keeps harpin' on about findin' guests for their show's opening ceremony. I'd be much obliged if you could round up your friends with pizzazz and sparkle
 send 'em my way
 bless my heart
 it's gotta stay that way. You know anyone who could help me keep it nice 'n' warm?
 wouldn't ya figure
 some downright frightenin' Shadows have been swipin' my goods from right under me! I'm at my wit's end now with these bandits. Say
 shoot... the ringleader of them bandit Shadows came struttin' over and threatened to clean me out for good next time. I don't know how much more my little shop can take. I'm gonna need some friends of yours to work security for me in case he comes back.
 but as a pro
 but them Shadows done blocked the way. It's a real pain for business
 ain't that just my luck. Them bandit Shadows are back
 but I sure could use your help.
Lv. 20 Cattle
 it's riddled with thorns and that ain't safe. Well
 ain't this somethin'... Them bandit Shadows are back
 here we go again... That bandit Shadow boss done showed up
 but I reckon the customer won't be too happy if it's all melted by the time I show up. Any chance you know someone who can help keep it cool?
 but the area's full of aggressive Shadows that keep ambushin' folks. You reckon you know anybody who's good at defense? Perhaps they could lend me a hand?
 heck... Them bandit Shadows are back at it. You know the ones I mean. And I swear
 that leader of them bandit Shadows is back again! Persistent fella
 you ask? Well
 sure
 this ain't good... Them bandit Shadows are back
 and he's got a whole crew of armored guards tougher than a cast-iron skillet. I'm beggin' ya sugar—you gotta save me!

 talkin' deals
 or maybe a fragment of someone's consciousness—I can't say for sure. But it felt like it might be connected to one of your friends. I'll let ya know where it was

 business ain't been too hot lately... But I heard folks'll buy just 'bout anything if there's a cute mascot peddlin' it. You reckon people are really that easy to win over? Could you be a dear and find me a cute mascot before I have to file for bankruptcy?

 I've got this rock that can store electricity. Only problem is
