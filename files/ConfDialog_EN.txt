don't know its meaning.
3809040
don't think we can get past the fence...
3809041
Let us think of a solution.
3809042
3809045
So if we keep an eye on that...
3809047
should activate the mechanism.
3809048
We should check it out.
3809050
3809051
3809100
3809105
tighter as we go
3809105a
It means we're getting closer to the treasure.
3809106
power source somewhere...
3809106a
out. Let's look around here first.
3809107
3809110
3809111
Why put them around an empty space?
3809112
near here. Let's look for it.
3809115
take out the power. We'll have to find more.
3809120
another way to get up there?
3809122
3809125
It's a... raised thumb gesture?
3809126
with the same symbol on it.
3809126a
pushing that light for me?
3809127
and the matching light in order!
3809127a
3809127b
3809127c
playing
3809127d
pitcher's mound when they need to strategize?
3809127e
do this pose.
3809127f
3809127g
3809127h
3809127i
all over it! I'll never forgive him
3809127k
3809130
There's a strange mark on the door
3809132
3809133
3809134
Let's take a closer look.
3809135
we can enter now.
3809140
glowing red!
3809140a
But what on earth was that just now?
3809140b
glove-looking thing came out and...
3809140c
3809140d
You tag a runner while holding the ball
and they're out?
3809140e
expression of Kiuchi's attachment to baseball?
3809140f
while avoiding the glowing red spots.
3809141
Wonder!
3809145
as always.
3809146
Let's try pushing it.
3809150
3809151
open. Is that odd symbol the key?
3809153
3809154
previous hall via the air vents.
3809160
We'll have 'em all out soon.
3809161
investigate there too?
3809165
this door in that passage earlier.
3809167
3809170
somewhere nearby.
3809172
Maybe a pink or purple one?
3809173
this ball. Let's go back and try it out.
3809175
inner door.
3809177
This one may have a <color=#FF423F>time limit</color> on it.
3809178
3809179
intruders that Kiuchi-sama warned us about!?
3809180
this
3809185
3809190
3809195
3809200
should be down. Let's go check.
3809210
than the others... Keep your wits about you
Wonder!
3809211
3809220
floor could be a trap...
3809223
3809230
breath so far. A break is in order.
3809233
guarding something valuable
3809234
3809236
3809237
pretty gross
3809238
treasure. Let's stay focused!
3809239
we've got to steal them away!
3809240
control panels and then...
3809241
Kiuchi-sama's exhibition match will
soon begin!
3809242
sounds like Kiuchi is at center field.
3809245
3809246
the highest rank.
3809247
this palace
3809248
are some areas we haven't explored yet.
3809249
could go there first. It's up to Wonder.

3820002
3820003
Let's search the area
3820004
something...
3820007
3820008
still need to do
3820009
3820010
that gate...
3820011
unlocked it
3820012
3820013
3820014
3820015
3820016
I wonder where we could find some...
3820017
to do right now?
3820018
treasure chest before we open it.
3820019
Perhaps you could use your skills of
perception to uncover a hint.
3820101
3820102
with that camera...?
3820103
3820104
different.
3820105
3820106
this torch...
3820107
3820108
3820109
about this.
3820110
3820111
shinobi challenged the great
Castle Miyazawa.
3820112
3820113
them! Few will return alive!
3820114
conquer the castle and reclaim their honor?
3820114b
starring Hiromu Miyazawa
3820115
3820116
Castle Miyazawa is...
3820117
forms
3820117b
He did say something about a script...
3820117c
follow his script to go through the palace!?
3820117d
is a movie... The <color=#FF423F>cameras</color> may be key.
3820118
Shall we investigate the area first?
3820119
the way.
3820120
by the camera.
3820121
just for decoration...
3820122
still proclaiming their own truth...
3820123
the Impregnable Automata Fortress!
3820124
Uh
3820125
3820126
and observation to escape? Or are they stupid?
3820126b
I'm not falling for it.
3820127
do we actually do now?
3820129
part myself.
3820129b
should at least take a closer look.
3820130
I guess it changed shape
3820130b
transforming yourself
3820131
ain't he?
3820132
somethin'?
3820133
It looks different from the others.
3820134
were faced with a second trial!
3820135
had any hope of overcoming this automata...
3820135b
shall weep! For they are powerless!
3820136
it still pisses me off!
3820137
has anything to do with that camera?
3820139
to film and cameras.
3820139b
but we can go ahead and test some theories.
3820140
3820140b
a ninja technique?
3820141
crap is just a way to stretch his
shoddy premise...
3820142
3820143
3820144
only to find themselves facing a new trial...
3820145
3820146
this be the end for our little miscreants!?
3820147
have to do with cameras again.
3820149
Good luck
3820150
pointing a camera at it?
3820150b
I think I'm losing the plot now
3820151
to think about it too much.
3820152
Man
3820154
are we supposed to apply a camera here?
3820155
it into the heart of my fortress...
3820156
However! You will go no further!
3820157
demonic art of the <color=#FF423F>Cursed Eye of Time</color>!
3820158
art" this time?
3820159
techniques" thing wasn't gonna cut it this time?
3820160
we're not here to workshop Miyazawa's script.
3820160b
Cursed Eye of Time really is.
3820160c
out the camera.
3820161
really do anything...
3820161b
us to another dimension?
3820161c
you know...
3820162
3820163
huh.
3820164
Maybe those lantern things do something?
3820165
to learn their lesson and kept going...
3820166
lanterns in the <color=#FF423F>proper order</color>... However!
3820166b
pattern! Struggle and despair! Ahahaha!
3820167
3820167b
this time.
3820169
his automata are not...
3820169b
find some hint about the pattern we need.
3820170
impossible
3820171
3820172
easily? My whole script is ruined now!
3820173
The story's not over yet!
3820174
3820175
change what we've gotta do
3820175c
sure was a cliché villain quip
3820175d
actor on top of a garbage script... What a
hack job.
3820176
3820200
3820202
looks of it.
3820204
crucial that we grasp its layout. Be sure
to check the map as we proceed.
3820300
3820302
Hey
the Third Bailey!
3820304

moving!
3820400
3820402
labyrinthine...
3820404
3820500
3820502
passageways!? And it looks like there's
obstacles round every corner...!
3820504
that we are getting closer to the Treasure.
We have made good progress.
3820600
within our grasp.
3820602
be a real pain to get through. Looks like
there's even more obstacles...
3820604
of the castle
stretch. Let's do this!
3880001
face a trial.
3880002
3881001
3881002

3881005

3881021

3881022
steal these Shadows' powers?
3881023
They may be quite useful if we're smart
with them.
3881024
3881025
3881026
prevent us from stealing more of their power.
3881027
the vassal Shadows...
3881028
3881029
we're prepared to face <color=#FF423F>his lordship</color>.

but I have something to report.
3890080

3890081
Persona has only just awakened
3900034
promised. Then I would like to speak in more
detail about the job I have for you.
3900035
attendance at school is drawing closer
3900036
would be remiss to inhibit your desire
to learn...
3900037
school during your midday comestible period.
3890067
3800475
afternoon meal break. Do humans no longer
use that word...?
3800476
now. Let's do our best to understand each
other better.
3900040
the comestible hour
3900041
Furthermore
within you.
3800477

instead.
3800478
3900044
leaves much to be desired.
3900045
nurturing hope
splash of color...
3900046
there is someone I must keep a close watch on.
Let us meet again at school.
3900065
3890083
3890084
and everything.
3900067
3900068
Our families would get together and have
dinner every now and then.
3900070
up since the last time I saw you. I've seen
your mom a few times here and there.

from the Block." You can call me any time
you need something!
3800482

3890085
3890086
That collar and all the pockets give
it away.
3890087

3890002
high school...
3890003
there first thing
cheer him on!
3890005
Shibuya! For that one I think I took... Was it
the Inogami Line to Shimo-Kitazawa?
3900077
breakfast started. See you later
3901001
3901002
Two to form one anew... Two to form one...
3901003
3901004
3900080
3900081
3900083
I think it's him!
3700810
3900085
3900086

3900088

3900097
3900098
I don't know what I would've done

3900099

3800533
3890088

3900105
you try to answer this question for me.
3900107
can impact others negatively compares a

3890007
3890008
to various kinds of produce.

apples who've fallen from the wagon...

think. I'm sure even Menaces had extenuating
circumstances that led them astray.
3900119
textbooks to where we left off last week.
3900120
3900121
Definitely the work of a Menace.
3900123
wasn't it?
3890092
something you could easily miss...
3890093
living on the wild side...
3900125

3900126

she stopped playing.
3900157
baseball together
quitting the team.
3900165
lately
which is a big relief.
3900166
she sits near you in class!
3900168
more confident in yourself! You did save
my skin this morning after all.
3900169
can do is try and be there for her...
3800548
3800549
Where do you usually eat?
3900159
for the stairs.
3900160
dining experience?
3900162
that too.
3900163
See you later!
3900172
3900173
as promised.
3900174
and Shadows...
3890017
Are you ready?
3900175
you visited is called "Mementos."
3900176

3890019

3800560

3900178
thoughts and feelings people hold toward
their world.
3900179
A place that light itself cannot reach.
3890099

their world.
3890100
3890101

3900186

3900187

3800572
a Persona.
3800573
lies inside their heart.
3800574
corrupted
3800575
willing to hurt others with reckless abandon.
3800576
the real world is the central cause of the
problem we are facing now.
3800577
a means to exploit the desires of others.
And I am intent on catching them.
3800579
accept so easily
for yourself.
3800580
those people who've lost all desire.
3800581
Shadow goes out of control...
3800582
Shadows around them.
3800583
of those Shadows...
3800653
seen across the real world.
3800655
eludes me. Therefore
importance we learn more about it.
3800656
I would like to move on to discussing the
job I have for you.
3890102
so to speak.
3890103
your abilities.
3900189
<color=#FF423F>Phantom Thief</color>.
3798835
you can already guess.
3890104
to experience the full range of your newly
awakened Persona's abilities as well.
3890106
comes knocking. Though I can understand
your hesitation.
3890107
3890108
fading desire talking.
3900193
3798836
further once I've introduced our target.
3900194
after school.
3900195
from you
3900196
See you soon.
3989911
3890073
my takeoff!
3900074
3900210
thought I wasn't looking where I was going.
3900211
3900213
it wasn't scratched or anything
3900214
3900215
shall we?
3900216
didn't want his phone to break
3900217
lineup even now.
3900218
3900223
3900225
3900226
through the hallway yesterday
3900227
about you. No
in my head...
3900219
3900202
3900220

action. Simply claiming it was an "accident"
is enough for them to drop the issue.
3890117
3890118
3890120
3890121
3890122

together to reach a solution.
3890139

We are in crisis.
3890141
3890142
and steal a certain precious item from it
thereby becoming Phantom Thieves.
3890144
But before we get into that...
3890145

3890152

a job that will put your life at risk.
3890153
3890154

continue to lose hope every day.

3900415

3895758
Food Fight and falling into Miyazawa's trap.
3895759
barrier will probably change too.
3895760
Wonder.
3895761
I wonder what kind of desire twisted
Miyazawa's heart like this.
3895762
wouldn't mind putting me down anytime soon?
3895763
3895764
Let's pause here for now.
3895765
or keep exploring.
3895790
some rest.

3895802
that. So the results determine whether an
action was right or wrong
3895803
as a routine work check-in.
3895804
you think.
3895805
I look forward to learning more while I'm
by your side.
3895808
Metaverse growing stronger. If only we could
attain a power boost like that...
3895809
little league days.
3895810
3895811
3895812
for hope coming from...
3895813
3895850
you on my master's behalf.
3895851
you have successfully identified the
next offender.

3895892
Kano-kun's here today.
3895893
easy to find him during lunch.
3895895
3895896
3895897

Kano right away is paramount?
3895898
3895899
said Kano-kun's not in the classroom.
3895900
Any idea where he might be?
3895902
3895903
before? We should go check there then.
3895904
speak with you for a moment?
3895905
about to...
3895906
3895907
{NAME2}?
3895908
too long.
3895909
3895910
3895940
up here too?
3895941
Well
3895943
Food Fight?
3895944
Miyazawa has some trick up his sleeve.
3895945
3895946

this. I know it's a setup.

3895981
they left it out of the TV broadcast.
3895982
the cops called on me. Good thing they left
it out of the TV broadcast.
3895983
Miyazawa's punching bag. With all his bad
reviews circulating...
3895984
over. Pops has never been in good health
all of this... pushed him over the edge.
3895985
been struggling financially and the customers
have stopped comin'.
3895986
3895987
He filled the soup we poured our hearts into
with cheap
3895988
my fault.
3895990
was actually one of Miyazawa's conditions
for agreeing to stop the bad reviews.
3895991

3896062
at Victory Kitchen for our battle today!
3896063
I'll be waiting!
3896064
the next few days
looking forward to it! And remember...
3896065
taste cleaner than any sword!
3896066
Have a great lunch!
3896090
show me this.
3896091
looked like Kano-kun
I knew anything.
3896092
outside Victory Kitchen.
3896093
of you.
3896094
gonna be this afternoon... So really any
minute now.
3896095
ran off in such a hurry before.
3896096
it go!?
3896098
to Kano-kun.
3896099
trying to tear it apart... I understand why
he's so angry.
3896100
going to the Food Fight...
3896101
path by his own will.
3896102
Miyazawa's intent to crush Kano is real.
3896103
I'm worried about Kano-kun losing...
3896104
than that...
3896106
was revolting!
3896107
3896108
Victory Kitchen
3896109
is just fantastic! Thank yooouuu!
3896110
officially a condemned Menace!
3896111
punk who doesn't know the first thing about
good flavor! Wahahahahaha!
3896112
3896113
3700742
he's dead...
3896114
3896115
huh? Thanks to a certain brat always causing
him trouble...
3896116
child like you literally stopped his heart.
Heheh... Gahahaha!
3896118
3896120
of vision?
3896121
3896122
{NAME2} has been having strange fits
like this ever since I met him.
3896123
premonition that could help us find a
solution to this
3896126
3896127
3896128
convince Kano-kun to back out of the fight!
3896129
3896130
I'm really worried about Shun...
3896131
I have no way to help him...
3896132
I just feel so exhausted.
3896133
even remember signing it... But he has it now
so I guess there's nothin' I can do...
3896134
in the hospital...!
3896135
just nothin' else I can do about it...
3896137
3896138
guess he's not one to back down after
gettin' called out like that.
3896139
Damn it! I wanna help him
3896141
3896142
all away...
3896143
3896144
3896145
put it in the safe at Victory Kitchen.
3896146
it to remember her by. I planned to give it
to Shun once he completed his training.
3896147
you two give it to Shun for me?
3896149
good friends...
3711591
there's an item in the safe at Victory
Kitchen we can use to help Kano?
3711592
3896150
gonna go. Put simply...
3896151
criticize it.
3896152
Victory Ramen!"
3896153
think the more fiery reaction is better
don't you?
3896154
take part in this!
3896155
to refuse?
3896156
you? I am the legal owner of this shop.
3896157
replace it with someone more compliant.
3896158
3896159
leave in the middle of the day to come here!
3896160
worry
3896161
3896162
3896163
whose lies and bullshit ruined
Victory Kitchen!
3896164
3896165
setting you up to lose!
3896166
3896167
Miyazawa a taste of the real Victory
Kitchen!
3896168
3896169
Yamagoshi-san with your doe-eyed delusions
about "the soul of Victory Kitchen."
3896170
would you mind getting out?
3896171
3896172
his food during the fight. Go on
3896173
there's no way I can help you.
3896174

3896230
Today's Food Fight challenger has arrived!
3896231
getting ready as we speak!
3896232
there before the fight?
3896233
3896234
like something out of a manga...
3896256
3896257
Just when I need it most!
3896235

emergency stop.
3896239
is safe.
3896240
3896241
work this time?
3896242
we'll never make it in time!
3896243
risky move.
3896245
passengers are too distracted to notice us.
3896246
Metaverse Navigator. But just be
careful that—
3896247
3896248

3896250
3896251
3896252
Cattle!?

3896282
the train this time.
3896283
Metaverse from Shibuya Station.
3896284
Mementos from the entrance.
3896285
anywhere else
in Mementos we might end up.
3896286
the middle of a swarm of Shadows like we were
just now... right?
3896287
move I prefer to avoid where possible.
3896288
first time
a good spot.
3896289
entrance
3896291
important
3896292
is nearby. Let's exit Mementos from here.
3896293
on foot.
3896294
for Shinjuku. Let's hurry.
3896330
Lufel said!
3896331
The emergency stop probably affected other
trains too.
3896332
ourselves in advance of any trouble we
might face.
3896333
3896360
3896362
running normally!
3896363
3896364
Just try your best to hurry!

Food Fight works.
3896401
limit
3896402
3896404
signature shoyu ramen. Are you ready?
3896405
3896406
To capture Victory Kitchen's signature taste
I have to shave the bonito flakes...
3896407
3896408
3896409
old cheese grater things?
3896410
them here anymore.
3896411
3896412
3896413
3896414
know what? There is one shaver box I left
out for display.
3896415
usable. But if you wanted to try... now that'd
make for some pretty good footage.
3896416
3896417
treasured that thing with their lives!
3896418
let pride get in the way of doing your job?
3896419
some authentic broth or not?
3896420
bonito flakes! Ahahahahaha!
3896421
a shaver box...
3896422
then... Entering this fight was pointless in
the first place!
3896423
3896424
3896426
win
3896427
3896429
3896430
smiling whenever he opened it...
3896431
3896432
something important to Yamagoshi-san.
3896433
something out of there with a big grin
on his face.
3896435
3896436
middle of shooting!
3896437
3896438
broth yet
3896439
3896440
3896441
3896450
3896451
for me...
3896452
old thing...
3896453
3896454
3896455
3896470
flakes to do?
3896471
ingredients. It all boils down to skill.
Don't you know that?
3896472
You really are beyond help
3896473
3896474
3896475
3896476
3896477
tasting!
3896478
authentic flavor of Victory Kitchen. If I
deem that he has truly succeeded...
3896479
3896480
3896481
3896482
3896483
3896484
3896485
3896487
3896488
right! I always say that at restaurants!
3896489
3896490
take two
3896491
through! Even with the proper tools
there's just a lack of talent here!
3896492
waste! In the end
playing pretend.
3896493
3896494
heard you! You said
3896495
harder to edit!
3896496
3896497
Victory Kitchen. The flavor Shun wanted
to protect... Pops's flavor!
3896498
3896499
what? You're all fired! The whole staff!
3896500
3896501
3896502
sided with you!
3896503
oppose my verdict
sad sacks wouldn't have to be canned.
3896504
end of the stick. It's sad really!
3896505
3896506

me? G-Go ahead. You'll be the next violent
punk to go viral!
3896508
manager
3896509
assault! Have them take away his little friends
too while they're at it!
3896510
3896511
interfered! Um... That's right
a serious obstruction of business!
3896512
you think the cops are going to believe?
3896513
3896514
drag children into this!
3896515
the authorities on us. We need to get Kano
and escape at once!
3896516
3896517
3896519
anymore. I'll stay and take full
responsibility for this.
3896520
Thanks for everything.
3896521
3896522
have a change of heart
behind all of his wrongdoing?
3896523
I would've already...
3896524
3896525
I knew I sensed potential for hope in you.
3896526
3896527
3896528
should get away from here ASAP
3896529
Metaverse?
3896530
least get to the station...
3896531
3896532
Katayama-san... I made them worry about
me again...
3896533
3896550
Kano-kun!
3896551
3896552
3896554
didn't use the Metaverse Navigator!
3896555
3896556
3896558
3896559
3896560
3896561
3896562
3896563
you talking like that?
3896564
clothes it turns into a "who's the most
confounded" contest...
3896565
thing!?
3896566
3896567
you know this form represents the pinnacle
of panache and refinement!
3896568
3896569
noodle-filled skull!
3896570
3896571
suddenly end up here?
3896573
3896574
worse
inside of Miyazawa's Palace.
3896575
Navigator?
3896576
3896578
3896579
3896580
3896581
Kano's safety. I suggest we get out of the
Palace as soon as possible.
3896582
to run
not ideal.
3896583
3896584
on here?
3896586
3896589
before.
3896590
Kano took place in reality
has changed to reflect that.
3896591
3896592
for an alternative exit.
3896620
3896621
3896666
3896631
his enemies.
3896622
3896623
as that may seem.
3896624
3896625
glittering stars in the heavens.
3896664
3896626
3896627
3896628
3896629
3896630
3896632
3896633
dared defile my sacred studio.
3896634
3896635
incoming Shadows to notice the trap in time!
3896636
of here!
3896637
thread. A trifling hack and slash isn't
going to cut it.
3896638
3896639
missed our little Shun-kun.
3896640
3896641
weird outfit...?
3896642
manifestation of Miyazawa's desire!
3896643
3896645
insurgents escape? I said kill them.
3896646
3896647
3896648
death. For the crime of obstruction
shall all face execution.
3896649
talkin' about!?
3896650
Metaverse... He has free reign to do whatever
he wants. That includes destroying us!
3896651
anything I want here! This studio was
designed by me
3896652
Once again
ended up worse.
3896653
3896654
tantrum
apart to the brink of collapse.
3896655
and Masa-kun down with you.
3896656
3896658
No talking on set!
3896659
also in my hands
at the breaking point!
3896660
for everyone around you! Isn't that right
Shun-kun!?
3896661
3896662
was all part of your plan!
3896663
the leading role's lines!
3700367
3700607
3700741
in set etiquette. Hehehehe...
3896667
3896668
me. Just please leave them alone!
3896669
3896670
3896671
this net in the way!
3896672
because I went against Miyazawa...!
3896674
3896675
doesn't deserve anyone's kindness!
3896676
to tear down everyone around you. Isn't that
how it always goes?
3896677
3896678
and your ridiculous pride over a cheap bowl
of noodles.
3896679
3896680
Out with the bathwater
the pot for everyone!
3896681
3896682
things they cared about to protect you.
There's no way they'd forgive you!
3896683
your precious "pride"! A brat like you
doesn't know the meaning of the word!
3896684

3896770

worried about you when she saw the video.
3896781
3896782
the Food Fight announcement in the
first place.
3896783

standing around here all day!
3896808
3896830
Skipping class without permission...
3896831
Well
3896832
3896833

3896834

3896835
Please accept my apology.
3896836
3896837

3896838

3896839
3896840

an adult for help right away. Got it?
3896842
3896843
3896844
Meet us at the rooftop after sixth period

all real.
3896875
went down with that Subway Slammer guy was
your doing?
3896877

3896878
on the subject. Now allow me to ask you
a question...
3896879
next job?
3896880
3896881
would improve our fighting capabilities...
3896882
bringing you into the fold would be
advantageous in another sense as well.
3896883
3896884
before? About wishing Miyazawa would admit
to his wrongdoing.
3896885
guys who changed Kiuchi's heart.
3896886
too
3896888
3896889
3896890
3896891
from stealing anyone else's hope.
3896892
3896893

that makes it pretty mysterious.
3896906
Being a chef and all.

3896922
Ms. Katayama super chill today? She took
Shun's excuse without batting an eye.
3896923
hide once too.
3896924
She just gets it
need to lie to her.
3896925
pissed all the time...
3896926
She was pretty well-known for—
3896927
3896928
3896929
without cleaning up from the Food Fight...
3896930
and his big mouth. After you left
made quite the scene...
3896931
from calling the police.
3896932
3896933
probably try to stir up some kind of
trouble again.
3896934
with him anymore.
3896935

Thanks for reminding me of what's
really important.

3896942
3896943
stole the shop and changed the soup.
3896944
to go looking for this Treasure thing
3896945
certainly be risky. We ought to
prepare thoroughly.
3896946
eliminated
proper arrangements.
3896947
head for Miyazawa's Palace to you
3896948
3896949
are four members strong. Now let's change
some hearts!
3896848
3896950
the <color=#FF423F>top floor</color> of that castle.
3896951
Miyazawa's heart? You said it was the reason
for his twisted desires
3896952
3896953
kinda weird? With the castle set
movie posters...
3896954
get
period pieces or something?
3896956
shows. That likely has something to do with
the cause of his corruption.
3896957
dress-up as king of a made-up castle.
3896958
Pops and Masa-san too.
3896990
3896991

3897037
3897038
Palace ruler's heart by unanimous decision.
3897039
not an act that should be taken lightly.
3897040
3897041
the change of heart or not?
3897042
3897043
but also for all the other shops he's
hurt too.
3897044
like this.
3897046
reached a consensus. We will change
Miyazawa's heart.
3897047
3897048
recognizes their Treasure is under threat of
being stolen
3897049
directly
he lives
3897050
always runnin' around filming at different
locations.
3897051
above the station like last time?
3897052
to expose myself like that again.
3897053
finished. It's too risky for many reasons...
3897054
3897055
3897056
do then?
3897057

3897058

me as I present just the results...
3897061

a true palate!
3897062
3897063

a live broadcast on the channel!
3897065

3897080
Thieves getting bigger

3897082
stand as the mark of the Phantom Thieves?
3897083
have logos that unify the team!
3897085
3897086

with detailed work like that.

greater power from him than before.
3897257
3897258
3897259
essence of a silver screen actor!
3897260
forced into a corner...!?
3897261
3897262
3897263
a clear shot.
3897264
a risk... What do you think
3897266
3897365
3897366
rampaging! Now we just have to steal
the Treasure!
3897367
3897368
3897369
Just take it and get out of here...
3897371
somethin' I've gotta ask him.
3897267
3897268
3897269
to you.
3897270
3897271
the Food Fight.
3897272
3897273
3897274
to become a star on the silver screen... Like
the ones I saw in films as a child...
3897275
so the only roles I ever got were background
extras...
3897276
become a "real" actor
starring role...
3897277
3897278
Always starving...
3897279
I'd suck up to all the actors who made
it big...
3897280
All the while crying to myself over how
pathetic I was...
3897281
my palate...
3897282
celebrity critic?
3897283
I started off giving proper
3897284
as I discovered different restaurants
found myself getting so irritated...
3897286
just like the real stars I used to idolize...
3897287
their heart
without looking back...
3897288
Victory Kitchen?
3897289
to do with it. Victory Kitchen's authentic
flavor made me feel all the more phony...
3897290
fake... That I threw away my pride as
an actor...
3897291
3897292
at Victory Kitchen... I'm the real fake...
3897293
own web that I couldn't turn back...
3897294
asinine... villain. I don't deserve to
live anymore...
3897295
3897296
lie to yourself about what you tasted.
3897297
have... is because of something you couldn't
turn your back on in that moment...
3897298
spent years cultivating.
3897299
3897300
anything.
3897301
gives a person pride and purpose.
3897302
3897303
aspirations
things in life don't always work out.
3897304
with
and aimless. Sometimes we just quit...
3897305
purpose for ourselves
into chasing it
3897306
struggle like that... but it doesn't make
stealing hope from other people right.
3897307
3897308
suffer
3897309
happened... Seriously reflect on your
actions
3897310
celebrity critic. I'll be the judge of what a
proud gourmet celebrity you've become.
3897311
3897312
bowl of ramen on the house.
3897313
3897314
3897315
3897316
so now is a good time to start over
from scratch...
3897317
everything. I'll make it all right again...
3897318
3897319
Miyazawa's heart.
3897321
3897322
up... I wanted to understand where he was
coming from before changing his heart.
3897323
with Kiuchi?
3897324
take the Treasure and get out of here!
3897325
3897326
up a pancake!
3897327
3897330
3897331
guys has really increased my stamina...
3897332
the last one.
3897333
3897334
3897335
3897337
3897338
total. So there are five more Palace rulers
out there somewhere.
3897339
means there are more people out there
like Miyazawa?
3897340
them
Phantom Thieves.
3897341
come back to you?
3897342
3897343
I think I may have been... wrong.
3897345
Cattle say something like that.
3897346
here like this. Let's talk about it once we
leave the Metaverse.
3897349
3897350
3897351
3897352
3897353
3897354
huh?
3897355
Is everything all right?
3897356
He's always busting his butt as leader.
3897357
3897359
a hand.
3897360
use my car form from there.
3897361
too...
3897380
3897381
small talk after the meeting...
3897382
3897383
3897384
3897389
3897385
3897386
3897387
3897390
3897388
3898000
his desires
3898001
3898002
3898003
condone anything he's done
regret changing his heart either.
3898004
for acting...
3898005
he'd have turned out differently...?
3898006
Kiuchi. Seems like he loved baseball ever
since he was a kid.
3898007
a professional player
corrupted his desires...
3898008
voice
for myself.
3898009
important I can't throw it away...
3898010
3898011
desire itself isn't always a bad thing.
3898012
3898013
there like that
3898014
body... Sort of...
3898015
3898016
3898017
hypothetically...
3898018
desires get corrupted?
3898019
3898021
Miyazawa's Treasure I...
3898022
3898023
speculation. I shouldn't be sharing
unverified information with you.
3898024
then expect us to forget about it!
3898025
3898026
3898027
human being.
3898028
3898029
someone pulling his strings from behind
the scenes.
3898030
3898031
corrupted Miyazawa's desires and caused his
Treasure to form.
3898032
3898034
Miyazawa do all those bad things!?
3898035
corrupted him!?
3898036
remember everything...
3898037
Miyazawa's Shadow disappeared it said
cut ties with me."
3898038
person gone he was free to start over...
3898039
all this?
3898040
now. In the meantime I'll try to make sense
of the memories that came back to me.
3898041
moment now.
3898050
3898051
3898053
Coming back to the real world makes the
Treasure return to its original form.
3898054
Treasure!?
3898055
to the movie stars he watched as a kid.
3898056
and his Shadow went out of control. That led
him to act out in the real world.
3898057
3898058
Miyazawa... Then they're the reason he ended
up that way
3898059
3898060
us this very minute.
3898061
watched here in the real world?
3898062
desires from two people already.
3898063
things behind the scenes
to assume that we may be on their radar.
3898065
high schoolers and an owl.
3898066
some big organization
chance against them.
3898067
3898069
to keep a level head
3898070
identities are safe and stick to business
as usual.
3898071
look suspicious.
3898072
3898073
beat
3898074
3898075
3898076
3898077
a long bath and sleep like a rock!
3898078
homework for Katayama-san...
3898079
3898080
right
after all.
3898081
3898082
see you at school!
3898083
Talk of this mastermind didn't seem to deter
those two one bit.
3898084
3898100
contrivance. People can relay thoughts to
each other without meeting in person.
3898101
being observed... We should maintain a degree
of caution in our virtual communications.
3898102
our actions more carefully.
3898104
a sort of brain
the Phantom Thieves...
3898105
up until now.
3898106
of brain
Phantom Thieves...
3898108
than logic.
3898109
puppet master's way of thinking and
anticipate their next move.
3898110
as a strategist.
3898111
him pulling one over on this mastermind.
That takes Shun out of the running.
3898112
candidate...
3898113
studying the Metaverse... That is truthfully
where I want to focus my efforts.
3898115
3898116
now. That's thanks to your contribution as
team leader.
3898117
on commanding the Phantom Thieves.
3898118
reliable leader. I have high hopes for your
efforts going forward.
3898122
3898140
3898141
3898142
online were total lies...
3898143
restaurants he shut down
of money ripping people off.
3898144
he was condemned as a Menace
3898145
But I guess pull back the curtain and he's
just a regular
3898146
team? Not a bad suggestion. I'll join you.
3898160
insensitive conduct I have perpetrated
against several restaurants...
3898161
them
3898162
I sincerely apologize.
3898163
3898164
for all I've done...
3898165
all media platforms.
3898166
behavior
3898167
reviews from your internet and television
appearances were fabricated?
3898168
from restaurants in exchange for
retracting reviews!?
3898169
3898170
business. How do you respond to this?
3898171
them
3898172
change of heart?
3898173
3898174
3898175
out of my heart...
3898176
3898177
in your announcement for the Victory Kitchen
chain?
3898178
3898179
the question!
3898190
confessed to everything...
3898191
Incredible...
3898192
the news. But actually seeing it firsthand
is something else...
3898193
3898194
bring Pops some good news.
3898196
worked together! Thanks to you too
3898197
This is like I-finished-all-my-
homework-level peace...
3898198
for Katayama-san!
3898199
you could...
3898200
problem though!
3898201
3898202
3898203
3898204
3898205
will turn out with this motley crew.
3898207
3898208
from now on
3898209
3898210
3902000
3902001
the way up here?
3902002
mastermind?
3902003
people's desires to bring about more Palaces?
3902004
discovering our true identities.
3902005
discussing our work in front of others
wherever possible.
3902006
class or the hallways.
3902007
shouldn't have to worry. Plus it's nice and
roomy.
3902008
3902009
temporary hideout.
3902011
and other important matters to this location.
3902012
gives us more voguish charm as phantom
thieves?
3902013
sponsored by ye olde dictionary.
3902014
phantom thieves without a hideout!
3902015
anything else with such voguish charm?
3902016
sponsored by ye olde dictionary.
3902017
3902018
I guarantee no one comes around here at
lunchtime.
3902019
cup ramen up here for a while now.
3902020
eating out in the fresh air!
3902021
a piece of bread?
3902022
3902023
flavor of the ramen.
3902024
3902026
toot my own horn
my specialty.
3902027
In that case
to some of that meat.
3902028
I guess I can split it in half.
3902029
<NAME2>. On that note
to help myself to some of that meat.
3902030
my rolled omelet? It's my specialty!
3902031
I accept your terms.
3902032
so I'll share some with you too.
3902035
something to tell us?
3902036
it will be once we've found them...
3902037
figure out who the next Palace ruler is
right?
3902038
Miyazawa out there.
3902039
the Treasure we secured from him to
aid our search.
3902040
of Mementos.
3902041
will be? Good enough for me. Let's go
right after school today.
3902042
ready to head out
3902043
getting a new teacher soon?
3902044
school year?
3902045
a regular teacher.
3902046
3902047
going to be teaching classes.
3902048
point of him coming here then?
3902050
what it is!
3902051
it's possible...
3902052
3902053
3902054
3902055
after school!
3902100
I'm Yamanashi
3902101
3902102
3902103
to working with you all.
3902104
sent by the school board.
3902105
3902106
so allow me to give a brief explanation.
3902107
teachers has become a major issue in
recent years.
3902108
administrative tasks
they don't get enough time off.
3902109
parental complaints. It all takes a heavy
mental toll.
3902110
to take work home with me? I could
drop dead any minute!
3902111
always be busy at this job
parent calls is a serious pain.
3902112
you're dealing with.
3902113
these days
replace them.
3902114
these problems at the source.
3902115
3902116
problems like unnecessary work and
eliminating them.
3902117
instructors can focus on teaching
their students.
3902118
3902119
easier
3902120
students tomorrow as a temporary
educational advisor.
3902121
to hearing what the students have to say.
3902122
visit your classrooms during your lessons.
3902123
you're more than welcome. Right
Ms. Katayama?
3902124
our attention on the students...
3902125
unauthorized home visits
3902126
3902127
yesterday saying their child's homeroom
teacher just showed up at their doorstep!
3902128
frequently leaves school early.
3902129
didn't answer
3902130
not see how inappropriate that is!?
3902131
and at school.
3902132
their child's teacher
of problems at home.
3902133
at school
to intervene!
3902134
3902135
3902136
3902137
Basically a smartphone for your eyes.
3902138
I was given.
3902139
3902140
It's against regulations.
3902141
3902142
on families can create more resistance
toward attending school.
3902143
qualified professionals should deal with
the situation.
3902144
that dire. That's why I need to meet
with the parents!
3902145
done anymore.
3902146
a big deal these days.
3902147
student
won't you?
3902148
3902149
them. If he doesn't feel safe at home...
3902150
3902151
here. Mr. Akashi agrees with me!
3902152
Avoid meeting students outside of school
period! Are we clear!?
3902153
3902154
back to work
3902155
working with you
3902200
make for perfect fodder.
3902201
goes to plan.
3902250
about tomorrow...
3902251
3902252
3902253
to announce.
3902254
3902255
3902256
tomorrow
3902257
get home safe and sound.
3902258
3902259
3902260
3902262
noisy
blew up like that.
3902263
3902264
got anger issues.
3902265
teacher like that. What a Menace.
3902266
3902267
to start bad-mouthing behind her back?
3902274
3902268
3902269
3902270
spectacular entrance?
3902271
If you're gonna talk shit
person's face.
3902272
to the next area
3902300
should be able to enter the next area.
3902301
the second area. Let's go
3902350
3902351
Updating guidance information.
3902352
3902353
we discover new places too.
3902354
kinda creepy?
3902355
reception in the Metaverse
just fine.
3902356
before
3902357
kept coming back every time I deleted it.
3902358
3902359
be part of the memories I lost.
3902360
Metaverse Navigator. That's the extent of
my knowledge on the subject.
3902361
3902362
understand it.
3902363
a snake?
3902364
of an ouroboros.
3902365
3902366
3902367
eternal loop. It symbolizes the cyclical
nature of the universe.
3902368
3902369
3902370
snake monster?
3902372
3902373
3902374
are we assuming a person made this?
3902375
really mean anything.
3902376
anything. No reason to overthink it.
3902377
app helped change Miyazawa's heart.
3902378
Meta Nav.
3902379
ruler and change their heart ASAP!
3902380
the collective unconscious of this area.
3902381
3902382
3902383
aura is coming this way!
3902384
3902385
3902386
3902388
sure we defeated it back then.
3902389
but it's attacking!
3902430
normal Shadow.
3902431
3902432
we fought and defeated it.
3902433
reappeared again?
3902434
like the power of its desire had grown.
3902435
being constantly reborn here without end?
3902436
their desires would mean...
3902437
world would have already fallen into chaos.
3902438
what kind of Shadow was it?
3902439
something we need to be wary of
going forward.
3902440
looking for signs of the Palace.
3902441
the next Palace's ruler...
3902442
hiding their evil deeds like Miyazawa did?
3902443
to catch the public's attention.
3902444
the voices from their Palace alone. We need
more intel.
3902445
the Metaverse?
3902447
problems going on in the real world and go
from there.
3902448
before I became a phantom thief.
3902449
I'm sure we're all exhausted from the battle.
3902450
I'll leave that decision up to our leader.
3902500
3902501
3902502
He's a Menace.
3902503
3903857
immune to them. What a nuisance. We'll need
to act carefully.
3903858
This next one may shock you.
3903859
hurt quite a bit.
3903901
we got him on the ropes!
3903902
3903903
little fools who know nothing but violence.
3903904
the hierarchy at play.
3903905
feeble brains can comprehend...
3903906
3903907
3903908
so far!
3903909
for nothing?
3903910
possible it'll just keep recovering!
3903911
Wonder
3903913
3903950
and run.
3903951
3903952
3903953
Is it invincible?
3903954
the ground.
3903955
it recover or something?
3903956
absorbed the energy of the Palace through
that cable.
3903958
being shaped like a dam.
3903959
the dam and using it to power itself?
3903960
away at that thing for years and it wouldn't
take a scratch!
3903961
ruler's own design. Unfairness is to
be expected.
3903962
What's a thing like that doing here in
the first place?
3903963
like this before. Anyway...
3903964
there's still the number lock to
contend with.
3903965
course of action.
3903980
to reality
3904020
3904021
supposed to be Ms. Katayama's Shadow?
3904022
couldn't possibly be her!
3904023
real-life counterparts. They manifest the
desires of their other self.
3904024
themself
different than how they look in reality.
3904025
thing have a man's voice?
3904026
image of Ms. Katayama
3904027
reminded me of a different person entirely.
3904029
Mr. Akashi! Tone and everything!
3904030
too
3904031
3904032
Mr. Akashi's!
3904033
it too.
3904034
It was Mr. Akashi's?
3904035
couldn't be a Palace ruler!
3904036
Kumi Katayama.
3904037
by Katayama.
3904038
be in there
3904039
constructed him as well. Like a sort of
cognitive being.
3904040
3904041
Katayama imagines in her heart.
3904042
in her heart protects the Palace?
3904043
shining armor though.
3904044
3904045
cognitive being...
3904046
if we learn more about the relationship
between them.
3904047
with them!
3904048
find out why Katayama-san ended up with a
Palace in the first place
3904049
We should head home and get some rest.
3904119
and roast pork! *shlurp*
3904120
with you tonight! Don't forget!
3904160
you
3904161
Yamagoshi-san!
3904162
meal is our treat!
3904163
special ramens
two bowls!
3904164
3904166
thanks we need.
3904167
can't finish!
3904168
3904169
at least!
3904170
3904171
3904172
since the reopenin'. Some apprentice!
Ya break an ol' man's heart.
3904173
come the second I knew!
3904174
really okay to give roast pork to an owl?
3904176
the pet owl comin' right up!
3904177
place to yourselves today.
3904178
the pork. Hope you're hungry
3904179
3904180
with bonito goodness!
3904181
3904182
3904183
keep this flavor all to yourselves!? The
nerve...
3904184
into a restaurant. We had to book the place
out just so you could try the food.
3904185
and Masa-san would freak out if they heard
you.
3904186
people can't hear my voice.
3904187
who can use the Metaverse Navigator
to understand me.
3904188
strength of heart that you all possess.
3904189
just how it is...
3904190
about?
3904191
3904192
just about to start cooking my ramen.
3904193
3904194
3904195
makes me so happy.
3904196
class
3904197
two know each other?
3904198
and Masa-san were hopin' to ask about her
today.
3904199
here since they were students
3904200
she was around your age.
3904201
you'd hardly recognize 'em.
3904202
rashness of youth. Sorry about all that.
3904203
delinquents...?
3904204
delinquents.
3904205
3904207
how she is now.
3904208
3904209
about Katayama-san now
3904210
now as a delinquent!
3904211
Legs Katayama
3904212
3904213
mean?
3904214
in the city.
3904215
fightin' for control over the rest.
3904216
3904217
River
to serve up some justice.
3904218
of delinquents from another school with just
a left kick.
3904219
Legs! That's so awesome!
3904220
really known for pedaling her bike crazy
fast.
3904221
night
pedal after us till she caught up.
3904222
3904223
pretty cringey...
3904224
didn't really have a safe place to call home.
3904225
tryin' to forget about her troubles.
3904226
bowl a ramen sayin'
today!"
3904227
3904228
fuse. Back then it got 'er mixed up in all
kinds a fights with other delinquents.
3904229
real sympathetic to 'er.
3904230
hard to be a teacher.
3904231
leaf and started studyin' ramen.
3904232
3904233
came about from all that!
3904234
pork for the owl right away!
3904235
3904236
3904237
delicious!
3904238
again sometime.
3904239
3904240
3904241
about Katayama and Akashi.
3904242
3904243
Ms. Katayama for a long time...
3904244
3904245
3904246
3904247
3904248
3904300

that
3904306
Lightning Legs thing was news to me though.

3904311

I cannot accept favors from teachers.

to do.

Does me staying busy trouble you in some way?

long time now...
3904386
I'm supposed to inherit Umetane?

got violent with another student.

3904401
3904402
They are individuals.
3904403
is a thing of the past. We must all respect each
other as independent people.
3904404
you don't seem to realize
is just...
3904405
3904406

3904407

3904414
Ms. Katayama! What on earth do you think
you're doing!?
3904415
3904416

no one about this! Got it!?

3904430

3904431

3904474
and threatened him. She's totally off the
deep end.
3904475
Menace. She's lost it.
3904476
3904477
do anything
would it?
3904478
now. Should we post a pic of the notice to
Divine Justice?
3904479
3904480
3904481
your classrooms at once.
3904482
when it went down?
3904483

Tell him she's a violent Menace of a teacher.

3904491
what happened?
3904492
3904493

3904496

3904540

Mr. Akashi rushed to the scene...
3904542
academic coordinator and a number of other
students witnessed.
3904543
that?
3904544
in the Metaverse.
3904545
been able to take down the Palace?
3904546
Shadow... Could we have prevented this?
3904547
rationally for a moment.
3904548
I hypothesize that it may be a cognitive form
born from Katayama's mind.
3904549
toward Akashi in real life may have changed
but...
3904550
not have used violence against Mr. Akashi?
3904551
protecting Ms. Katayama's Palace?
3904552
throw hands with would be the symbol that
protects her heart.
3904553
3904554
he must be a big deal to Katayama-san in some
respect.
3904555
know for a fact he's connected to the Palace.
3904556
try asking the other teachers?
3904557
3904558
3904559
but I just want to confirm...
3904560
Mr. Akashi?
3904562
about again...? *whistling*
3904563
3904564
about Ms. Katayama...
3904565
investigating Mr. Akashi.
3904566
3904567
3904569
at school.
3904570
tellin' us to help you without givin' a
reason?
3904571
3904572
3904573
3904574
the scene
her?
3904575
stopping her.
3904576
out why this situation occurred in the first
place.
3904577
3904578
meet somewhere off campus?
3904580
then
3904581
3904582
trust her then.
3904583
3904584
on us. Some hideout this is.
3904585
our surroundings next time.
3904586
coming from.
3904620
to know if we can meet after school.
3904621
so she wants us to meet her in Kichijoji
tonight.
3904622
3904623
evening and head to <color=#FF423F>Kichijoji</color> together.
3904650
3904651
3904680
We're meeting at a <color=#FF423F>café</color>
3904681
imported food vendors ahead...
3904682
Looks like they're filmin' somethin'.
3904683
in front of the camera over there?
3904730
Station until the end of the week.
3904731
in the area.
3904732
3904733
3904734
Is this for TV!?
3904735
It's already the time that we agreed to meet
isn't it?
3904736
Would you mind waiting a little?
3904737
Wow! It's like you're a celebrity
or something!
3904738
as a model?
3904739
 That was an ad for our shop.
3904740
on the evening news.
3904741
3904742
Her father's the president of Umetane.
3904743
3904744
The ones in all those commercials on TV!?
3904746
but I had no idea it was to Umetane.
3904747
3904748
Thank you so much for your patronage.
3904749
on a dime like that.
3904750
broth. Their stuff is super high quality.
3904751
out there!
3904752
so you could say I owe a lot to Umetane.
3904753
Thank you so much for your patronage.
3904754
3904755
Riko-senpai. It looks amazing on you!
3904757
3904758
even if it's just flattery.
3904759
3904760
Anyone could pull it off. What are you even saying?
3904761
But I think he might be right.
3904762
3904763
this
3904764
I'll come meet you as soon as
I've finished changing.
3904800
after inviting you out.
3904801
But when will you be on TV!?
I'll be sure to watch!
3904802
so I doubt you will see all that much of me.
3904803
3904804
3904805
Did Katayama really attack him?
3904806
I'll tell you everything I saw.
3904807
trying to provoke Ms. Katayama.
3904808
 just happened to be there to witness it?
Way too convenient
3904809
of the story it may be a little
subjective
3904810
conclusion I did. There are too many
of these "coincidences" to overlook.
3904811
3904812
not to make contact with students
outside of class.
3904813
did say something like that to her.
3904814
reaching out to students she was
concerned about.
3904815
she can't just throw 'em to the lions.
She's not that kinda person.
3904816
But what if someone
decided to use that against her?
3904818
3904819
and interfering at every turn. It's been a
source of frustration for her.
3904820
You witnessed a similar incident yourself
didn't you
3904821
talking to Katayama-san on the roof.
3904822
I was wondering what he was doing there!
3904823
Menace
emotionally vulnerable state.
3904824
to the students. Not being allowed to interact
with them is making matters worse.
3904825
That's the state she was in when she came to talk
to me that day.
3904826
knowing all of that...
3904827
for the academic coordinator and those two
girls to witness everything.
3904828
3904829
3904830
His smart glasses.
3904831
specs he wears?
3904832
from the second he entered the room.
3904833
turn violent on him
3904834
3904836
3904837
but I believe there's good reason to be
suspicious of him.
3904838
It seems he used to work as a
business consultant.
3904839
improved and achieved great success.
3904840
skill as a consultant...
3904841
on anonymous message boards.
3904842
3904843
3904844
who Akashi falsely accused of fraud. During
the litigation
3904845
3904846
dangerous person on our hands!
3904847
so there's no way to know if they're real.
That said...
3904848
demoralizes the teachers and makes students
less trusting of them.
3904849
as a consultant was done with the best
intentions in mind.
3904850
he alone is in a position to succeed.
3904851
from the start!
3904852
Damn that bastard!
3904853
Could that be what's in store for her too?
3904854
What else should we investigate!?
3904855
{NAME2}
3904856
What if she's secretly on Akashi's side!?
3904857
3904858
3904859
with our investigation first
3904861
3904862
in Ms. Katayama and were suspicious
of Mr. Akashi.
3904863
to give. Do you all know anything?
3904864
3904865
is up to. I reached out to you because you're
suspicious of him too.
3904866
to give. Do you all know anything?
3904867
3904868
obtain more information?
3904869
the information we find. 
What do you think?
3904870
suspicious of Akashi... A deal of sorts.
3904871
 enough. What should we do
3904873
3904874
to have you on our side
3904876
being a bit confrontational at first...
3904877
a year apart
more casually.
3904878
on Mr. Akashi?
3904879
explaining. Will you hear me out?
3904900
3904901
with Ms. Katayama. Arai-san
3904902
3904903
But I thought you were on her side?
3904904
how violent she is!
3904905
the school if you don't mind listening.
3904906
for students' requests.
3904907
3904908
The selection of sweets is really lacking!
3904909
I would looove if we could hold
a baseball tournament!
3904910
become a lengthy discussion
set aside time to talk another day.
3904911
to discuss with her?
3904912
desk work
the data for you.
3904913
The breeze up there is great!
3904914
3904915
I'll step out for a moment to talk.
3904916
3904917
3904918
3904919
when he's in front of students. Maybe it's
to look more relatable?
3904920
That act was flawless.
3904921
ever since we were kids. I gave her a script
to work with for today
3904922
I bet she could have a future in theater.
3904923
3904924
to write down his password. Maybe something
can give me a hint...
3904925
3904926
3904927
They'll be back any minute!
3904928
3904929
3904930
How'd you do that!?
3904931
3904932
image and video files...
Huh? This is...
3904933
3904934
3904936
All thanks to you three.
3904937
Is there anything else of note?
3904938
You two should get out of here quickly.
3904939
in Kichijoji later.
3904940
Be careful
3904970
again. I thought it best if we met somewhere
far from school.
3904971
whatever you'd like.
3904972
3904973
Akashi's PC. It's the least I can do.
3904974
stole the show.
3904976
Riko-senpai wrote the script for me!
3904977
the pastries and baseball tournament!
3904978
That explains it.
3904979
No one would have doubted you for a second.
3904980
3904981
Let's see...
3904982
3904983
but I found several photos and videos
of Ms. Katayama.
3904984
3904985
3904987
I think he's trying to find her weakness.
3904988
taken by those two students stored on his PC.
3904989
3904990
as much... but it turns out that was a lie.
3904991
to Divine Justice was...!
3904992
anonymous
3904993
but I can contact you once I'm finished.
3904994
3904995
to Akashi's PC.
3904996
in Katayama's Palace.
3904997
3904998
password? How'd you figure it out?
3904999
3905000
apparently he worked at a TV station.
3905001
Wow
3905002
of photos from that time.
3905003
so I thought it must be important...
3905004
Of course
in mind.
3905005
If I had to figure that out
3905006
3905007
3905008
if we want to investigate more and stuff.
3905009
But do you promise not to misuse it?
3905011
3905012
3905013
He's just uhhh
Isn't that right...?
3905014
3905015
3905016
Notebook
3905040
I'm confident we can get through that lock.
3905041
Let's head to the Palace right now!
3905042
3905043
3905044
3905045
3905046
So
3905047
so I should hurry back home!
3905048
3905050
Be careful on your way home.
3905051
3905052
3905053
3905054
Also...
3905057
It didn't belong to any of them.
3905090
3905091
challenging. We'd best prepare accordingly.
3905092
We'll wait right here for you!
3905093
3905120
they doing?
3905095
3905096
when you're ready!
3905121
3905122
3905123
here.
3905124
3905125
3905150
3905151
3905152
3905153
that password protected door in Katayama's
Palace. Understood?
3905154
3905155
3905156
3905157
transformed into a car
3905158
3905190

3905191
3905192
3905193
3905194
3905195
you to transform again.
3905196
would know... But if you insist.
3905197
nothing down there
3905198
around here...
3905199
there!
3905200
the real world
3905201
3905202
glanced at the number. I think it started
with a 9 maybe?
3905203
being kind of long...
3905205
3905206
3905207
number! I was inside Wonder's bag!
3905208
3905209
for that password! I'm livid!
3905210
3905211
3905212
furious with you!
3905213
3905214
3905215
have to go back to the real world and ask
Riko-senpai again.
3905216
3905217

everyone else have code names too?

believe something like this exists.
3905229
clue either.
3905230
I opened an odd app on my phone and found
myself here.
3905231
on your phone too?
3905232
3905233
3905234
we really far from the entrance right now?
3905235
by yourself!?
3905236
uh... I mean
3905237
didn't run into any trouble.
3905238
3905239
3905240
it led me.
3905241
after all. Oh
3905242
3905243
from it. In fact
3905244
3905245
3905246
some hostile danger approaching.
3905247
How could it detect that earlier than I!?
3905248
we talkin' about!?
3905249
3905250
ourselves to get caught up in a battle!
3905251
It seems our only path is through that door.
3905252
3905253
We can't take you with us.
3905254
but...!
3905255
possibility of danger ahead. In that case
shouldn't we proceed forward?
3905256
into this keypad
3905257
the password in it!
3905258
3905259
3905260
Shadow thing!
3905261

3905301
sensed an invader prowling around.
3905302

3905303
3905304
you explain this place to me?
3905305
3905306
unconscious of humankind. And this
dam facility...
3905307
Ms. Katayama's heart. Is that correct?
3905308
3905309
than us.
3905310
heart is
Mr. Akashi.
3905311
3905312
3905313
3905314
Ms. Katayama's Palace?
3905315
here by the collective unconscious using
her name.
3905316
Yet
an enigma.
3905317

Or perhaps
3905323
3905325
Ms. Katayama could ever know his password in
the first place.

her students.
3905685
3905686

3905688
good thing! Why is she getting flack
for that!?
3905689
right now?
3905690
ignore the students and overwork Riko-senpai.
3905691
Akashi stole Katayama-san's desire
3905692
3905693
we thought this was Katayama's Palace
3905694
certainly feels amiss.
3905695
bottom of this.
3905696
her students...
3905697
3905750
3905751
3905752
places to hide.
3905753
Tanemura is with us. We should search for
another route.

3905756
3905757
3905758
3905759
3905760

3905777
3905778
3905779
3905780
3905781
3905782

right? Let's all calm down!
3905954
3905955
3905956
3905957
3905958
own cognition?
3905959
3905960
3905961
3905962
3905964
Akashi's weak aura
3905965
two distinct human beings.
3905966
of who...
3905967
3905968
even possible!?
3905969
a phenomenon would occur.
3905970
It's your job to eliminate intruders.
3905971
3905972
3905973
K Academy! Now give those kids a good beating!
3905974
3905975
again. And now you can't even punish the
students like the Menace you are?

3906002
3906003
not even sure...what I'm doing anymore...
3906004
3906005
3906006
your guard up and defend yourselves!
3906007
being controlled by that bastard!
3906008
Shadows first!
3906009
I won't hurt my students!
3906050
that incompetence...
3906051
3906052
3906053
chickenshit!
3906054
dirty work.
3906055
like the real Akashi!
3906056
3906057
3906058
3906060
3906061
3906062
3906063
What kind of sappy soap is this?
3906064
weakest?" I spy a young lady in uniform.
3906065
A blueblood should know better than
to trespass!
3906066
You can handle that much
3906067
3906068
3906069
3906070
3906072
3906073
3906074

3906087
3906088
3906089
you put yourself at risk to protect me?
3906090
3906091
teachers get terrible ratings these days!
3906092
who talks with their fists. Now...
3906093
then play the role expected of you!
3906130
3906131
3906132
3906133
next time.
3906134
3906135
And leaders do not show weakness.
3906136
grades that won't bring embarrassment on our
name. Understood?
3906137
3906138
president's daughter.
3906139
you for you?
3906140
would even look at you!
3906141
heir to Umetane.
3906142
to become worthy of my title.
3906143
3906144
to give up on it.
3906145
3906146
3906147
3906200
3906201
3906202
3906203

3906204
just kept...
3906205
3906206
3906207
are to blame.
3906208
3906209
that to you.
3906210
trusting anyone.
3906211
rejection
3906212
3906213
in front of me!
3906214
3906215
sitcom schtick will only bore viewers
to tears.
3906216
someone would love you?
3906217
3906218
girls are like oil and water! You really
are a fool!
3906219
single person in your life...
3906220
influence!
3906221
3906222
hear
3906223
young lady you are!
3906224
3906225
3906226
3906227
3906228
exploitation!
3906229
3906230
Dispose of them!
3906270
3906271
3906272
3906273
3906274
3906275
3906276
no choice but to defeat Kumi Katayama's
Shadow.
3906277

love for her students—Kei Akashi! I will
take back everything you've stolen!
3906289
3906290
3906291
which you feared
and abandoned...
3906292
But I presume you are well aware.
3906293
dark isolation that surround you...
3906294
3906340
a Persona!
3906295
forests
3906296
3906297
3906298
3906299
3906300
like it before!
3906301
3906302
3906303
3906304
3906305
useless teacher!
3906306
intruders! Hop to it!
3906307
3906308
3906341
abilities seem quite invaluable.
3906342
incredibly strong!
3906344
your backs!
3906370
3906371
save her ASAP!
3906372
3906373
3906374

3906382
3906383
3906384
b) you're kinda ham-fisted
3906385
3906387
as a fellow girl?
3906388
to do it
3906389
be gentle... probably?
3906390
3906391
3906392
and catch my breath if possible.
3906393
Wonder!
3906450
believe you have a Persona too
3906451
3906452
over me
3906453
was still giving you support.
3906455
time. In this world of withering desire...
3906456
investigate Akashi
great personal risk doing so.
3906457
bloomed and your Persona partially awakened.
3906458
3906459
This form is quite modish
3906460
owl hiding in {NAME1}-kun's bag...
3906461
was starting to awaken.
3906462
3906463
don't you think?
3906464
3906465
Very modish!"
3906466
would say it's more soigné
you agree?
3906467
3906468
3906469
that is simple yet elegant.
3906470
3906471
I'm talking about! Aren't Motoha and Shun
utterly exasperating!?
3906473
backs
3906474
3906475
high schooler to understand such hard words!
3906476
3906477
3906478
conversation
3906479
catching up with me. I'd like to get home
and lay down.
3906480
so you could rest.
3906481
3906482
Motoha.
3906483
Let's talk more then.
3906484
Get some well-earned rest
3906520
ought to retire as well.
3906560
3906561
behest of my master who wishes a word.
3906563
with you as usual.
3906564
particular question I would like you
to answer.
3906565
3906566
their withered desire.
3906567
fumbling to grasp at just a little...
3906568
3906569
manipulate and consume the desires of others.
3906570
this way...
3906571
you chose?
3906573
3906574
response.
3906575
3906576
drive desire.
3906577
3906578
3906579
your desire
the achievements you have made thus far.
3906580
this"mastermind" you all speak of.
3906582
the answers you seek on this journey.
3906583
you must remain on the winning side.
3906584
3906650
and Hiromu Miyazawa were a result
of your "work."
3906651
and Akashi.
3906652
same place?
3906653
3906654
the rulers of one Palace.
3906655
A "Joint Palace
meticulous old-timer finally hit the bricks."
3906669
3906670
3906671
have opinions!?
3906672
3906673
3906674
someone just because you don't agree with
them is... odd.
3906675
fix inefficiency and unfair practices.
3906676
it's better for everyone to cooperate and
aim for success together.
3906677
always revolve around a "villain."
3906678
proactive
the credit.
3906679
3906681
3906682
company has its share of bad apples
after all.
3906683
employees suddenly being incriminated right
after Akashi arrives...
3906684
3906685
the seeds of discord at these companies?
3906686
at this...
3906687
Rider" everyone's talking about.
3906688
3906689
3906690
3906691
public bathroom
3906692
3906693
also means...
3906694
Hit-and-Run Rider.
3906695
a Menace and fill his villain role.
3906696
be labeled violent!?
3906697
can look like some great consultant!
3906698
smart glasses as a means to catch his
villains in the act.
3906699
impossible for them to escape accusation.
3906700
suffered severe emotional dysregulation...
and even lost their lives.
3906701
desires away...
3906702
3906703
3906704
fall victim.
3906705
3906706
people like Ms. Katayama for his own gain!
3906709
3906710
the train!
3906711
Akashi came into the picture.
3906712
Ms. Katayama's reckless cycling habit.
3906713
3906714
to ride her bike for hours whenever she
got upset.
3906715
terrorizing the neighborhood is not
so great
3906716
pent-up stress from school.
3906717
frustration.
3906719
I used to be kinda scared of her
probably showed...
3906720
ask for help when I needed it.
3906722
return to the topic at hand?
3906723
and Katayama's Shadows from running amuck
after all.
3906724
continue explaining my thoughts...
3906725
3906726
ride her bike there like Masa-san said.
3906727
occurred to me as Lufel spoke just now.
3906728
between the two rulers?
3906729
3906730
really
on her bike...
3906731
improve his own station.
3906732
energy
3906733
cable into the ground to heal himself!
3906734
No... He's leeching off Katayama-san's heart!
3906736
to that door in the Palace.
3906737
be the one in charge.
3906738
and Ms. Katayama is just being
exploited by him.
3906739
3906740
even a speck on Lufel's radar!
3906741
Shadows in Mementos.
3906742
3906743
more like a parasite.
3906744
Ms. Katayama being controlled by anyone!
3906745
3906746
Katayama's energy
3906747
We will need to cut off his source of
power first.
3906748
Katayama's Treasure and invoke a change
of heart.
3906749
3906750
Katayama-san could be a Palace ruler.
3906751
let out by pullin' risky stunts in secret...
3906752
I can at least sorta pay her back
for everythin'.
3906753
3906754
desires getting twisted.
3906755
she really is
3906756
We can't let that creep treat her like an
energy drink anymore. Right
3906758
unanimous decision.
3906759
to secure a route to her Treasure.
3906760
sniff it out.
3906761
3906762
return to the Palace.
3906800
3906801
Riko-senpai!?
3906802
Another tidbit from Akashi's surveillance.
3906803
she's suspended
3906804
or somethin'?
3906805
order drinks. Besides...
3906806
here to check for errant students.
3906808
3906809
3906810
what are they doing going into a bar?
3906811
3906812
3906850
aren't you?
3906851
a few minutes.
3906852
3906853
3906854
come from!?
3906855
3906856
so we came to you instead.
3906857
3906858
3906859
3906860
3906861
reached out to me. And yet...
3906862
care
3906863
Calling you overbearing...
3906864
3906865
I was happy.
3906866
concern made me until now.
3906867
abandoned. All of the support and care...
3906868
3906869
never let myself trust you
3906870
I won't give up on you.
3906871
3906872
3906873
3906874
to hear you say that. Thank you...
3906875
3906876
3906877
so... tired.
3906878
3906879
Hit-and-Run Rider
3906880
3906881
3906882
example. Not go on reckless joyrides.
3906883
3906884
3906885
desires away from you.
3906886
3906887
3906888
3906889
3906890
3906891
I just acted like a brat and made
things worse.

remaining power level.

3907513
trapped in this Palace forever.
3907515
3907516
chickenshit to a new level!
3907517

3907523
3907524
3907525

3907578
locked and he's hypervigilant of intruders.
3907579
3907580
the Palace's security might ease up.
3907581
did he?
3907702
they're most likely at the "power plant"...
3907703
Treasure. We should go make sure it's

COOP200012
COOP200013
COOP200014
without this!
COOP200016
The city's been pretty strict about having
them lately.
COOP200017
right here...
COOP200018
street performance permit.
COOP200019
COOP200020
to sing just fades away.
COOP200021
and perform in front of so many people...
COOP200022
stand on the street with a guitar.
COOP200023
COOP200025
music ever since.
COOP200026
I was in a band
COOP200027
song my old bandmates and I wrote.
COOP200031
with my friends in high school too.
COOP200032
had any problems when it was just us.
COOP200033
with me that get it too?
COOP200034
COOP200035
you
COOP200036
helped me relax
COOP200037
COOP200038
COOP200039
I'll have to try this another time.
COOP200040
COOP200041
I feel like I might be able to sing with
you here.
COOP200043
COOP200044
know already. Ayaka Sakai. I'm in college.
COOP200046
COOP200047
contact info?
COOP200048
so I'd love to chat sometime...
COOP200051
COOP200100
COOP200101
can't work up the nerve.
COOP200102
and watch
COOP200104
COOP200105
time
COOP200106
COOP200111
COOP200112
COOP200114
me and no one was listening...
COOP200115
street performing thing.
COOP200117
the intro yet.
COOP200118
and here I am moping around...
COOP200119
COOP200120
COOP200121
COOP200122
COOP200123
COOP200124
COOP200125
I haven't worked up the nerve to...
COOP200126
COOP200127
COOP200128
COOP200129
COOP200130
COOP200131
COOP200134
to drink...
COOP200135
the nerves.
COOP200136
COOP200137
to sing for real today!
COOP200140
COOP200141
COOP200142
my problems...
COOP200143
your time...
COOP200144
COOP200146
you here did make me feel better.
COOP200147
you later.
COOP200200
COOP200201
COOP200202
stay and watch like last time?
COOP200204
I promise! Just hold on while I set up!
COOP200205
time
COOP200206
performance. But today I'm giving it my all!
COOP200207
Today's the day for sure...
COOP200208
COOP200212
COOP200213
But I tried so hard to cover them up...
COOP200216
time we were here?
COOP200217
friends from high school.
COOP200218
what got me into music.
COOP200219
imagined doing it myself.
COOP200220
I don't think I'd be who I am today.
COOP200221
college. Our bandmates all went to
different schools...
COOP200222
just quit playing music one day.
COOP200223
after that.
COOP200225
motivation for it all of a sudden.
COOP200226
broken up the band and not abandoned
music entirely...
COOP200227
Ryoko's passion for music was waning.
COOP200228
trying to keep it up...
COOP200229
of heart is a better way to put it...
COOP200230
my own band or join another one.
COOP200231
thought I'd try that...
COOP200232
either... I still haven't actually sung
anything.
COOP200233
music is because I've been relying on Ryoko
and the rest of the band...
COOP200234
I'd never be able to play anything solo...
COOP200235
that
COOP200236
lately...
COOP200239
COOP200240
today either
COOP200242
COOP200243
at least. Thanks.
COOP200244
you say that.
COOP200245
COOP200247
together. I should learn from you.
COOP200248
COOP200300
came
COOP200301
play music here after all.
COOP200302
helps me feel calm.
COOP200304
work
COOP200305
bit. Come say hi if you're free later.
COOP200306
around here. Would you happen to have any
ideas
COOP200309
COOP200310
it's a bit out of the way.
COOP200312
aren't many people around now
play without getting in trouble.
COOP200313
nervous...
COOP200315
COOP200316
never sung in front of you at all
COOP200317
COOP200318
to be just you. It's... nice?
COOP200319
COOP200322
COOP200324
I appreciate it.
COOP200325
voice out. I'm so rusty...
COOP200328
performed at all.
COOP200329
Although I liked playing
to stand out.
COOP200330
The girl we saw in Shibuya the other day.
COOP200331
do the vocals.
COOP200332
our band wrote together.
COOP200333
and performed it at our school festival.
COOP200334
an audience listen to my voice like that.
COOP200335
even after our band broke up.
COOP200336
COOP200338
had some way to kick myself into gear...
COOP200339
able to sing through to the end after those
first few notes.
COOP200340
singing
COOP200342
you that?
COOP200343
important for a mid-tempo ballad.
COOP200344
first
singing?
COOP200345
It was written for a band
clear rhythm...
COOP200346
alone
COOP200347
same time...
COOP200349
before singing? Like sports teams do?
COOP200350
COOP200351
COOP200352
COOP200354
COOP200355
COOP200356
COOP200357
should feel like a breeze.
COOP200358
this now.
COOP200360
my own. Performing really does feel good!
COOP200361
COOP200363
COOP200365
everyone's socks off. Of course
know before so you can see!
COOP200400
busking today!
COOP200401
COOP200403
COOP200404

COOP200429

COOP200430
as a fill after the first verse? Then after
that...
COOP200431
COOP200432
COOP200433
around here.

COOP200445
COOP200447
COOP200449
COOP200450
COOP200451
COOP200452

COOP200454
COOP200455
COOP200456
COOP200458
COOP200460
tambourine of all things!
COOP200461
managed to sing my song.
COOP200462
down thumping inside me...
COOP200463
even on my own.
COOP200464
incredible day.
COOP200465
COOP200466
bit hungry to do more. You see...
COOP200467
I've made from scratch.
COOP200468
so I don't know how long it'll take.
COOP200469
COOP200471
COOP200472
COOP200473
right now...
COOP200474
song I can write.
COOP200476
you later.
COOP200480
COOP200503
COOP200505
COOP200506
middle of a song!
COOP200508
jam sesh together.
COOP200509
to my performances these days!
COOP200510
I can't thank you enough.
COOP200511
wanted to ask you.
COOP200512
talked about...
COOP200513
{NAME1}-kun? The lyrics or melody?
COOP200515
full of what the singer's trying to say too.
COOP200516
best way to convey a song's feeling.
COOP200517
you have both the words and music.
COOP200518
haven't really gotten anywhere with either.
COOP200519
like to sing about
to play...
COOP200520
I just can't pick a thing to work on.
COOP200521
and beat structure is pretty easy
COOP200522
from scratch. What should I do...?
COOP200524
COOP200525
feelings through song makes me happy?
COOP200526
COOP200527
We all kept tossing in ideas till we had
a song.
COOP200528
specifically
COOP200529
COOP200530
something click for me.
COOP200531
get home. I feel like it'll be a breeze now!
COOP200532
You really are—
COOP200533
embarrassing just now...
COOP200534
COOP200535
after this?
COOP200536
you'd like to stay and listen...
COOP200537
COOP200600
COOP200603
COOP200607
COOP200608
recently
COOP200609
we've been doing
quit music.
COOP200610
ever since high school.
COOP200611
family stuff and worries that she wasn't
talented enough...
COOP200612
while playing guitar
rhythm at all.
COOP200613
the basics back in high school!
COOP200614
now. I mean
COOP200615
Ayaka. More than I ever was.
COOP200616
COOP200617
of our dreams come true.
COOP200618
it takes to be great.
COOP200619
COOP200620
Keep at it
COOP200621
COOP200622
play music with me again.
COOP200623
the song I'm working on...
COOP200624
COOP200626
COOP200627
don't know how to put it all into words...
COOP200628
COOP200629
COOP200630
COOP200631
when I feel like this
COOP200632
person I want to listen to this song is you.
COOP200633
COOP200636
whole medley of sad songs...
COOP200637
comforting to sing than cheerful ones.
COOP200638
COOP200640
COOP200641
making you listen to my feelings all
the time.
COOP200642
COOP200643
be nice to be the teacher for once.
COOP200644
COOP200645
next time? You can bring your bass.
COOP200646
COOP200700
COOP200703
COOP200705
a message.
COOP200706
About playing a song together?
COOP200707
time
COOP200708
first
COOP200709
waiting here
COOP200710
to talk
COOP200713
just started playing?
COOP200714
but it's also just... really fun to play
with you.
COOP200715
together. I'm jealous of your bandmates!
COOP200716
festival or anything? If so
COOP200717
COOP200718
I noticed it with the tambourine
COOP200719
like you're ready to back up anything I play.
COOP200720
that feeling
for me...
COOP200722
but I've had an inkling for a while.
COOP200724
say that... Why am I the embarrassed one!?
COOP200725
don't lie.
COOP200726
COOP200727
COOP200728
It's going slow
COOP200729
pop up in my mind and it gives me writer's
block...
COOP200730
things too. Like all the fun times we had
in the band.
COOP200731
Those kinds of memories.
COOP200732
you today is gonna be one of those too.
COOP200733
them come true. Maybe I should really do it.
COOP200734
It might even end up bothering her.
COOP200735
band
COOP200736
kept me going this whole time.
COOP200737
out to me.
COOP200739
thank you for.
COOP200740
I've always found strength in music.
COOP200741
want to keep it in my life.
COOP200742
give me strength back then...
COOP200743
I think I finally get it.
COOP200744
can't to someone's face.
COOP200745
too uncertain or afraid to talk about.
COOP200746
have things like that they want to say.
COOP200747
you for.

COOP210207
from places that remind me of it all
COOP210209
COOP210210
my side.
COOP210211
lost in conversation helps me take a break
from my problems.
COOP210212

COOP210403
COOP210404
sea
lights...
COOP210405
COOP210406

COOP210408
COOP210409
awkward all of a sudden.

demoralized her...
COOP200116

COOP400003
COOP400004
morning thinking about how to invite you.
COOP400005
COOP400006
COOP400010
isn't it?
COOP400011
by this area just about every day.
COOP400012
way to work
much.
COOP400013
something? That'd totally take the wind out
of my sails on a day off...
COOP400014
if that happened. Or find somewhere to drink
near my place...
COOP400015
COOP400016
area...
COOP400017
the day
home.
COOP400018
as much like I'm on my way to work.
COOP400019
Maybe we should hang out here together more
often?
COOP400020
COOP400021
excited too!
COOP400022
love to get to know Shibuya better.
COOP400023
we're in Tokyo
COOP400040
COOP400041
so I know all the bars here.
COOP400042
in
COOP400043
COOP400044
COOP400045
means you'll be able to drink for the next
sixty years of your life!
COOP400046
and stuff while you can
COOP400047
COOP400048
into things.
COOP400049
very much.
COOP400050
mistakes when I'm drunk...
COOP400051
COOP400052
mood that I picked up everyone else's tabs...
COOP400053
morning to find my wallet empty!
COOP400054
COOP400055
COOP400056
COOP400057
than a bar sound?
COOP400058
around here with you!
COOP400070
COOP400071
along
COOP400072
planetarium's not the easiest place to visit
on your own.
COOP400073
COOP400074
cocktail or mocktail themed around stars.
COOP400075
has to look presentable as well.
COOP400076
before you put your lips to the glass.
COOP400077
drink?
COOP400078
COOP400079
COOP400080
right?
COOP400081
cubes or something!
COOP400082
that's for sure.
COOP400083
purple to create a gradient like that.
COOP400084
decoration around the rim to make it cuter
too.
COOP400085
but I didn't expect it to be this much fun!
COOP400086
COOP400087
COOP400088
COOP400089
today... Any constellations you wanna keep an
eye out for?
COOP400100
COOP400101
seem to melt away.
COOP400102
up here
COOP400103
I've ridden this with someone else!
COOP400104
first person to share a gondola with me?
COOP400105
COOP400106
COOP400107
COOP400108
because you're here...
COOP400109
COOP400110
with someone else...
COOP400111
were the one who taught me
COOP400112
COOP400113
from high up again today? Let's do this!
COOP400130
before.
COOP400131
others do it!
COOP400132
COOP400133
to go...
COOP400134
COOP400135
COOP400136
COOP400137
on you!
COOP400138
COOP400139
COOP400140
COOP400141
COOP400142

COOP400147
really hits the spot
COOP400162
really like it!
COOP400163

COOP400164
I'll be giving you something just as good
in return!
COOP400165
COOP400166
COOP400180
COOP400181
Thing is
make at the bar...
COOP400182
so can I make it at your place?
COOP400183
COOP400184
to it...
COOP400185
all we're doing
COOP400187
for you. Whenever you're ready is fine!
COOP400188
COOP400189
COOP400190
an excuse.
COOP400191
Hey, can I come over?
COOP400192
COOP400193
Or give you the wrong idea...
COOP400194
your place looked like..
COOP400195
COOP400196
sure you're younger than me?
COOP400197
in the palm of your hand...
COOP400198
COOP400199
you as well.
COOP400200
country now
COOP400201
alone!?
COOP400202
another time
COOP400203
everything I need for the mocktails.
COOP400204
A nice drink sounds like a good place to
start...
COOP400205
place again today!
COOP400300
COOP400361
Is she a street performer?
COOP400301
COOP400302
finisher!
COOP400303
COOP400305
nearby!
COOP400306
it's only water
COOP400307
COOP400308
walk away like that.
COOP400309
if it was raining
COOP400310
a cold because of me!
COOP400311
towel and hang out until your clothes dry.
COOP400313
didn't get the inside of your bag wet.
COOP400314
Shiina</color>. And you are...?
COOP400315
COOP400316
COOP400317
COOP400318
moves. I work here as a bartender.
COOP400319
My job is to make drinks with them.
COOP400320
COOP400321
while performing like this.
COOP400322
up a mixer
COOP400323
Though I didn't mean for you to get a
firsthand taste of my practice...
COOP400324
apology
*should* look like.
COOP400325
with this
this?
COOP400326
COOP400328
COOP400329
COOP400330
mocktail. It's nonalcoholic.
COOP400331
COOP400332
COOP400333
COOP400334
a sweet tooth then?
COOP400335
together well
COOP400336
water instead of club soda?
COOP400337
bartending?
COOP400338
impression seeing it properly for the first
time.
COOP400339
COOP400340
myself looking composed paid off!
COOP400341
draw inspiration from dance for that.
COOP400342
COOP400343
I guess I did splash water on you...
COOP400344
perfect that trick from earlier someday.
COOP400347
COOP400348
you like.
COOP400349
COOP400350
minors are welcome here.
COOP400351
rules and you can come as often as you'd
like!
COOP400352
but they want to welcome customers who have
to leave out the liquor too.
COOP400353
and nondrinkers can enjoy the atmosphere
here.
COOP400354
be my mocktail taste-tester?
COOP400355
could use a second opinion... Most people
here only order alcohol
COOP400356
recipes for you so you can make them at home!
COOP400357
COOP400359
mocktails for you
COOP400360
show you
COOP400400
{NAME2}-kun.
COOP400401
COOP400402
waiting.
COOP400403
make you today?
COOP400404
COOP400405
COOP400406
gradients like this.
COOP400407
tastes as good as it looks too! ...Probably.
COOP400408
your socials. Make sure the bottle's in the
shot!
COOP400409
The name makes it sound like the real deal
doesn't it?
COOP400410
COOP400411
syrup for the base
ale on top.
COOP400412
It's about as classic a mocktail as they
come.
COOP400413
in the glass. It should be easy for you to
make at home too.
COOP400414
owner here kept saying that when I was new.
COOP400415
COOP400416
COOP400417
back then
day...
COOP400418
and wandered right into a bar.
COOP400419
in front of me
incredible.
COOP400420
itself.
COOP400421
before handing me my drink.
COOP400422
those graceful movements... I was mesmerized
and pretty soon became a regular.
COOP400423
thinking much about my future...
COOP400424
wondering if I could make drinks like that.
COOP400425
started learning! That bartender I saw then
is the owner here.
COOP400426
to make others feel the way I did that day.
COOP400427
embarrassing
COOP400428
COOP400429
COOP400431
something a little different.
COOP400460
always do!
COOP400461
COOP400462
COOP400463
COOP400464
You're the best
COOP400465
COOP400466
she's really dancing back there!
COOP400467
elegant. She's mesmerizing.
COOP400468
COOP400469
anywhere with me
COOP400470
COOP400471
after this. Maybe next time!
COOP400472
 saw some flair
something else.
COOP400473
time you came by.
COOP400474
COOP400475
little step to the sequence there.
COOP400476
footwork opens up so many possibilities.
COOP400477
COOP400478
COOP400479
elements into my flair.
COOP400480

COOP400482
with my club. Here I am.
COOP400484
was a belly dancing competition.
COOP400485

COOP400486
COOP400487
much practice to make them look good.
COOP400488
myself to accent the green shades of the
dress.
COOP400489
want to ruin the mood by smiling.
COOP400490
too. It's been a while since I've even shown
this to anyone.
COOP400491
COOP400493
you keep in shape
fun.
COOP400494
It was all I could think about back then...
COOP400495
COOP400496
drone on and on about myself.
COOP400497
COOP400498
do you want? Anything's on the menu for
today!
COOP400499
best place to start.
COOP400500
a little of that
COOP400520
COOP400521
COOP400522
COOP400523
COOP400524
COOP400525
other supplies took the day off.
COOP400526
today
COOP400527

COOP400529
for me?
COOP400530
helping out
COOP400531
arms were about to fall off.
COOP400532
COOP400533
are pretty strong...
COOP400534
the way here.
COOP400535
and then
COOP400536
thanks for the help.
COOP400537
peach tea.
COOP400538
COOP400539
non-alcoholic
COOP400540
even got some garnishing like cocktails do!
COOP400541
after working up a sweat. Come on
COOP400542
your alley
COOP400543
COOP400544
stir! Yup! It's that easy!
COOP400545
the base to make it more like a cocktail.
COOP400546
glass. Layers really do help make a drink
pop.
COOP400547
pick-me-up when I'm tired
little sweeter.
COOP400548
the flavor up with some jasmine tea.
COOP400549
black tea as another variation.
COOP400550
own takes on the recipe
COOP400552
COOP400553
I could make you some pasta with those
groceries we carried here.
COOP400555

Yumi-chan! I could watch you bartend for
like

COOP400580
watching a show. It's not just me
COOP400581
dancer.
COOP400582
stage!
COOP400583

COOP400584
COOP400586
COOP400587
COOP400588
other day at home?
COOP400589
COOP400590
COOP400591
another recipe for you.
COOP400592

tough!
COOP400593

COOP400594
making it here for me?
COOP400595
COOP400598
COOP400599
of it!
COOP400600
Still
COOP400601
COOP400602
COOP400603
different. Did you use a new base?
COOP400604
COOP400605
COOP400606
COOP400607
good for that.
COOP400608
COOP400609
person. That makes me happy.
COOP400610
together a drink to lift my mood?
COOP400611
kid! Just kidding.
COOP400612
COOP400614
tells me that I've still got ways to go as a
bartender.
COOP400615
that I could become a dancer.
COOP400616
though I was the one who gave up on dancing.
COOP400617
COOP400618
didn't want to keep going.
COOP400619
I could've kept on dancing as a hobby.
COOP400620
I was in dance
COOP400621
doing what I liked
COOP400622
COOP400623
I know I'm being a drag.
COOP400624
Okay
COOP400640
COOP400641
COOP400642
COOP400643
COOP400644
COOP400646
it's more like a gathering for flair
bartenders?
COOP400647
original cocktails.
COOP400648
pretty big bar for a while.
COOP400649
COOP400650
COOP400651
loads of better bartenders out there.

COOP400653

streamed?
COOP400654
enter this or anything...
COOP400655
from me
COOP400656
COOP400657
bartending and coming up with recipes
COOP400658
COOP400659
dancing
COOP400660
anything back then. I just wanted to have fun
and make friends.
COOP400661
think that's why I could keep at it.
COOP400662
a "let's enjoy dance" vibe than anything.
COOP400663
about winning or losing.
COOP400664
show off what we could do.
COOP400665
worked our butts off to perfect our moves.
COOP400666
COOP400667
in the audience complained about me.
COOP400668
competition
his top.
COOP400669
it seriously
the same mistakes.
COOP400670
I was just dancing for fun.
COOP400671
He kept coming to events to criticize me.
COOP400672
then whined when I let him down. I couldn't
stand it.
COOP400673
for me.
COOP400675
wanted to drink my worries away... and ended
up here.
COOP400676
bartending.
COOP400677
COOP400678
heavy tangent...
COOP400679
competing isn't really my thing.
COOP400680
they judge me. So maybe this tournament isn't
for me.
COOP400681
COOP400682
COOP400683
it's not that serious anyway.
COOP400684
better.
COOP400685
told all that to. Wow
embarrassing!
COOP400687
thanks for today.
COOP400700
COOP400701
COOP400702
when you're free.
COOP400703
Hope you'll try this one out yourself.
COOP400704
COOP400705
COOP400706
COOP400707
COOP400708
told that you're banned from this store.
COOP400709

The customer always comes first!
COOP400711
COOP400712
COOP400713
COOP400714
COOP400715
it turn into a soda fountain for kids?

better cocktails. It was awful.
COOP400726
I thought he wouldn't come back...
COOP400727
and now I'm talking to you about my life
story again.
COOP400728
ready to snap at any moment.
COOP400729
COOP400730
I feel a lot better now.
COOP400731
terrified.
COOP400732
that didn't do a lick of good.
COOP400733
anything on my own.
COOP400734

COOP50817
COOP50820
COOP50821

COOP50883
who can hit the most home runs.
COOP50884
if you lose
the women's pro league.
COOP50885
COOP50886
from that machine. Whoever gets more
homers wins.
COOP50887
Let me know when you think you're ready to
take me on!
COOP50888
Motoha Arai!
COOP50889
COOP50890
COOP50891
COOP50892
really beat her!?
COOP50894
feel like I can!
COOP50895
I can hit a home run!
COOP50896
all-rounder? Am I pitching and batting!?
COOP50897

COOP50898
So to do that...

COOP51001
COOP51003
COOP51004
you to it.
COOP51005
COOP51006
selfish.
COOP51008
COOP51009
stronger as a Phantom Thief
take on Tamayo.
COOP51010
pissed.
COOP51011
and stuff.
COOP51013
COOP51014
at the batting cages. I won't lose to Tamayo!
COOP51017
COOP51018
losing to you!
COOP51019
COOP51020
COOP51021
COOP51022

COOP51023
swinging practice like this was how I
improved.
COOP51024
in no time!
COOP51026
able to hit Kiuchi's pitch at his Palace.
COOP51027
Don't you think
COOP51029

COOP51030

COOP51031
Maybe not though
COOP51032
COOP51033
COOP51034
COOP51035
we're talkin'!
COOP51036
COOP51037
angle the bat like this...
COOP51038
COOP51041
COOP51042
COOP51043
COOP51044
COOP51046
should I eat on the way home?
COOP51047
COOP51200
batting cages?
COOP51201
COOP51203
COOP51204
you to it.
COOP51205
COOP51206
COOP51209
COOP51211
right?
COOP51213
COOP51214
If you wanna talk
COOP51215
my idol.
COOP51216
from a young age.
COOP51217
them. I even cheered them on at nationals.
COOP51218
baseball too
legend that was Motoha Arai.
COOP51219
lost miserably. That girl was Motoha Arai.
COOP51221
my brother's team and waited for a match
against her.
COOP51222
learned what a true prodigy looks like!
COOP51223
as her
future like my brothers.
COOP51224
strived to get stronger.
COOP51225
COOP51226
from baseball.
COOP51227
I wanted to be on the same pro team with her
some day.
COOP51229
when she jumped ship.
COOP51230
both of us!
COOP51231
and decided I wanted to become a pro women's
baseball player no matter what!
COOP51232
thick skin to be taken seriously in the
male-dominated sports world.
COOP51233
women's pro league on my own.
COOP51234
out. But now...!
COOP51235
there's still hope!
COOP51236
COOP51237
baseball
COOP51238
girl will always have a place on the field!
COOP51242
outright
baseball has changed!
COOP51243
back then.
COOP51245
Motoha Arai's coach?
COOP51247
actually end up being.
COOP51248
I'm leaving Motoha Arai's coaching to a jerk
like you.
COOP51249
COOP51250
I'm not backing down.
COOP51251
COOP51252
she has to do is hit some home runs.
COOP51253
ready! Until then
COOP51254
COOP51257
COOP51258
COOP51262
then practice some more.
COOP51264
one more time!
COOP51265
runs
COOP51400

COOP51408
COOP51409
COOP51410
COOP51411
COOP51413
COOP51414
such a wreck...
COOP51416
COOP51417
COOP51418
COOP51419
hard to catch up to her!
COOP51421
COOP51422
COOP51424
COOP51426
COOP51428
COOP51429
using this time to get ahead of me!
COOP51431
COOP51432
started getting in shape...
COOP51433
everyone who's lost their desires like I did.
COOP51434
COOP51436
COOP51437
it. The truth is I've been dying to practice
again!
COOP51438
for quitting doesn't exist anymore.
COOP51439
want baseball in my life again.
COOP51440
COOP51441
Phantom Thieves. That's how I really feel.
COOP51442
like this.
COOP51443
stolen from them
that so I can toss a ball on a field?
COOP51444
COOP51445
anymore
COOP51446
Phantom Thief!
COOP51447
the sport I love
happy future too!
COOP51449
COOP51450
till now.
COOP51451
realized without your help
COOP51453
COOP51454
COOP51455
focused on beating Tamayo that I couldn't
think straight.
COOP51456
what to do.
COOP51457
a steak
COOP51458
COOP51459
COOP51460
coach.
COOP51461
overworking myself non-stop.
COOP51462
forgot how much I need to take breaks
from it.
COOP51463
COOP51464
way I can beat Tamayo.
COOP51465
despite that...
COOP51466
this all for me?
COOP51469
say we're a team...
COOP51470
teammates. Hmm
COOP51471
the team!
COOP51474
hungry! I think it's time we invite some
caramel parfait to this party!
COOP51475
COOP51477
COOP51478
by that!?
COOP51480
COOP51481
COOP51482
COOP51483
COOP51487
another parfait!
COOP51488
COOP51600
challenge with Tamayo.
COOP51601
COOP51602
COOP51604
COOP51605
you to it.
COOP51606
know when you're around.
COOP51607
COOP51608
be the one apologizing.
COOP51609
pitches
wins.
COOP51610
COOP51611
apologize sincerely to your coach. Sound
good?
COOP51612
COOP51613
COOP51614
out here. Too bad I'm about to knock that
confidence right outta the park.
COOP51615
COOP51616
COOP51617
COOP51618
COOP51619
three home runs.
COOP51620
you say?
COOP51621
COOP51622
COOP51624
COOP51625
COOP51626
COOP51627
COOP51628
because you thought you could win!?
COOP51629
COOP51630
same person I was back then.
COOP51631
practice after quitting the game for so long.
COOP51632
COOP51633
I'm not ready just yet.
COOP51634
practice a hell of a lot more.
COOP51635
for now
COOP51636
COOP51637
COOP51638
But it'd be best for the both of us if
I wait.
COOP51639
as a baseball player.
COOP51640
playing like you one day...
COOP51641
COOP51642
COOP51643
tried
I still came to face you.
COOP51644
COOP51645
this?
COOP51647
COOP51648
lose...
COOP51649
then. I remember now...
COOP51650
COOP51651
humoring me.
COOP51652
and jumped on board with the competition.
COOP51653
waiting for your comeback.
COOP51654
alongside you
COOP51655
your skills!
COOP51656
all
COOP51657
COOP51658
COOP51660
COOP51661
me
COOP51662
called cool!
COOP51663
to me in little league! I didn't think I'd get
to hear it again.
COOP51664
COOP51665
wouldn't have any regrets.
COOP51666
soon... But I'm gonna work my butt off to get
there!
COOP51667
COOP51669
first! I wanna be able to throw myself back
into baseball at full strength.
COOP51671
COOP51672
a base and the bad guys' hearts
COOP51673
COOP51674
But it's not my cheat day
parfait!
COOP51675
COOP51677
COOP51678
COOP51679
And you'll be there for me through it all
right?
COOP51680
COOP51681
COOP51800
me somewhere...
COOP51801
COOP51802
COOP51804
COOP51848
COOP51805
you to it.
COOP51806
COOP51807
COOP51808
I was in little league.
COOP51809
We lost!
COOP51810
there to grab ice cream before going home.
COOP51811
lost to Tamayo the other day.
COOP51812
losing this time compared to back then. It's
almost like I'm over it.
COOP51813
of my coach. You
COOP51814
the training and the contest with Tamayo.
COOP51816
Ahaha...
COOP51817
the world. Like if you lose a tournament
that's it
COOP51818
the end.
COOP51819
from this defeat.
COOP51820
lose.
COOP51821
faced Tamayo.
COOP51822
could never jump over...
COOP51823
people's desires would've been stolen
from them.
COOP51824
can't afford to lose.
COOP51825
play catch with Tomoko too...
COOP51826
I'll keep working hard from here on out!
COOP51828
COOP51829
COOP51831
COOP51832
COOP51833
COOP51834
COOP51835
COOP51836
get some ice cream before we go?
COOP51837
scoop! Oh
COOP51839
COOP51840
COOP51841
otherwise...
COOP51842
COOP51843
get some ice cream before we go?
COOP51844
COOP51845
Is that okay?
COOP51846
COOP58001
COOP58002
something.
COOP58004
COOP58006
COOP58010
training in the sand before?
COOP58011
backwards. You'll just get sand everywhere.
COOP58012
thighs to get the next step in.
COOP58013
COOP58015
that yet.
COOP58016
now's the right time to get stuck in.
COOP58017
COOP58018
effortlessly.
COOP58019
with my form.
COOP58020
making progress or not.
COOP58021
speed on the beach.
COOP58022
anything.
COOP58023
COOP58024
give it our all!
COOP58040
training but...
COOP58041
space.
COOP58042
corner of the gym?
COOP58043
should I do...?
COOP58045
No pain
COOP58046
COOP58047
good for toning up. Apparently they help with
your posture
COOP58048
COOP58049
do alone!
COOP58050
COOP58051
teams is kind of a good thing.
COOP58052
all those wandering eyes...
COOP58053
me to pull myself together.
COOP58054
COOP58055
to it!
COOP58070
feels like a workout.
COOP58071
drink.
COOP58072
COOP58073
sorts of flavors to enjoy your protein.
COOP58074
though. What flavor would you recommend
{NAME2}?
COOP58076
like hot chocolate if I mix it with milk?
COOP58077
That's bound to make you feel refreshed.
COOP58078
Sounds a li'l adventurous for my taste.
COOP58079
give it a try.
COOP58080
shake for you too
COOP58081
walking again.
COOP58082
definitely won't help me tone up. Gotta
refrain!
COOP58083
flavored protein shakes!
COOP58084
shape but still crave sweet treats!
COOP58085
flavored shake... Or better yet
parfait one!
COOP58086
of things you can do.
COOP58100
reflexes other than the batting cages.
COOP58101
COOP58102
I've always wanted to try.
COOP58104
right?
COOP58105
COOP58106
birds with one stone!
COOP58107
also double up as training?
COOP58108
score to measure progress.
COOP58109
my observational skills.
COOP58110
I should just have fun.
COOP58111
gotta let go!
COOP58112
COOP58113
available!
COOP58131
just what I need after a hunger-inducing
workout!

COOP58134
athlete once recommended it in a magazine.
COOP58135
COOP58136
high in carbs.
COOP58138
anyway. A little extra won't cause too much
damage.
COOP58139
carbs.
COOP58140
recommendation. Let's order!
COOP58141
order just cause I am.
COOP58142
single topping...
COOP58143
while you eat!
COOP58144
COOP58145

COOP58162

COOP58164
COOP58165
there! If you really don't mind
COOP58167

So you've got the place to yourself.

COOP59989
COOP59990
it's like my primal instincts are telling me
to stay away...
COOP59993

COOP59995

COOP59996
COOP59997
of this!
COOP60000

COOP60003
prefer you introduce yourself first
COOP60004
must be an upperclassman. Fine then.
COOP60005
freshman class.
COOP60007
There's no need for that. Let me offer
respect where it is due.
COOP60008
{NAME1}-san. Yes
COOP60009
COOP60010
{NAME1}-san...
COOP60011
means you've come to see me
COOP60013
remember?
COOP60014
inevitable result of our respective
circumstances.
COOP60015
pushed

A chosen one

COOP60018
this school's hallowed halls
COOP60020
COOP60021
protect our school.
COOP60023
COOP60024
I researched my suspicions day and night
until I discovered the truth.
COOP60025
phenomena of all kinds!
COOP60026
I don't care for that sort of thing.
COOP60027
determining their cause
occurrences haunt the mind
COOP60029
the same page.
COOP60030
my main point.
COOP60031
school will fall prey to the forces of
darkness.
COOP60032

the innocent.

COOP60040
COOP60042
We're kindred spirits
COOP60043
Everyday life just gets so boring
doesn't it?
COOP60045
know. I understand! And I know how painful
it is...
COOP60046
threatening to devour it
boredom plaguing us gifted individuals—
COOP60047
stand to lose anything... I think.
COOP60050
some of my favorite books!
COOP60051
buy anymore. I've got a lot like that.
COOP60052
and let us do whatever it takes to protect
this school!
COOP60054
COOP60057
let's trade contact info just in case.
COOP60058
COOP60059
I'll continue on with my research of the
paranormal.
COOP60060
it... proof of our resolve and a memento of
our fated meeting.
COOP60062
COOP60063
things out together!
COOP60200
are naturally drawn together after all.
COOP60201
mysterious incidents
face it. Are you?
COOP60203
I thought so.
COOP60204
Harrowed Grounds.
COOP60206
not already too late!
COOP60207
COOP60208
to attend to as well. Let's look into it
next time.
COOP60209
Grounds.
COOP60210
I was finally able to confirm its location.
COOP60211
To think it's already progressed this far!
COOP60213
means his sinister corpse will soon arise!
COOP60215
a great demon that had brought ruin to the
world.
COOP60216
Therefore
COOP60217
forced to... c-call the police?
COOP60219
spot! No matter what!
COOP60221
controlled by the demon!?
COOP60222
COOP60223
take you too!
COOP60224
COOP60225
better steer clear if you like having clean
shoes.
COOP60226
COOP60227
The grass even stopped growing after a while!
COOP60228
COOP60229
here
right? Ah well.
COOP60231
COOP60232
COOP60233

COOP60234
one of the school's terrifyingly threatening
mysteries...
COOP60235
poop is threatening in its own way...
COOP60236
have uncovered the truth together.
COOP60237
COOP60239
some secret organization.
COOP60240
hide the truth about the demon's sinister
corpse!
COOP60242
who's shown us such kindness.
COOP60243
after all.
COOP60244
COOP60400

I expected as much.

Hall of Lament.
COOP60406
remember to keep your wits about you.
COOP60407
you in on the details there.

another time.
COOP60410
COOP60411
wailing can be heard here after school.
COOP60412
great misfortune.
COOP60413
been any recent victims. But we can't leave
this problem to fester.
COOP60414
here. Before it claims another victim
we must...
COOP60416
with
COOP60417
seem to come back even after the case is
solved?
COOP60418
like this.
COOP60419
COOP60420
COOP60421
COOP60422
We've been detected by the enemy!
COOP60423

misfortune.

COOP60444

COOP60445

COOP60446
COOP60448
I think it's going to haunt my dreams...
COOP60449
COOP60451

COOP60608

COOP60609
the school shop.
COOP60610
students have actually laid eyes on it.
COOP60612
actually drinking it is bound to draw
attention.
COOP60613
more to the story.

COOP60623
The restock must be in progress.

It's juice
COOP60643
have this juice!
COOP60644
you could possibly drink it all alone.
COOP60645
COOP60646
stopping you.
COOP60647
COOP60649
school sometimes requires swift judgments
like this.
COOP60650
We aren't nearly finished yet.
COOP60651
we know Take is the one buying it up
I believe murder is less likely.
COOP60652
it to school every day. But now we have a new
problem.
COOP60654
Take-kun isn't the type to make bold moves...

COOP60671
COOP60800
ones truly are in sync.
COOP60801
yes? One of the mysteries threatening our
school?
COOP60802
I'm ready to pursue this mystery. How
about you?
COOP60804
as much.
COOP60805
sure to be there too.
COOP60806
COOP60807
investigate next time.
COOP60808
and it's clear Take isn't drinking that
juice.
COOP60809
COOP60811
juice. I don't know who it is
COOP60812
when he... Hm? Oh
COOP60813

COOP60850
COOP60851
COOP60852
COOP60853
COOP60854

COOP60857
COOP60858
COOP60859
COOP60860
COOP60861
COOP60862
COOP60863
Let's get outta here!
COOP60864
COOP60865
COOP60866
COOP60867
COOP60868
Assassin's Juice is solved!
COOP60870
glorious?
COOP60871
COOP60872
there to back me up
COOP60873
This was our victory.
COOP60875
Take-kun is still under threat.
COOP60876
my duty here has yet to be fulfilled.
COOP60877
to rest and recover my power... So...
tired...
COOP68500
so I'm going to have to survey the area.
COOP68501
you come?
COOP68503
investigate.
COOP68505
available.
COOP68506
here radiate with the aura of the sun.
COOP68507
chosen ones
darkness from the shadows...
COOP68509
COOP68510
second there.
COOP68511
were comrades.
COOP68512
As a warrior of the dark
ally of the light.
COOP68513
what intel we can gather from the young
people here.
COOP68514
be related to the threat.
COOP68515
café by the station?
COOP68516
COOP68517
COOP68518
COOP68519
unsuspecting youths. A new threat!
COOP68520
We should go to this café at once!
COOP68522
say. We ought to feign naivety and just play
along.
COOP68523
the purpose of investigation.
COOP68524
iron is hot. Let's follow those two!
COOP68531
Let's tread carefully while we investigate...
COOP68532
modern-day Tower of Babel.
COOP68533
the wrath of the gods
COOP68534
I wonder if I can see my house?
COOP68535
COOP68536
excited.
COOP68537
{NAME1}-san? Which side would it be?
COOP68538
buildings in the world
COOP68539
efforts on the largest first. In the
meantime
COOP68541
here as I expected.
COOP68542
their significant other. Do you think we look
out of place?
COOP68543
COOP68544
all... Our bond is stronger than any
couple's.
COOP68545
right? Very funny
COOP68546
COOP68547
drop by the gift shop on our way out?
COOP68548
they sell one for this place?
COOP68555
be described as "threat central." Nothing but
nasties as far as the eye can see!
COOP68556
The scent of a threat is thick in the air.
COOP68557
COOP68558
before we find the real threat.
COOP68559
COOP68560
could be stripped of all we have.
COOP68561
just call the cops
COOP68562
then?
COOP68563
you! Especially today it seems.
COOP68564
that sells highly specialized books.
COOP68565
when it comes to reading material
caught my interest.
COOP68566
we could uncover information on the threat?
COOP68567
classics
COOP68568
enticed by the darkness of temptation...
COOP68569
keep our survey within the bounds of the law.
COOP68576
gives me the creeps.
COOP68577
know there was a park like this too.
COOP68578
like fun...
COOP68579
play around.
COOP68580
Now
visitors.
COOP68581
COOP68582
a survey of the entire park is highly
warranted.
COOP68583
rides ourselves!
COOP68584
COOP68585
you. Us kindred spirits must always stick
together.
COOP68586
should get a park pass?
COOP68587
COOP68588
mission depends on it. Really.
COOP68589
And... I have also been curious to try
it out!
COOP68590
itself. Let's start from that ride over
there!
COOP68597
surprised if we found a dangerous spirit
lurking between its steel walls...
COOP68598
the talk of the school lately...
COOP68599
on other customers.
COOP68600
information. What do you say?
COOP68601
COOP68602
perks—uh
COOP68603
investigate
COOP68604
your ears open in the queue!
COOP68605
What a beautiful clear soup!
COOP68606
crunchy texture really stands out.
COOP68607
with
reason being...
COOP68609
soft! Let's dig in
COOP68616
Do we follow the beaten path or try something
new? That is the question.
COOP68619
to a T!
COOP68620
can see right through me.
COOP68621
such a kind offer? 
COOP68622
COOP68623
It means a lot.
COOP70007
COOP70008
COOP70009
COOP70011
COOP70012
holdings... There's nothing quite like it.
COOP70013
you've cleared it for farming... It's
irresistible!
COOP70014
land!
COOP70016
COOP70017
COOP70018
COOP70019
COOP70020
acquaintance.
COOP61000
chosen ones just can't be kept apart
can they?
COOP61001
today
COOP61003
as expected.
COOP61004
COOP61005
COOP61006
moment... Let's look into it later.
COOP61007
nowadays.
COOP61008
close at hand after all.
COOP61009
comes here...
COOP61011
to shut off the lights.
COOP61012
inside.
COOP61013
back then.
COOP61014
and eventually she starved to death.
COOP61015
where we stand now.
COOP61017
However...
COOP61018
COOP61019
can't hide such things from a kindred spirit.
COOP61020
female student in my shoe locker.
COOP61021
today after classes.
COOP61022
before
COOP61023
present for this
COOP61025
on the uptake.
COOP61026
in that locker over there
COOP61027
COOP61028
COOP61030
COOP61031
COOP61032
COOP61034
of the chosen ones I must maintain composure!
COOP61035
concoct a plan to escape this predicament!
COOP61036
identities and laid a trap for us!?
COOP61037
two of us have the power to overcome any
trial.
COOP61038
COOP61039
COOP61040
curse of the Evil AV Room!
COOP61042
again! Let's get out of this place
immediately!
COOP61043
COOP61044
COOP61045
slip from the Evil AV Room's cursed grasp.
COOP61046
take it.
COOP61048
slipped from my grasp...
COOP61200
but it seems fate has drawn us chosen ones
together.
COOP61201
today
COOP61203
that's what I thought you'd say.
COOP61204
AV Room... We need to ask him why he did that
to us
COOP61205
avoiding me ever since the incident.
COOP61206
COOP61207
COOP61208
this another time.
COOP61209
COOP61210
COOP61211
COOP61212
Kurotani-kun and take a video of it.
COOP61213
COOP61214
school.
COOP61215
them lately
COOP61216
blow off steam
good guys they used to be.
COOP61218
we agree.
COOP61219
to sacrifice yourself for them?
COOP61220
them
from where we were standing.
COOP61221
COOP61222
to get worse for you. Are you okay with that?
COOP61223
COOP61224
we cannot let this go on. Agreed?
COOP61226
{NAME1}-san.
COOP61227
However!
COOP61228
COOP61229
is made manifest!
COOP61230
COOP61635
COOP61636
COOP61637
COOP61638
COOP61639
COOP61640
COOP61641
hard for you guys
COOP61643
COOP61645
COOP61646
COOP61647
COOP61648
COOP61649
COOP61650
COOP61651
COOP61652
COOP61654
COOP61655
COOP61800
to tell you about the Take-kun situation...
COOP61802
I figured you'd say that.
COOP61803
COOP61804
COOP61805
so let's talk another time...
COOP61806
COOP61807
COOP61808
after that.
COOP61809
he can speak his mind to them again.
COOP61810
fruit.
COOP61812
could have managed this alone.
COOP61813
stand up for himself from now on.
COOP61814
that against them?
COOP61815
things after he saw the way you looked out
for me.
COOP61816
treatment from his friends anymore. So that's
a relief.
COOP61817
understand friendship...
COOP61818
all of this.
COOP61820
friend.
COOP61821
COOP61822
means to be someone's friend.
COOP61823
the side-lines
COOP61824
like Take-kun did. Both are true signs of
friendship.
COOP61825
friends in the end.
COOP61826
depend on the way you treat the other person.
COOP61827
you
COOP61829
friends with me.
COOP61830
and urban legends against the universe
anymore.
COOP61831
for me.
COOP61832
give you this rare book.
COOP61834
investigations together. Is that all right
with you
COOP61835
COOP61836
spirits reunited from our past lives!
COOP70241
COOP70242
COOP70245
COOP70246
scares me a little
COOP70247
it's fine.
COOP70248
COOP70427
scares me a little
COOP70808
COOP70810
COOP70811
must be...
COOP70812
COOP70813
real life as well. I'm glad you took to it.
COOP70814
COOP70815
as you?
COOP70816
have come.
COOP70817
COOP70818
COOP70819

COOP70833

COOP70834
lunch break and here I am.
COOP70835
large hamburger and fries.
COOP70836

COOP70841
magnificent farm.
COOP70842

COOP70843
hour by bus to get there.
COOP70844
terms of finding a job
to the city or become a farmer.
COOP70845
their creepy crawly little legs.
COOP70846
COOP70847
that I don't even have time to eat.
COOP70848
my parents' place wouldn't be so bad.
COOP70849
envious.
COOP70850
growing crops with you.
COOP70851
I hope you'll continue to be friends
with her.
COOP70852
COOP70854
COOP70855
COOP70856
COOP70858
COOP70859

COOP71410
COOP71605
I'd invite you out.
COOP71606
you some coffee.
COOP71607
there.
COOP71608
for a while?
COOP71609
COOP71610
I practically lived at the office.
COOP71611
made a mistake and then disappeared into
thin air.
COOP71612
COOP71613
everything.
COOP71614
trouble to deal with on our farm as well.
COOP71615
COOP71616
COOP71617
for me.
COOP71618
whining about how bad I have it.
COOP71619
COOP71620
my power to fix things for myself!
COOP71621
I was buried under.
COOP71622
I want to thank you.
COOP71623
important to me.
COOP71624
been thinking about growing something at
my place.
COOP71625
this. Would you mind coming along and giving
me some advice?
COOP71627
COOP71628
mall. Let's go.
COOP71629
options.
COOP71630
COOP71632
shouldn't get a plant that needs too much
attention to survive.
COOP71633
the morning and afternoon. That's a bit of
a hassle.
COOP71634
plants for you!? Oh
expensive.
COOP71635
of sunlight.
COOP71636
unless there's sunlight coming through the
window.
COOP71637
COOP71638
Don't think we'll get along.
COOP71639
COOP71640
COOP71641
Haha... I can't afford that.
COOP71642
COOP71643
COOP71644
and stuff.
COOP71645
I couldn't have made this choice without you.
COOP71646
healthy.
COOP71648
bugs that... Oh wait
forgot.
COOP71649
important thing!
COOP71650
COOP71651
COOP71652
COOP71653
who's joining the company tomorrow.
COOP71654
good with people.
COOP71655
this basil.
COOP71657
COOP71658
whack since everything got crazy with work.
COOP71659
get back into a healthier rhythm.
COOP71660
COOP71661
accompanying me.
COOP71662
COOP71850
electronic realm separated from reality.
COOP71851
desires that cannot be attained in the
real world.
COOP71852
own desires. There is no harm in giving it
a try.
COOP78110
Harvest World Online?
COOP78111
online today...
COOP78112
plot of land is what keeps you connected in
more ways than you think.
COOP79997
COOP79999
COOP80800
COOP80801
we could check it out together maybe?
COOP80803
COOP80804
today...
COOP80805
COOP80806
the blue.
COOP80807
lot. Sports shops
You know... Haha.
COOP80809
stores I've been to myself.
COOP80810
used to
COOP80811
COOP80812
my own...
COOP80813
COOP80814
kind of lost...
COOP80815
something to show off the product
COOP80816
COOP80818
buy these on the way out.
COOP80819
that in mind!
COOP80820
I have enough for both...
COOP80821
COOP80822
you here
COOP80823
COOP80824
I was in some sort of weird dream.
COOP80825
realize you're in it.
COOP80826
shop? Shouldn't I be on the field?"
COOP80827
panicked.
COOP80828
COOP80829
even awake or not.
COOP80830
feel like...
COOP80831
had all been a dream.
COOP80832
had I gone through it by myself.
COOP80833
COOP80834
COOP80835
unreal anymore. So
COOP80836
{NAME1}-kun.
COOP80838
COOP80839
COOP80840
going like this
COOP80841
over social media for a while?
COOP80842
COOP80843
that fell off the face of the earth.
COOP80844
COOP80845
Even I heard about that. It was everywhere.
COOP80846
wouldn't suit me at all.
COOP80847
COOP80848
recover completely with rehabilitation.
COOP80849
she could.
COOP80851
worries onto her
COOP80852
COOP80853
just get in the way.
COOP80854
her some support.
COOP80855
being unable to return to what you love....
COOP80856
lot
COOP80857
would you mind coming to work with me again
sometime?
COOP80859
on our work.
COOP80860
COOP81000
COOP81001
thought we could go check it out.
COOP81003
working at a flower shop!
COOP81004
so suddenly.
COOP81005
than one might think.
COOP81006
know. Back in kindergarten.
COOP81007
about it. I was a greedy little gremlin
COOP81008
than what I imagined as a kid.
COOP81009
with these beautiful bouquets of flowers...
COOP81010
a ton! And making bouquets is exhausting.
COOP81011
labor like this. Reminds me of my baseball
training.
COOP81013
COOP81014
for some good rehab.
COOP81015
I'd better put my back into it
COOP81016
COOP81017
COOP81018
working here today?
COOP81019
florists! What can we do for you?
COOP81020
I'd like to make a bouquet out of some.
COOP81021
but not much
COOP81022
Just to give us an idea.
COOP81023
COOP81024
need it by?
COOP81025
COOP81026
COOP81027
I shouldn't have made such a big request
so suddenly...
COOP81028
today
COOP81029
Okay
COOP81030
wrong. So I'd really like to offer the
bouquet today if I can.
COOP81031
have. Then I'll try filling out the bouquet
at other shops.
COOP81032
COOP81033
COOP81034
help her out with those chamomiles somehow?
COOP81035
really want to help her. We have to do
something...
COOP81037
COOP81038
still be enough time to pull it off.
COOP81039
We've got this!
COOP81040
we'll make it happen!
COOP81041
you
COOP81042
chamomile in stock!
COOP81043
in stock
COOP81044
If we call them now
COOP81045
COOP81047
chamomile bouquet!
COOP81048
COOP81049
COOP81050
how we got all the flowers...
COOP81051
impressed!
COOP81052
about!
COOP81053
I hope to see you again!
COOP81054
COOP81055
COOP81057
greatly.
COOP81058
smile on her face.
COOP81059
COOP81060
COOP81062
COOP81063
best by these blooms until then!
COOP81200
today?
COOP81201
was wondering if you'd like to join me.
COOP81203
COOP81204
invitation.
COOP81205
lately.
COOP81206
backup.
COOP81208
COOP81209
feel a lot more at ease.
COOP81210
Spaghetti"? Today's the last day for this
limited-time special!
COOP81211
time on this job
COOP81212
COOP81213
anything!
COOP81214
that and then end up needing your help.
COOP81215
COOP81216
shifts.
COOP81217
COOP81218
the day. Pleased to meet you!
COOP81219
youth grand!
COOP81220
to you!
COOP81221
COOP81223
COOP81224
today.
COOP81225
COOP81226
COOP81227
{NAME1}-kun?
COOP81228
could stop somewhere on the way home...
COOP81229
COOP81230
COOP81231
COOP81233
COOP81234
sooner.
COOP81235
We were on the floor until a minute ago.
COOP81236
the pair of you in action.
COOP81237
COOP81238
a shame. If only I had come earlier.
COOP81239
pasta is really delicious.
COOP81240
Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy Spaghetti!?
COOP81241
I thought I'd like to try it at least once...
COOP81242
quantity. It must be very high in calories.
COOP81243
feeds a table of three.
COOP81244
it a try too anyway!
COOP81245
COOP81246
three of us could pack it away no problem!
COOP81247
like this...
COOP81249
If it's all right with you
COOP81250
we don't eat it now
COOP81251
if you are
COOP81252
the way.
COOP81253
Spaghetti
COOP81254
COOP81255
added a little extra for you.
COOP81256
COOP81258
Were you able to make up?
COOP81259
your help with that.
COOP81260
of it. She even joked
this'll make."
COOP81261
have you to thank for it.
COOP81262
missed the opportunity to try it without you.
COOP81263
to help you.
COOP81264
COOP81265
Kotone-san.
COOP81266
COOP81267
I mean
COOP81268
you did anything to make me think you need—!
Um
COOP81269
misunderstand!
COOP81270
considerate of me this way. Truly.
COOP81271
COOP81272
COOP81273
COOP81274
I'm being driven into a corner.
COOP81275
COOP81276
COOP81278
COOP81279
mentally. Trust me
COOP81280
COOP81281
COOP81282
out of nowhere!
COOP81283
well
COOP81284
COOP81285
you won't spread it around
COOP81286
would you want to hang out maybe!?
COOP81287
COOP81288
COOP81289
would like the chance to repay your kindness.
So by all means
COOP81291
better start thinking of places for us to go
together.
COOP81292
COOP81293
COOP81400
COOP81401
hang out... Think you could join us?
COOP81403
COOP81404
we'll reschedule.
COOP81405
outside of work. Kind of weird
{NAME1}-kun?
COOP81406
COOP81408
COOP81409
together
COOP81410
COOP81411
meet up on a day like this.
COOP81412
Kotone-san and I have been messaging a lot.
COOP81413
what shops she goes to
bakery!
COOP81414
a totally normal person!
COOP81415
rehab. And I'm not even sure how to ask.
COOP81416
that's her...
COOP81417
COOP81418
were you...?
COOP81419
something on my mind is all.
COOP81420
any chance? My treat! As thanks for that
pasta.
COOP81422
COOP81423
COOP81424
the offer with grace!
COOP81425
when I tried to decline your pasta proposal?
COOP81426
stand on ceremony. Let's have fun.
COOP81429
you out so late!
COOP81430
this. My docket for tomorrow is mostly empty
as well.
COOP81431
I feel so much lighter now.
COOP81432
another one! I'll rush right over.
COOP81433
anything
COOP81434
through my injury. {NAME1}-kun
family. So if I can be there for you...
COOP81435
there's any way I can help you return to
yours
COOP81436
COOP81437
be nosing into your business...
COOP81438
COOP81439
truth
COOP81440
and yet...
COOP81441
Your fans will understand!
COOP81442
patiently for you to grace the rink again!
COOP81443
COOP81444
COOP81445
through it
COOP81446
COOP81447
COOP81448
a long time ago...
COOP81449
COOP81451
COOP81452
the time we met.
COOP81453
It's just... I couldn't.
COOP81454
to shake... and my mind goes white...
COOP81455
COOP81456
about me online in the time leading up to
competitions...
COOP81457
commonplace in the figure skating world.
COOP81458
of my heart. Then during rehab
getting to me.
COOP81459
first place?
COOP81460
pain and suffering in rehabilitation?
COOP81461
COOP81462
The problem is my heart.
COOP81463
relaxes me so. You're just so sincere...
COOP81464
COOP81465
this again sometime.
COOP81467
today?
COOP81468
I can't leave her like this.
COOP81469
know it won't be easy.
COOP81470
skating for good
COOP81471
COOP81472
found out I'd never play baseball again.
COOP81473
you by my side.
COOP81474
with me
COOP81475
COOP81477
COOP81479
always been there for me.
COOP81480
COOP81481
thanks to you.
COOP81482
I know that. It's just...
COOP81483
nice if we could stay together like this.
COOP81485
Please
COOP81487
COOP81488
COOP81489
home. Now
decisions.
COOP81491
stop relying on you
COOP81493
COOP81494
COOP81495
COOP81496
Wait
COOP81497
COOP81498
COOP81499
time! Really
COOP81500
wake up
COOP81501
COOP81502
staying like this forever.
COOP81505
COOP81508
Please
COOP81600
time you're free.
COOP81601
situation with Kotone-san...
COOP81603
COOP81604
working at a bookstore in Shinjuku. Let's
give it our all!
COOP81605
time you're free.
COOP81606
COOP81607
music if my life depended on it.
COOP81608

you about.
COOP81610
COOP81611
COOP81612
COOP81613
hard-working figure skater since childhood.
COOP81614
competitions...
COOP81615
heard about her.
COOP81616
That's what people started calling her.
COOP81617
of course
COOP81618
online. For dumb reasons like
cold
COOP81619
The kind of abuses they slung at her...
COOP81620
all over the internet.
COOP81621
comments were even convicted in criminal
court.
COOP81622
Kotone-san's heart.
COOP81624
that out there makes me so mad!
COOP81625
COOP81626
But I am a sleuth with a search engine.
COOP81627
worldwide tournament without batting an eye
and yet she gets treated so horribly.
COOP81628
I can do about this?
COOP81629
affected Kotone-san...
COOP81630
COOP81631
games?
COOP81632
opposing team in front of me...
COOP81633
their fans...
COOP81634
COOP81635
strike out.
COOP81636
that moment
COOP81637
bench. Even though there were people in the
stands who came to support me.
COOP81638
school...
COOP81639
outfield bleachers.
COOP81640
opponent's cheers drowned them out.
COOP81641
all of the people rooting for her out there.
COOP81642
has that
COOP81643
Any ideas
COOP81646
COOP81647
louder?
COOP81648
COOP81649
sometimes.
COOP81650
and stuff.
COOP81651
competition anyway.
COOP81652
cheering us on.
COOP81653
school band. Each batter gets their own
cheer song.
COOP81654
there's no way they can drown out those
tunes.
COOP81655
them with their megaphones going...
COOP81656
COOP81657
anxiety at games anymore...
COOP81658
COOP81659
that is sure to reach her!
COOP81660
We'll prepare a cheer song just for
Kotone-san!
COOP81661
we'll get the pep up planning powwow
underway!
COOP81662
COOP81665
ask you...
COOP81666
right now?
COOP81667
pull the trigger on Kotone-san's cheer song.
COOP81668
little while longer?
COOP81669
big buttinski here
COOP81670
COOP81672
if you're there with me
COOP81673
if you're there with me
COOP81674
make this happen.
COOP81675
COOP81676
the diner by the way. My treat!
COOP81678
powwow... Where do you feel like
{NAME2}-kun?
COOP81700
I wanted to talk to you about Kotone-san's
cheer song.
COOP81701
do you think? Can you make it?
COOP81703
COOP81704
school. Anything should work
sound natural.
COOP81705
meantime
ready.
COOP81706
COOP81707
we'll take her to the roof
performance.
COOP81708
COOP81709
it happens
time you're free!
COOP81710
COOP81711
left is for Kotone-san to show up.
COOP81712
COOP81713
COOP81714
COOP81715
as I could. Why did you want to meet here?
COOP81716
COOP81717
COOP81718
it is.
COOP81720
COOP81721
COOP81722
COOP81723
surprise?
COOP81724
COOP81725
from the sound of it.
COOP81726
trumpets
COOP81727
stadium to cheer on our team.
COOP81728
idea of what a cheer song sounds like.
COOP81729
Koshien.
COOP81730
opposing team were really loud
playing and I'd know...
COOP81731
COOP81732
alone during their routines.
COOP81733
why I wanted you to hear this
COOP81734
there's someone I had to give a cheer no
matter what.
COOP81735
COOP81736
COOP81737
COOP81738
COOP81739
chasse!
COOP81740
COOP81741
them grill me about how I knew you.
COOP81742
it was for you was more then enough to
convince—
COOP81743
COOP81744
COOP81746
COOP81747
COOP81748
for me at bat. Obviously the old version was
a bit diff—
COOP81749
shoddy hand-me-down
COOP81750
COOP81751
COOP81752
competition.
COOP81753
COOP81754
COOP81755
COOP81756
You mean—!?
COOP81757
COOP81758
song will reach me.
COOP81759
it. I'm ready now.
COOP81760
call my coach for a minute? Then I'd like to
meet those brass band friends of yours.
COOP81761
My
COOP81763
wanted to go back most.
COOP81764
excitement
COOP81765
they want a picture together.
COOP81766
COOP81767
skates
COOP81768
COOP81769
COOP81770
coaches!? I'm absolutely serious!
COOP81771
COOP81772
COOP81773
COOP81774
was supposed to do with my life without it.
COOP81775
thought...
COOP81776
COOP81777
COOP81778
just kind of bubble up
COOP81779
a little embarrassing to be honest.
COOP81780
I can offer this world as I am now.
COOP81781
COOP81782
COOP81784
part-time job?
COOP81785
my next dream is right
around the corner.
COOP81786
corner.
COOP81788
COOP81789
anything.
COOP81790
COOP81791
COOP83000
COOP83001
COOP83002
to ask...
COOP83004
COOP83005
actually. I'm kind of embarrassed to ask.
COOP83006
out of the blue.
COOP83007
job. Now that I've quit baseball and all.
COOP83008
nice! It's at a crêpe shop in Shibuya.
COOP83009
coming with me to check it out?
COOP83011
my arm?
COOP83012
mention my arm's kind of...
COOP83013
COOP83014
this. But it doesn't hurt
my daily life at all.
COOP83015
I feel ready or not. So
I thought...
COOP83016
I should be able to handle it. Probably.
COOP83017
I'll be ready in two seconds!
COOP83018
part-timers canceled at the last minute.
COOP83019
the wrong idea when you showed up with me...
COOP83021
COOP83022
for sure
COOP83023
better... Thank you.
COOP83024
a cinch
once you're used to it.
COOP83025
COOP83026
figure out the whole kit and caboodle by
ourselves.
COOP83027
sooo... Look
over there.
COOP83028
'kay? Knock yourselves out.
COOP83029
COOP83030
wolves? Okay
COOP83031
flavor bases... Cream... Matcha...
COOP83032
Choco Banana Cream
cream base
COOP83033
bunch of videos on the subject already.
COOP83035
the wild world of crêpe making
{NAME1}-kun!?
COOP83037
COOP83038
You kids are naturals.
COOP83039
This can't be your first rodeo.
COOP83040
whatnot.
COOP83041
I was a little girl.
COOP83042
COOP83043
COOP83044
COOP83045
COOP83046
capable hands after all. Have at it
COOP83047
COOP83049
ever started baseball.
COOP83050
COOP83051
COOP83052
could help some more
COOP83054
customers than usual.
COOP83055
You've earned it.
COOP83056
thought it would be.
COOP83057
COOP83058
with me on such short notice.
COOP83059
without your help
COOP83060
work out!
COOP83062
COOP83063
feels like just the bottom of the first
inning.
COOP83064
Ahahaha!
COOP83065
away games.
COOP83066
stands really puts me at ease. It's kind of
childish I guess.
COOP83067
COOP83068
together again sometime?
COOP83069
understand if you can't. So
COOP83071
COOP83074
COOP83075
COOP83100
COOP83101
talking about? I found one I'd like to try.
COOP83102
could do it together?
COOP83104
beef bowl place in Shibuya.
COOP83105
this on you.
COOP83106
high up! And a little nerve-racking.
COOP83107
{NAME1}-kun!
COOP83108
saying...
COOP83109
them trouble lately. Stuff like spiking the
water pitchers with spice...
COOP83110
they've tossed onto the floor...
COOP83111
they're acting like Menaces.
COOP83112
I'm sure it's easier said than done
COOP83114
COOP83115
can do anything. Just like with my incident.
COOP83116
cameras or stay in the blind spots.
COOP83117
we could go for a pickoff? That should
work...
COOP83118
pitcher and first baseman tag out a runner
who's trying to steal second!
COOP83119
but the water kind
COOP83120
started! Fight on!
COOP83121
you like!
COOP83123
COOP83124
suspicious to you?
COOP83126
the boss was talking about?
COOP83128
COOP83129
water. Maybe they're just trying to flag down
some staff?
COOP83130
on the entire field.
COOP83131
someone's watching them.
COOP83132
Could you keep watch
COOP83134
customers hydrated!
COOP83135
COOP83136
Think he was up to something?
COOP83137
progress!
COOP83139
COOP83140
COOP83141
Boss! That guy!
COOP83142
Lemme go!
COOP83143
you're still recordin'!
COOP83144
there and don't let him touch it!
COOP83146
and kept collateral damage to a minimum.
COOP83147
traffic is up from the sound of it.
COOP83148
COOP83149
fielding skills to good use. It felt pretty
nice.
COOP83151
COOP83152
Thwarting the stolen base attempt...?
COOP83153
Wait
actually is though
COOP83154
thing if I were here by myself.
COOP83155
Ah
COOP83156
COOP83200
free today?
COOP83201
you think you could come with me maybe?
COOP83203
store in Shibuya.
COOP83204
it'll be busy... But I think we'll make it
work!
COOP83205
time then.
COOP83206
like to pay my water bill.
COOP83207
COOP83208
COOP83209
COOP83210
There's a ton to do
customers.
COOP83211
be freaking out behind the register.
COOP83212
One step at a time
COOP83213
shifts!
COOP83214
COOP83215
COOP83216

COOP83218
places! I didn't know you had a part-time
job.
COOP83219
these days. Oh
COOP83220
pretty tough on you
COOP83221
Such a shame. You were aiming for the pros
too
COOP83222
COOP83223
Slammer? One of those "Menaces
COOP83313
injury doing?
COOP83314
anymore!
COOP83315
around at this job
okay?
COOP83316
COOP83317
COOP83318
COOP83319
to this store as a customer...
COOP83320
the foodstuffs closer to the entrance.
COOP83321
roll through here on their way home from
school.
COOP83322
I'm sure they'd want a cheap
fill themselves up.
COOP83323
I can't just rearrange things however I like.
COOP83325
COOP83326
everything where it is now. I'd better give
it a think.
COOP83327
I'd better ask for the manager's permission
first.
COOP83328
COOP83329
COOP83330
COOP83331
Him too...
COOP83332
didn't you?
COOP83333
COOP83334
COOP83335
COOP83336
COOP83337
sworn... Hmmm...
COOP83338
COOP83339
trying to keep a low profile...

COOP83343

COOP83346
world championship winner amazing.
COOP83347

COOP83348

gorgeous!
COOP83349
world-class figure skater standing in front
of you!
COOP83350
she's on the news ALL the time.
COOP83351
since I got injured before the last
competition...
COOP83352
Another bird with broken wings so close by.
COOP83353
back to my sport as soon as possible
I could.
COOP83354
COOP83355
rehab's been over for a while!
COOP83356
too. Like {NAME1}-kun here!
COOP83358
quite close to work jobs together like this.
COOP83359
COOP83360
your big comeback?
COOP83361
in the air...
COOP83362
to ask...
COOP83363
really hard
COOP83364
COOP83365
nothing like what you have to do to get back
in the rink
COOP83366
exactly what you're going through when I
couldn't possibly...
COOP83367
COOP83368
tucked away. Here
COOP83369
COOP83370
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
COOP83371

COOP83382
COOP83384
COOP83385
COOP83387
a whole other box of inventory to put out.
COOP83388
COOP83389
manager about rearranging the merchandise.
COOP88230
where I can study in peace?
COOP88231
tomorrow

COOP88232
good
session together...
COOP88234
COOP88235
COOP88237
looking elsewhere.
COOP88238
COOP88239
last week
COOP88240
earlier
like this... did I inconvenience you?
COOP88241
earlier to lead us straight here.
COOP88242
parents for having me over!
COOP88243
myself to them... It's the least I could do
for barging into your home like this.
COOP88245
COOP88246
COOP88247
your parents are away...
COOP88248
COOP88249
once...
COOP88250
without having to worry about others.
COOP88251
COOP88252
wanna hang out when we're done?
COOP88300
today?
COOP88301
plans...
COOP88303
COOP88305
COOP88310
I'd put together a bouquet for her.
COOP88311
health's taken a turn for the worse recently.
COOP88312
my way of saying thanks.
COOP88313
I could really use some help here...
COOP88315
COOP88316
give it my best shot!
COOP88317
this?
COOP88318
take a look around the shops here?
COOP88319
the vibe of underground malls.
COOP88320
so you'll never get bored.
COOP88321
outlet or boutique lately.
COOP88322
shopping. Now I'm all about enjoying the
atmosphere and interior decor too.
COOP88323
for detail? Or retail
COOP88324
recommend? If so
COOP88325
apply! You'd be surprised at the things you
discover in a job.
COOP88350
COOP88351
but it feels weird coming to this part of
town alone.
COOP88352
here a lot with someone or another.
COOP88353
out the bookstore
COOP88354
found myself putting off this errand.
COOP88355
with me.
COOP88357
COOP88358
weird shops around here...
COOP88359
is just up ahead.
COOP88360
minor league baseball magazines
COOP88361
COOP88362
a movie or something
COOP88363
lots of places I haven't been to.
COOP88364
looking for part-time staff.
COOP88380
really decided what to do with my wage.
COOP88381
family
COOP88382
I haven't done anything to thank you
have I?
COOP88383
present that you end up not liking though...
COOP88384
of taking you to Suidobashi came up!
COOP88385
kind of thing
on me.
COOP88386
holding back
COOP88388
idea
COOP88389
do first?
COOP88390
wheel? I heard good things about the food!
COOP88391
pretty much down for anything.
COOP88392
me know if you want me to get you anything
{NAME1}-kun.
COOP88394
schedules line up
COOP88395
so maybe we can save those for next time!
COOP88410
you know.
COOP88411
games when we were little.
COOP88412
on a trip down memory lane.
COOP88413
reason I wanted to come here today!
COOP88414
refreshment stands around here...
COOP88415
asked if I could help out
COOP88416
so I figured I'd give it a shot.
COOP88417
so I kind of want to process my feelings.
COOP88418
then I could handle things a bit better.
COOP88419
drag you out here like this.
COOP88421
to me.
COOP88422
here helps a lot.
COOP88423
this.
COOP88424
Maybe I can treat you to something.
COOP88440
COOP88441
here a lot when I was little.
COOP88442
the year—the blossoms of spring
of fall
COOP88443
plans in the park today.
COOP88444
session nearby for Tokyo volunteers
COOP88445
about it...
COOP88446
those part-time jobs. Thanks to you
able to walk right in there!
COOP88447
anxious...
COOP88449
COOP88450
thought into it
COOP88451
part-time work. That's all
COOP88452
interested in volunteering?
COOP88453
is for your travel expenses.
COOP88454
Helping cats get adopted
COOP88455
that sounds interesting
COOP89982
COOP89983
wanted something like this for a while!
COOP89984
Thanks so much! Ehehe...
COOP89985
COOP89986
this. Thanks! I'm really happy.
COOP89988
where we go.
COOP89989
COOP89990
COOP89991
if that's okay? Sorry.
COOP89992

COOP89993

COOP89994
thinking...
COOP89995
Thanks for coming along with me.
COOP89996
so soothing.
COOP90000
tomatoes out of there.
COOP90001
sold by the pack.
COOP90002
can I take from this? Wait
COOP90005
COOP90006
COOP90007
expiration date is soon
still okay if I eat it today?
COOP90008
different from the regular produce?
COOP90009
bargain box is discounted too? Or not?
COOP90010
COOP90012
to me! You were a huge help!
COOP90013
spare?
COOP90014
COOP90015
studying at a Japanese college. I live around
this area.
COOP90016
of thing happens pretty much on the daily.
COOP90017
COOP90019
a lot?
COOP90021
COOP90022
some tea...
COOP90023
tea in bulk
COOP90024
used to buying waaay bigger ones back home.
COOP90026
COOP90027
and there's a lot of stuff I don't understand.
COOP90028
room
became this whole thing.
COOP90029
heck are "incandescent" ones? I've never even
seen those at the store.
COOP90030
I have a bit of a favor to ask.
COOP90031
COOP90033
appreciate it!
COOP90034
I could really use a friend right now...
COOP90036
there. You seem like a great guy!
COOP90037
COOP90038
COOP90039
get out of this
COOP90040
I can't be the only one benefiting!
COOP90041
time we meet!
COOP90044
COOP90045
I can practically taste those leaves already!
COOP90100
COOP90101
opinion on.
COOP90103
COOP90104
COOP90105
COOP90106
said to me...
COOP90160
COOP90107
wouldn't be too difficult for me to wrap
my head around.
COOP90108
the wind kinda fell outta my sails.
COOP90109
about my studies.
COOP90111
me figure that out.
COOP90112
COOP90113
folks shelled out for this
COOP90114
there's nothing I really want to do in Japan.
COOP90115
life here is far from boring
COOP90116
come here?"
COOP90117
I'm the one who chose this.
COOP90119
COOP90120
but it really is a problem.
COOP90121
be in real trouble!
COOP90122
something from the start.
COOP90124
making sure I study hard and learn a lot. But
the thing is...
COOP90125
important to study other cultures.
COOP90126
feels like a waste.
COOP90127
COOP90129
the same thing.
COOP90130
but it's important to me.
COOP90131
to do is actually soul-crushing.
COOP90132
I want to do?
COOP90133
hang on
this?
COOP90134
country. Please
COOP90136
Zhuge Liang!
COOP90137
is... But you're doing me a huge solid by
helping!
COOP90138
that stuff you taught me at the supermarket?
Super helpful!
COOP90139
I totally understand
COOP90140
I'm going to call you "Sensei" from now on!
COOP90141
COOP90142
tons of tools and recipes I know!
COOP90143
you think!
COOP90146
and buddy
COOP90147
COOP90148
COOP90149
thoughts swirling around my head about what
comes next.
COOP90150
feel excited about the future.
COOP90151
COOP90152
COOP90153
COOP90154
COOP90155
than me
COOP90156
younger than me too aren't you
COOP90157
find a purpose fast!
COOP90200
go with you today.
COOP90201
COOP90203
go to Jinbocho.
COOP90204
countries helped me feel closer to them.
COOP90205
COOP90206
to me!
COOP90207
COOP90209
Book Town in Jinbocho.
COOP90210
but the stories don't do it justice!
COOP90211
the booksellers here are chummy with Chinese
literary masters.
COOP90212
Sensei! The browsing awaits!
COOP90213
single publisher!
COOP90214
COOP90215
and TV shows!
COOP90216
secondhand books. Amazing!
COOP90217
players...
COOP90218
those old-timey Hong Kong movies!
COOP90219
COOP90220
see...
COOP90221
COOP90223
out the gate.
COOP90224
with more of a plan. Sorry...
COOP90225
the race.
COOP90226
curry. Let's take a break for a bite!
COOP90228
famous.
COOP90229
COOP90230
COOP90232
More like mild I guess. Tasty
COOP90233
like without trying it for yourself.
COOP90234
be more students.
COOP90235
their studies too.
COOP90237
some people...
COOP90238
purpose.
COOP90239
passionate about
own right.
COOP90240
abroad?
COOP90241
countries or anything before. Hmm...
COOP90243
overseas somewhere? Japan or otherwise.
COOP90244
studying abroad.
COOP90245
that's enough to get me motivated again!
COOP90246
process
COOP90247
figure it out
COOP90249
over there!
COOP90250
to tea and dim sum.
COOP90251
all day
COOP90252
but I really think some Longjing would hit
the spot right now.
COOP90253
fill you up after all that browsing.
COOP90300
you today.
COOP90301
COOP90303
choo choo!
COOP90304
you're free then!
COOP90305
to Harajuku...
COOP90306
the hustle and bustle!
COOP90307
COOP90308
hang out this time!
COOP90309
COOP90310
COOP90311
Harajuku sure is somethin' else!
COOP90313
the huge shopping malls in Chengdu.
COOP90314
celebrating the stuff they're into.
COOP90315
clothing stores and accessory shops
everywhere!
COOP90316
it's not just luxury brands either.
COOP90317
all over.
COOP90318
COOP90319
more than just buying fashionable clothes...
COOP90320
your own!
COOP90321
got! Even the snacks here are funky!
COOP90322
CHURROS!?
COOP90323
COOP90324
crêpes
COOP90325
think they make spicy crêpes!?
COOP90327
wouldn't say no if they had it.
COOP90328
go buy a couple.
COOP90329
one with the lettuce is...
COOP90331
Crunch! Hehe
COOP90332
COOP90333
COOP90334
proper hot crêpe.
COOP90335
COOP90339
kinda boosted my spirits.
COOP90340
doesn't make a lot of sense
COOP90341
much fun.
COOP90342
love
COOP90343
Unlike me.
COOP90345
without comparing myself to others.
COOP90346
for that
COOP90347
wushu masters! Way cool!
COOP90348
something for you.
COOP90351
get the Yaoling seal of approval!
COOP90352
gonna try to make a spicy crêpe at home!
COOP90353
COOP90400
your advice today...
COOP90401
COOP90403
talk on!
COOP90404
around.
COOP90405
COOP90406
learned a whole bunch from them.
COOP90407
to go is—
COOP90408
COOP90410
She's my next-door neighbor!
COOP90411
a bit outside the movie theater the other
day.
COOP90412
you kno—
COOP90413
COOP90414
proper way!
COOP90415
COOP90416
COOP90417
COOP90418
COOP90419
about her.
COOP90420
her father died when she was little...
COOP90421
building a company from the ground up.
COOP90422
Pretty harshly
COOP90423
her daughter! Not at all!
COOP90424
feeling...
COOP90425
glance
COOP90426
when she pets the neighborhood dogs. She's
such a sweet girl!
COOP90427
COOP90429
seeing her get yelled at like that.
COOP90430
dynamic clearly isn't normal...
COOP90431
her mother says stuff that makes her cry.
That's not right.
COOP90432
future's supposed to be.
COOP90433
entire future for me...
COOP90434
or feel into consideration...
COOP90435
COOP90437
the answers for everything.
COOP90438
wit's end
COOP90439
Yukimi-san makes three!
COOP90440
COOP90441
anyway.
COOP90443
Sensei!
COOP90444
much as I am!
COOP90500
it today!
COOP90501
He's my sensei!
COOP90502
about life here in Japan.
COOP90504
extending the invitation.
COOP90505
were with Yaoling-san then as well.
COOP90506
COOP90507
Pleased to meet you.
COOP90508
girl could ever ask for! Hehe.
COOP90509
a bit of a hike
worth it!
COOP90510
It's like a festival!
COOP90511
crackers
COOP90512
need some tea too.
COOP90513
think Japanese tea would go best with the
other snacks.
COOP90514
you've done your research on the area.
COOP90515
a tea-filled tour of Nakamise Street for some
yummy snackaroos!
COOP90516
COOP90518
to the brim!
COOP90519
COOP90520
spirits
COOP90521
COOP90522
COOP90523
disgraceful display the other day.
COOP90524
COOP90525
like your mother said some really harsh
things to you.
COOP90526
COOP90527
and running a business all on her own.
COOP90528
harsh...
COOP90529
she holds herself and others to a higher
standard.
COOP90530
COOP90531
her daughter.
COOP90532
always been.
COOP90533
further proof of my inexperience and
immaturity.
COOP90535
treated this way
COOP90536
work when you're done with school
COOP90537
Want to be?
COOP90538
COOP90539
to fight for them... as a lawyer.
COOP90540
Everything my mother does is for my sake.
COOP90541
COOP90542
we retire for today as well?
COOP90543
wonderful time with you.
COOP90544
gratitude...
COOP90545
one of my favorite places in return for your
kindness.
COOP90546
Yaoling-san's efforts to learn more about
Japan.
COOP90548
COOP90549
to join you!
COOP90550
the invite! We'd love to join you.
COOP90551
I look forward to the next time we meet.
COOP90552
than I thought she'd be...
COOP90553
mother even more than before.
COOP90554
again. It seems like it'll take time
we can do is keep talking to her.
COOP90556
COOP90557
with me
COOP90558
COOP90570
invite Fujikawa-san to hang out today.
COOP90571
COOP90573
COOP90574
when our schedules line up.
COOP90600
COOP90601
I would be remiss if I ruined the surprise.
COOP90602
Japanese house! This floor and transom are
prime examples of Japanese architecture.
COOP90603
natural woodgrain look is really soothing.
COOP90604
COOP90605
sweets look so fancy!
COOP90606
they serve is more than adequate for the tea
ceremony.
COOP90607
such as this seemed a perfect opportunity for
enriching your knowledge of Japan.
COOP90608
and treats is the best!
COOP90609
I believe we can forgo the usual formalities.
COOP90611
to the order the sweets are brought out
carefully choreographed.
COOP90612
enjoyment.
COOP90613
Japan's culture of wholehearted hospitality.
COOP90614
tea ceremonies.
COOP90615
business manager to possess.
COOP90616
reason.
COOP90617
COOP90618
COOP90619
place.
COOP90620
tea's bitter aftertaste and the slight
blandness of the sweets...
COOP90621
perfectly!
COOP90622
whole bunch of trial and error
COOP90624
think so.
COOP90625
COOP90626
praise coming!
COOP90627
points of tea quite well.
COOP90628
COOP90629
excuse me!
COOP90630
or perhaps pu'er tea?
COOP90631
bean jelly.
COOP90632
COOP90633
don't have any at this establishment.
COOP90634
COOP90635
next cup of tea to be a bit hotter?
COOP90636
offer here is...
COOP90637
conversation between the proprietor and
the customer.
COOP90638
learning of the unique flavor the former has
worked to develop.
COOP90639
strive...
COOP90640
been given.
COOP90641
this principle is crucial.
COOP90642
COOP90643
told at face value.
COOP90644
thought into how it serves everything.
And everything was real tasty.
COOP90645
COOP90646
here and there I would personally do
differently...
COOP90647
bad thing?
COOP90648
COOP90650
don't matter because listening to your mother
is the right thing to do.
COOP90651
pain in your face.
COOP90652
your own.
COOP90653
as gospel.
COOP90654
COOP90655
COOP90656
You know nothing about me or my life!
COOP90657
COOP90658
I didn't mean to get on your case like that...
COOP90659
COOP90660
I had to say it there.
COOP90661
things... I get that now.
COOP90662
COOP90663
Yukimi-san out and troubling the staff
but...
COOP90664
COOP90665
someone else expects you to?
COOP90666
COOP90667
my parents.
COOP90668
Yukimi-san.
COOP90670
COOP90671
though.
COOP90673
wanted to say. Later
COOP90690
which day would be good for us to hang out.
COOP90692
COOP90693
head on over!
COOP90694
figure out a day that works for all of us.
COOP90700
Yukimi-san.
COOP90701
than anybody.
COOP90702
taking a second to think about her feelings
and made her really upset.
COOP90704
you
COOP90705
to make an opportunity to apologize and talk
it out.
COOP90706
drive-by apology. We need to sit down and
hash things out.
COOP90707
sit down and talk to her seriously she'll
listen
COOP90708
That's the least I can do
COOP90709
COOP90710
sake of making up doesn't feel right.
COOP90711
it for her sake!
COOP90712
say I didn't mean what I said? That won't
help Yukimi-san.
COOP90714
with the truth!
COOP90715
myself clearly. It's not just about getting
forgiveness.
COOP90716
really no other path forward
COOP90717
Can't go avoiding the heart of it.
COOP90718
COOP90719
there supporting me.
COOP90721
Sensei.
COOP90722
Wanna come with?
COOP90723
COOP90724

COOP90733
started.
COOP90734
COOP90735
way she'll hear me out.
COOP90736
for this.
COOP90737
COOP90738
Chinese tea is in the mix.
COOP90739
home turf.
COOP90740
COOP90741
I would've stewed over it until I ended up
spitting out some half-hearted apology.
COOP90742
COOP90743
You're always here when I need you...
COOP90744
take the time to go shopping with me and
stuff...
COOP90747
COOP90748
anyway! I'm looking forward to the tea party!
COOP90750
COOP90751
into it a little bit
COOP90752
saying?
COOP90753
same for a while...
COOP90756
a little more time to spare?
COOP90790
happened with Yukimi-san the other day.
COOP90791
COOP90793
COOP90794
figure out a day that works for all of us.
COOP90800
talk to Yukimi-san.
COOP90801
COOP90803

COOP90812
it now so the flavor doesn't get too strong.
COOP90813
more of a light crimson? Both are exquisite.
COOP90814
even in China.
COOP90815
A fermented tea you can find anywhere.
COOP90816
with the sweet bean jelly.
COOP90817
A Chinese sweet made with powdered sugar
and corn syrup...
COOP90818
COOP90819
to simmered Japanese red beans.
COOP90820
Japanese sweets very often
as a paste in Chinese sweets regularly.
COOP90821
Japanese tea quite well.
COOP90822
greatly by region.
COOP90823
flavor profiles to produce this meal.
COOP90824
surprise that there're infinite ways of
pairing teas and sweets together.
COOP90825
COOP90826
you gave me was delicious.
COOP90827
you before regarding the tea ceremony.
COOP90828
understanding between proprietor and
customer.
COOP90829
for the sake of that purpose.
COOP90830
COOP90831
intentions of the proprietor.
COOP90832
outside
COOP90833
contrary to what's been decided
how respectable they might be.
COOP90834
culture of tea ceremony.
COOP90835
standards
other...
COOP90838
if I back down now.
COOP90839
gotta ask after hearing you say that.
COOP90840
reflect your own personal feelings?
COOP90841
was proper?
COOP90842
COOP90843
history behind Chinese cuisine.
COOP90844
until about 500 years ago.
COOP90845
weren't a proper Sichuan seasoning
COOP90846
world.
COOP90847
COOP90848
high regard
COOP90849
valuable unless you assess it for yourself.
COOP90850
right ideas are right for me!
COOP90851
right for me is me!
COOP90852
huh?
COOP90853
in the whole wide world
COOP90854
to do with your life. So...
COOP90855
want to.
COOP90856
COOP90857
COOP90858
full right now.
COOP90859
COOP90860
COOP90861
comes to tea service
unquestionable.
COOP90862
COOP90864
it'll be all right!
COOP90865
what I had to say.
COOP90866
COOP90867
my chest.
COOP90869
enough to express my gratitude
COOP90871
pepper that we have mapo tofu and
mouthwatering chicken.
COOP90872
who came up with that!
COOP90874
COOP90875
relax a bit.
COOP90876
COOP90900
something important to talk to you about.
COOP90902

COOP90903
you've got a minute.
COOP90904
party

COOP90905

COOP90909
stuff at the tea party. Hehehe!
COOP90910
out with her mother.
COOP90911
after all!
COOP90912
way she wanted to help her mother way back
when.
COOP90913
COOP90915
this experience.
COOP90916
to follow their way of doing things without
question.
COOP90917
onto other people.
COOP90918
the different ways of thinking out there...
COOP90919
move forward. That's what Yukimi-san
taught me.
COOP90920
now on.
COOP90921
face things head-on.
COOP90922
all this time.
COOP90923
enough to understand something.
COOP90924
sense of common knowledge and way of thinking
doesn't totally translate.
COOP90925
he wanted me to find my own answers.
COOP90927
COOP90928
smart things when you do talk.
COOP90929
dramatic
COOP90930
finally ascends to enlightenment!
COOP90931
did before.
COOP90932
the point of me studying here...
COOP90933
keep helping me out from now on
COOP90934
COOP90936
lady at the supermarket to start selling tea
in bulk already!
COOP90937

COOP92005
COOP92006
COOP99996
go? I'll leave it up to you!
COOP99997
other time!
COOP99998
Great minds think alike
COOP99999
now. Any other ideas
COOP92010
COOP92011
exploring today. Wanna come with?
COOP92013
a lot from you!
COOP92015
time
COOP92016
COOP92017
vibe if you know what I mean.
COOP92018
crammed with niche shops! The big city can
feel suffocating sometimes.
COOP92019
that a Japanese confectionery I see!?
COOP92020
water! Mind if we go buy some?
COOP92022
COOP92023
you insist then... okay!
COOP92024
Sensei? No wonder we get along.
COOP92025
the streets
the eats...
COOP92026
That's what matters.
COOP92027
Zoshigaya again sometime
COOP92028
neck of the woods.
COOP92035
beautiful.
COOP92036
you'd still have to dash if you forgot your
umbrella...
COOP92037
culture! At least that's what my language
teacher said.
COOP92038
wanting for options on the way home!
COOP92040
food is culture?
COOP92041
high in "high school life."
COOP92042
That's my motto.
COOP92043
me to see one of your favorite haunts!
COOP92044
the life of Sensei looks like...
COOP92045
growling!
COOP92046
a giant hamburger!
COOP92048
way to the station
COOP92055
while...
COOP92056
the inside.
COOP92057
smoky stained glass tell a wonderful story
of its past.
COOP92058
and equipment they use for Mass...
COOP92059
dignified in here. Don't wanna get in
the way.
COOP92060
from time to time. Doubt I'd ever tire of it.
COOP92061
comes here to mull over her strategies...
COOP92062
have you ever met her?
COOP92064
and going
great place to think.
COOP92065
like! Inquiring minds want to know.
COOP92066
Still
COOP92067
to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.
COOP92068
do
COOP92075
so much about!
COOP92076
usually expect from Japanese cuisine...
COOP92077
serve at stalls during street festivals.
COOP92078
the dry ingredients
shape?
COOP92079
of the donut
all together.
COOP92080
sauce alone is making my mouth water.
COOP92081
flavor!
COOP92082
different from the last one.
COOP92083
screams "Japan
Basically
the sauce below them.
COOP100316
to town when mixin' it
COOP100317
COOP100318
okay
COOP100319
say "to taste" on the packet...
COOP100320
COOP100322
COOP100323
a candle to the monjayaki place. But I was
wrong.
COOP100324
too much chili paste.
COOP100325
I thought it was just a worse version of
restaurant food.
COOP100326
COOP100327
It gives 'em this texture that won't quit
even if they're not eaten immediately.
COOP100328
it prevents spillage during transport and
keeps the noodles from absorbing it.
COOP100329
if the ingredients were cut larger...
COOP100330
consideration too!
COOP100331
hey
COOP100332
served in restaurants
COOP100333
They don't have the time to sit down and eat
in a relaxed place.
COOP100334
ingredients are small on purpose.
COOP100335
reminds me of the packed lunches my mom
would make...
COOP100336
from me all of a sudden.
COOP100337
to bring lunch from home back in middle
school.
COOP100338
the graveyard shift.
COOP100339
each and every day.
COOP100340
COOP100341
about this.
COOP100342
you can see the hard work people put into the
food you eat every day.
COOP100343
with you
food is.
COOP100345
I still have a long way to go.
COOP100346
COOP100347
realization shows I've grown a bit.
COOP100348
COOP100349
do whatever it takes to become a chef of
that caliber!
COOP100350
gettin' so down.
COOP100351
only one on this journey anymore.
COOP100353
the... Japanese pepper... kickin' in...
COOP100354
COOP100400
COOP100401
You comin'?
COOP100403
COOP100404
from before that's caught my eye.
COOP100405
Let's go.
COOP100406
COOP100407
for a limited time only.
COOP100408
so many bowls
COOP100409
so it looks like we're in luck.
COOP100410
COOP100411
must be where they got the inspo for this.
COOP100412
too. What a great deal.
COOP100414
unusual as it is rare.
COOP100415
before.
COOP100416
say you were hungry
COOP100417
it won't disappoint. Let's dig in.
COOP100418
covered in curry.
COOP100419
to be...
COOP100420
COOP100421
had before to thin out the curry.
COOP100422
and noodle thickness? They must make the roux
from scratch!
COOP100423
COOP100425
people use store-bought products
COOP100426
I forget what's goin' on around me.
COOP100427
wasn't I?
COOP100428
COOP100429
roux here.
COOP100430
gotta fry the flour in butter slowly
doesn't burn.
COOP100431
the same time. When does the chef find time
to sleep?
COOP100432
COOP100433
even more where that came from.
COOP100434
but with curry you gotta have rice as well.
COOP100435
better with a side of rice.
COOP100436
that's why they made it into a set meal.
COOP100437
that was.
COOP100438
sure that you enjoy each and every bite.
COOP100439
get so much outta a single bowl.
COOP100440
COOP100441
COOP100442
havin' ramen with my dad at home...
COOP100443
my attention
appetite.
COOP100444
ramen.
COOP100445
him somehow.
COOP100446
nor was he around much at home with his job
as a truck driver...
COOP100447
and thought I should try it.
COOP100448
he's gone.
COOP100449
and I now live with my mom.
COOP100450
make my mom's life easier...
COOP100451
search for my ideal flavors.
COOP100453
COOP100454
about their mom?
COOP100455
that
COOP100457
COOP100458
have my head if she sees it!
COOP100460
like he has a promising future ahead of him.
COOP100500
COOP100501
You comin'?
COOP100503
COOP100504
just started a collab menu with another
big-name restaurant.
COOP100505
go to the Shibuya branch since it's closest.
COOP100506
COOP100507
shop's spicy tsukemen.
COOP100508
powder in it. Fish powder is basically ground
up dried fish.
COOP100509
and then dip the noodles in it before eating.
COOP100510
It's one of my personal favorites.
COOP100511
this diner chain... Time to find out.
COOP100512
was all about...
COOP100514
with the tsukemen from the one they've done
before.
COOP100515
that you'd only find at a diner.
COOP100516
yeah?
COOP100517
restaurant and boiled to be a little softer.
COOP100518
lowered the spice to suit the family-friendly
setting.
COOP100519
while still maintaining their signature
spicy-but-oh-so-good taste.
COOP100520
carefully thought out.
COOP100521
so that even inexperienced line cooks
can make it.
COOP100522
to avoid if you want to maintain the flavor.
COOP100523
doesn't mean it can't still be just as good
in another form.
COOP100524
COOP100525
reveal so much...
COOP100526
Shun Kano-kun?
COOP100527
COOP100528

other plans

COOP100534

COOP100556
So more traditional ramen then?
COOP100557
degree of innovation will be required.
COOP100558
your ramen... I'll be waiting.
COOP100559
rattled by what Serizawa-san said earlier.
COOP100560
so I'll just have to swallow my doubts as
best I can.
COOP100561
needed.
COOP100562
COOP100564
not to love about ramen? But how would I
spice it up?
COOP100565

for.
COOP100614
you think
COOP100615
I don't think you can win with impact alone.
COOP100616
thing weird about it is how it looks.
COOP100617
I based this on all of those times together.
COOP100618

I could muster. And I think the flavors
aren't too shabby.
COOP100627
it
COOP100629
overshadow the actual taste...
COOP100630
eat it...? That's a good point.
COOP100631

the competition. Figured I could use a break.
COOP100804
chow.
COOP100805
best. But where would we go for that...?
COOP100807
COOP100808
perfect.
COOP100809
COOP100810
COOP100811
so I think I'll have somethin' other than
ramen.
COOP100812
COOP100814
fried rice
COOP100815
Scuse me
COOP100816
y'know!
COOP100817
right? Scuse me
please.
COOP100818
COOP100819
in the kitchen about once a week now.
COOP100821
order of fried rice?
COOP100822
much lately. All good?
COOP100823
pretty well yourself.
COOP100824
but that won't stop me from comin' here all
the time.
COOP100825
Kitchen
COOP100826
too long.
COOP100827
been cooked to perfection.
COOP100828
always has this great fluffiness to it.
COOP100829
rice tastes. Chef
cooking?
COOP100830
COOP100831
COOP100832
fried rice you got there?
COOP100833
COOP100834
one bite.
COOP100835
COOP100837
COOP100838
maybe...
COOP100839
the menu at Heritage Kitchen...
COOP100840
regulars
COOP100841
adjust the seasoning accordingly.
COOP100842
came in.
COOP100843
fried rice
moisture.
COOP100844
absolutely amazing
COOP100845
COOP100846
have less lard in them
COOP100847
noodles and wanted a change of pace
COOP100848
light and dry with little liquid.
COOP100849
but it seems a bit fluffier than usual...
COOP100850
COOP100851
faces
COOP100852
some nosy creep runnin' it.
COOP100853
COOP100854
Hey... {NAME2}
COOP100856
COOP100857
didn't hang out with me today
COOP100858
forever loved by one and all...
COOP100859
will be forever loved by one and all...
COOP100860
COOP100861
I could help you at least.
COOP100862
COOP100863
to get a bite of his as well...
COOP100864
his plate.
COOP100865
fluffiness
COOP100866
you mind givin' some to Shige-san?
COOP100867
COOP100868
out. I need to do the same.
COOP100870
I made with you.
COOP100900
COOP100901
COOP100902
today. I've finished my new entry for the
competition.
COOP100903
COOP100905
COOP100906
day then.
COOP100907
on giving this another try.
COOP100908
COOP100909
assessment; I'll take it in stride. Today I
give you an absolute classic.
COOP100910
run-of-the-mill shoyu ramen.
COOP100911
COOP100912
broth. The taste somewhat reminds me of the
ramen from Victory Kitchen.
COOP100913
ramen flavor.
COOP100914
an entry like this any other way.
COOP100915
COOP100916
COOP100917
COOP100918
one before?
COOP100919
COOP100920
COOP100921
ramen... But this one is totally different in
terms of richness!
COOP100922
identical ingredients and using the same
method.
COOP100923
garlic I added at the end
of the broth...
COOP100924
making gradual adjustments in a bid for a
vastly different finish.
COOP100925
today is...
COOP100926
adjusted to suit the state of the person
eatin' it.
COOP100928
Pops's fried rice gave me the idea.
COOP100929
inspired this ramen.
COOP100930
with you. But I'll make more
till then.
COOP100931
their mood
bunch of other stuff.
COOP100932
result in a less high-quality dish.
COOP100933
intuition alone.
COOP100934
other than regulars.
COOP100935
do the trick.
COOP100936
still let a chef guarantee it'll taste good.
COOP100937
sleepy... A variation for every occasion.
COOP100938
COOP100939
the same taste can be recreated at any store.
COOP100940
COOP100941
This is the entry you're proposing
Kano-kun?
COOP100942
COOP100943
you're able to creatively tailor dishes to
fit individual customers...
COOP100944
that will be forever loved by one and all"
with flying colors.
COOP100945
looking forward to seeing how it fares in the
competition.
COOP100947
the world to me!
COOP100948
tweakin' this until the day of the comp.
COOP100949
COOP100950
you're starvin'
you later.
COOP100951
remarks about the ramenburger.
COOP100952
to rise to the challenge as a chef of your
own making.
COOP100953
COOP100954
much advice to an exhibitor like myself?
COOP100955
Kitchen and was tryin' to develop my palate
with {NAME2}...
COOP100956
now that I have finished reviewing your
entry.
COOP100957
approach you take to food.
COOP100958
COOP100959
struggled to communicate with even me
own daughter.
COOP100960
customers enjoy his food.
COOP100961
COOP100962
I handle far more money each day than my
father's store ever did.
COOP100963
COOP100964
like my father's did?
COOP100965
I'm reminded of my father.
COOP100966
COOP100967
COOP100968
Shun Kano-kun.
COOP100969
welcomes your participation.
COOP100970
COOP100971

COOP100972
our hangin' out has led to.
COOP101000
COOP101001
COOP101002
I want you to try.
COOP101004
in no time.
COOP101005
time when you're free.
COOP101006
in the home ec room. Give it a try.
COOP101007
so it's pretty simple without any toppings
or special seasoning...
COOP101008
and you only to eat.
COOP101009
other day...
COOP101010
didn't prepare you a bowl too.
COOP101011
thank you for helping me on that long journey
to find my ideal flavors.
COOP101012
entered into the competition was well
received.
COOP101013
disappointin' her.
COOP101014
the ramen at Heritage Kitchen.
COOP101015
taste of somethin' I created from scratch.
COOP101016
COOP101017
got a rough sense for your preferences.
COOP101019
progress
COOP101020
COOP101021
flavors. It just so happened I also learned
what you liked...
COOP101022
what you think.
COOP101023
COOP101025
I got that feelin' when I was eatin'
with you.
COOP101026
with your feedback.
COOP101027
What better compliment is there than that?
COOP101028
different types of soy sauce for the base?
COOP101029
COOP101030
I need to keep developing my palate.
COOP101031
an ear
COOP101033
COOP101034
I'll never find the flavors I'm aimin' for.
COOP101035
regard.
COOP101036
for you
COOP101037
COOP101039
but first I have to fulfill my promise.
COOP109002
COOP109003
wanted it so bad!
COOP109004
COOP109005
COOP109006

COOP108903
COOP108905
COOP109012
COOP109013
wanted it so bad!
COOP109014
COOP109015
COOP109016
your way.
COOP109022
try it.
COOP109023
today
COOP109024
should see what's in the area.
COOP109025
here. Where should we go today?
COOP109026
better understanding of art might help me
develop my palette...
COOP109600
soba bento!
COOP109601
Makes you wonder if it's any good.
COOP109602
good as the fresh stuff?
COOP109603
flavor?
COOP109604
COOP109605
COOP109606
restaurant-level quality from a convenience
store sounds nice.
COOP109607
price you pay at the restaurant.
COOP109608
COOP109609
warmed up?
COOP109610
either pork or miso for the base.
COOP109611
each and trade.
COOP109612
Don't think I could finish 'em both on
my own.
COOP109613
the convenience store. I got a
bento by a classic restaurant.
COOP109614
the convenience store. I got a
pasta dish by a famous chef.
COOP109615
the convenience store. I got a
popular patisserie's dessert.
COOP109616
the convenience store. I got
some snacks from my childhood.
COOP109617
the convenience store. I got
fried snacks from the counter.
COOP109618
lunch?
COOP109619
you
COOP109620
COOP109621
I'll never get sick of it.
COOP109622
that way for years.
COOP109623
and then.
COOP109624
to eat.
COOP109625
afternoon classes?
COOP109626
something.
COOP109627
After all
under your nose.
COOP109628
COOP109629
COOP109630
kinda tight for me this month.
COOP109631
now. Think we could split today?
COOP109632
hang out. That's a promise.
COOP109633
with Shun. We nabbed stuff
that's usually out of stock.
COOP109634
with Shun. We were hungry and
ended up buying way too much.
COOP109635
with Shun. We observed what
was popular before buying.
COOP109636
with Shun. He gave me the
rundown on the new stock.
COOP109637
with Shun. I decided to treat
him today.
COOP109638
they also have great restaurants here.
COOP109639
so the turnover rate's sky high.
COOP109640
you're here?
COOP109641
COOP109642
district
COOP109643
what's hot and what's not...
COOP109644
went from my school uniform to my chef's
clothing and that was that.
COOP109645
some time
COOP109646
that in a weird way.
COOP109647
so I didn't expect it.
COOP109648
about it some time.
COOP109649
what they're offering.
COOP109650
about.
COOP109651
toppings were a little unusual.
COOP109652
over what you're gonna order too.
COOP109653
We joined a line of customers
snaked around a crêpe shop.
COOP109654
He asked for my verdict on the
ramen we had together.
COOP109655
We looked at clothes before
heading to a restaurant.
COOP109656
We had a fun time
eating on the go.
COOP109657
Today
COOP109658
COOP109659
next to brand new ones.
COOP109660
blend of the old and new.
COOP109661
COOP109662
COOP109663
COOP109664
the air.
COOP109665
'em with a fan
lure in customers the old-fashioned way.
COOP109666
head over.
COOP109667
that sorta stuff much thought.
COOP109668
are all about making their food look flashy.
COOP109669
Let's look for that.
COOP109670
while we eat.
COOP109671
be a waste to not see what they're about.
COOP109672
COOP109673
customers. Let's check it out later.
COOP109674
We strolled while enjoying
traditional snacks.
COOP109675
We tried trendy treats while
meandering the streets.
COOP109676
A friendly shop owner offered
us free samples.
COOP109677
We munched on fresh
meat cutlets and croquettes...
COOP109678
We snacked on street food
and washed off at a bathhouse.
COOP109679
researcher.
COOP109680
food is an art form.
COOP109681
in museums
COOP109682
much sense to me.
COOP109683
could be similar in some ways.
COOP109684
cooking.
COOP109685
COOP109686
a lot of effort.
COOP109687
end up with somethin' you approve of.
COOP109688
what the creator struggled with.
COOP109689
customer said it first.
COOP109690
and the same.
COOP109691
as studyin' someone else's art.
COOP109692
better by lookin' at the art on display here.
COOP109693
you'll know when you try it.
COOP109694
to be able to tell.
COOP109700
ask you...
COOP109701
desserts?
COOP109702
that sorta thing.
COOP109704
godsend!
COOP109705
Do you live near a supermarket?
COOP109707
Whenever works for you.
COOP109708
COOP109709
COOP109710
a lot about someone by their kitchen.
COOP109711
totally your vibe
COOP109712
in a place as nice as this.
COOP109714
COOP109715
to put into words...
COOP109716
I've been feelin' like I haven't been taking
my cookin' seriously enough.
COOP109717
out of my wheelhouse.
COOP109718
things up from time to time. Y'know
somethin' unrelated to ramen.
COOP109719
develop my palette more
hangin' out...
COOP109720
as a chance to unwind a little bit.
COOP109721
kitchen
so get ready for a taste explosion!
COOP109722
I'll keep 'em in mind for next time.
COOP109723
culinary repertoire!
COOP110000
COOP110001
COOP110004
COOP110006
an ear!?
COOP110007
COOP110008
COOP110009
teenager's feelings and— Oh!
COOP110010
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP110011
buggin'
COOP110012
with us for a while.
COOP110013
you two are around the same age.
COOP110014
kind of special actor?
COOP110015
while going to acting school.
COOP110017
COOP110018
dream in this day and age... I really want to
support him.
COOP110019
generation gap is wider than ever these days.
COOP110020
the type of person who doesn't know when to
shut up.
COOP110021
total space cadet?
COOP110023
need to learn what a girl wants to hear.
COOP110024
in myself
COOP110025
It's someone who's totally out of touch with
what's going on around them.
COOP110026
Huh... So kids today don't know that one?
COOP110027
COOP110028
stressing him out all the time?
COOP110029
trouble my hubby.
COOP110030
COOP110031
COOP110032
offered to hear me out!
COOP110033
how teens today feel.
COOP110034
a reliable young man.
COOP110035
you too.
COOP110036
a stylist before I got married?
COOP110037
just a sec.
COOP110038
COOP110040
COOP110041
no duh.
COOP110042
he brings samples home for me all the time.
COOP110043
to toe!
COOP110044
COOP110046
Your home's nearby
COOP110047
size should be right.
COOP110048
COOP110050
COOP110051
COOP110053
COOP110054
for me! I've got to be a good wife
auntie...
COOP110055
girl gotta wear!?
COOP110057
feel like I'm back in school too.
COOP110058
was young. And there's my hubby
COOP110059
socks! Hubby and I were unstoppable
back then!
COOP110061
more from now on!
COOP110063
home early today.
COOP110064
COOP110201
COOP110202
Remember how you were going to teach me all
about how teens feel?
COOP110203
about. Do you have a minute?
COOP110205
COOP110206
time
COOP110207
the one who wants to be an actor.
COOP110208
been messaging back and forth
COOP110209
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP110211
COOP110212
these days isn't any different from texting
messages.
COOP110213
photographs you took on your phone.
COOP110214
right...?
COOP110215
thought I'd go pick him up from the station.
COOP110216
looks like
via MMS...
COOP110217
I was talking about!
COOP110218
than teens these days.
COOP110220
COOP110221
something like this
been all about!?
COOP110222
COOP110223
book. Did you know that when you said it?
COOP110224
something like this
been all about!?
COOP110225
to make me admit to!?
COOP110226
thing?
COOP110227
like this
about!?
COOP110228
to meet someone took so much effort.
COOP110229
so I had to call his house number.
COOP110230
sooo awkward when his mom answered!
COOP110231
to see him. If I could just recapture that
feeling
COOP110232
Now I'm raring to go!
COOP110234
a second.
COOP110235
COOP110236
COOP110237
COOP110238
COOP110239
tomorrow. See you later!
COOP110401
you lately.
COOP110402
from my teenage consultant.
COOP110403
Do you have some time to spare?
COOP110405
quick by my standards.
COOP110406
time
COOP110407
have on you?
COOP110409
COOP110410
someone out of nowhere
COOP110411
ex-delinquent!?
COOP110412
He started living with us recently.
COOP110413
ex-stylist
he's wearing.
COOP110414
wallet. So
cash on him.
COOP110415
cashless? And paying with a "smart wallet"?
COOP110416
something everyone experienced.
COOP110417
feeling either
COOP110419
I do.
COOP110420
COOP110421
COOP110422
that situation one day.
COOP110423
in general
COOP110424
took me to a really nice teppanyaki place.
COOP110425
time when we were graduating.
COOP110426
there was a whole hibachi performance!
COOP110427
my hubby went to go pay for everything.
COOP110428
with a worried look on his face.
COOP110429
the emotions were almost too much to handle.
COOP110430
too good at getting stories out of me!
COOP110431
memories I guess. But now we can't share
that anymore...
COOP110432
COOP110434
first place.
COOP110435
a wallet.
COOP110436
I'll just leave it to your imagination!
COOP110437
even sure what it is I wanted to ask...
COOP110438
talking with you
COOP110439
COOP110440
staying with us.
COOP110441
back for more advice another time!
COOP110443
out to dry!
COOP110444
COOP110601
COOP110602
more about modern teens.
COOP110603
Is now a good time?
COOP110605
Short for me at least.
COOP110606
spare moment
COOP110607
someone is proof that you're close?
COOP110608
it gets
COOP110609
candid in telling us what he wants.
COOP110610
though he's been with us for a while!
COOP110611
COOP110613
snapping at adults for no good reason.
COOP110614
I'd rather we fight and make up right after.
COOP110615
COOP110616
COOP110617
dislike me...
COOP110618
job and left home just this year.
COOP110619
understanding with him because of how rough
my relationship was with my parents.
COOP110620
each other's way... and so we never really
butt heads.
COOP110621
little present.
COOP110622
fancy Japanese sweets and stuff.
COOP110624
COOP110625
but listen!
COOP110626
chunky. Always have
COOP110627
We don't even know each other's preferences.
COOP110628
I thought I'd do for my nephew what I
couldn't fo—
COOP110629
COOP110630
COOP110631
COOP110632
with me sometimes since we're neighbors.
COOP110633
always talking about.
COOP110634
me stay here. Nice to meet you!
COOP110635
to be a... What kind of actor was it?
COOP110636
as an actor.
COOP110637
suits and pull stunts in shows with heavy
special effects.
COOP110638
remembering exactly what it's called.
COOP110639
like superhero flicks?
COOP110641
just fine.
COOP110642
Rangers or Riders from your childhood!
COOP110643
you secretly a superhero fanboy?
COOP110644
COOP110645
into the classic stuff.
COOP110646
resumes everywhere I can.
COOP110647
complaining or getting lazy. Anyway
meeting you!
COOP110648
good kid all around.
COOP110649
could you ever fight with such a sweet boy?
COOP110650
dislike me?
COOP110652
COOP110653
just overthinking things.
COOP110654
COOP110655
right? These dorayaki are filled with it.
COOP110656
swap contact info?
COOP110657
COOP110658
COOP110659
your contact info? You kids really don't
waste any time.
COOP110660
to learn about how teens feel.
COOP110661
COOP110662
understand. There must be
COOP110663
our talk.
COOP110664
COOP110666
COOP110667
COOP110668
COOP110801
COOP110802
how we talked about Leo-chan before?
COOP110803
have some time now?
COOP110805
I think it really will be short this time.
COOP110806
moment to spare
COOP110807
COOP110808
COOP110809
COOP110810
tomorrow.
COOP110811
I know I just have to do my best.
COOP110812
a kid because I thought they were cool.
COOP110813
I've pictured in my head since way back then.
COOP110814
practice. I shouldn't even be standing here
talking right now!
COOP110815
tomorrow
COOP110816
COOP110817
audition for a TV show.
COOP110818
COOP110819
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP110821
good cold.
COOP110822
sweet or savory!
COOP110823
person as well!
COOP110824
I'll make...
COOP110825
beefsteak!
COOP110827
brim with my love!
COOP110828
worried about his next checkup.
COOP110829
burn it all off in no time.
COOP110830
COOP110831
all for today! Nice and quick!
COOP110832
COOP110833
dreams when I was in high school.
COOP110835
I was kind of a reckless kid.
COOP110836
instead of studying...
COOP110837
turn around and say I wanted to be a stylist.
COOP110838
COOP110839
of course I rebelled back then.
COOP110840
still never approved...
COOP110841
I know I already said we were finished.
COOP110842
some weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
COOP110843
COOP110844
COOP110846
because your parents aren't home!
COOP111001
you here.
COOP111002
COOP111003
time to talk?
COOP111005
much for me to figure out alone.
COOP111006
you do have some time?
COOP111007
before?
COOP111008
so well...
COOP111009
what to say.
COOP111011
harm than good.
COOP111012
COOP111013
to help if you were me?
COOP111014
I really want to help him if I can!
COOP111015
an actor is that he only has so much time.
COOP111016
didn't get anywhere within the year.
COOP111017
I want his dream to come true.
COOP111018
always have some obstacles...
COOP111019
his morale up
COOP111020
tasty meal?
COOP111021
COOP111023
COOP111024
Oh no! Do I know nothing about him?
COOP111025
fussing over him
COOP111026
make it harder on him.
COOP111027
for it to have the opposite effect.
COOP111028
COOP111029
get sick of having it two nights in a row?
COOP111030
for helping me with something so tough!
COOP111032
easy
COOP111033
second?
COOP111034
kinds of stuff
COOP111035
advice myself.
COOP111036
nowhere...
COOP111038
COOP111039
outside in a bit?
COOP111041
COOP111042
COOP111043
didn't go well
COOP111044
decent performance.
COOP111045
came after.
COOP111047
for words at least.
COOP111048
COOP111049
anything special I keep in mind while I'm
performing.
COOP111050
so I figured I might as well be honest.
COOP111051
COOP111052
COOP111053
awkwardly disappointed?
COOP111054
COOP111055
answer for him would be.
COOP111056
COOP111058
perform...
COOP111059
COOP111060
me to
COOP111061
answer.
COOP111062
on this some more.
COOP111063
why Kayo-san comes to you all the time.
COOP111065
much
COOP111066
cuts deep.
COOP111067
again. Oh
COOP111068
COOP111201
COOP111202
Leo-chan
COOP111203
Do you have a minute?
COOP111205
COOP111206
to spare
COOP111207
ever since that audition.
COOP111208
pretend like I haven't noticed.
COOP111209
encourage him
COOP111210
doesn't want that at all. I feel stuck.
COOP111211
COOP111212
just stopped tiptoeing around it?
COOP111214
stop myself from worrying about him.
COOP111215
something!
COOP111216
COOP111217
the meddling part at least.
COOP111218
place if I wasn't so worried.
COOP111219
feel about me getting so stressed over him?
COOP111221
COOP111222
me to shut up or go away.
COOP111223
COOP111224
COOP111226
your teeth before bed
COOP111401
COOP111402
second?
COOP111405
something!
COOP111406
moment
COOP111407
COOP111408
well have flushed it down the drain!
COOP111410
COOP111411
to do.
COOP111412
COOP111413
to do some thinking.
COOP111414
seniors from the training school that lives
nearby.
COOP111415
making me worry
COOP111417
I went and opened my big mouth.
COOP111418
tried keeping a positive attitude.
COOP111419
that he said he wanted to leave!
COOP111420
at me?
COOP111421
COOP111423
be a huge help.
COOP111424
another boy his own age.
COOP111425
{NAME2}-chan.
COOP111426
panic could just make things worse.
COOP111427
behind.
COOP111428
come back right away.
COOP111429
him. I'll worry about the future later.
COOP111430
to hear the news from Kayo-san.
COOP111431
be honest
COOP111432
about that audition.
COOP111433
acting.
COOP111434
to tell me to express more of myself in my
roles.
COOP111435
have their own emotions.
COOP111436
into a performance. Otherwise it'll be flat.
COOP111437
ever thought about acting like a cool hero.
COOP111438
boring and one-dimensional
this whole time.
COOP111439
in my life and my own feelings.
COOP111440
Everything else was just noise.
COOP111441
people who don't know about the films I love.
COOP111442
and started shutting everyone out.
COOP111443
but I thought I didn't have time to care.
COOP111444
COOP111445
without giving it a second thought.
COOP111446
probably worried sick about me right now.
COOP111447
Hah...
COOP111449
COOP111450
things?
COOP111451
looking for a reason to go back.
COOP111452
hoping someone would come get me.
COOP111453
like you're the real hero here.
COOP111454
crash. Can you wait a minute?
COOP111455
COOP111456
COOP111457
COOP111458
COOP111459
COOP111460
COOP111462
COOP111601
COOP111602
about to go shopping together.
COOP111603
dinner if you'd like to join.
COOP111605
COOP111606
you've done for us!
COOP111607
you're free
COOP111608
only get to pick one snack each
COOP111610
load up on sukiyaki beef!
COOP111611
COOP111612
doesn't it? And you're still a growing boy!
COOP111613
We'll demolish all of this no problem!
COOP111615
COOP111616
need to get started right away!
COOP111617
you two?
COOP111618
more before going back.
COOP111619
COOP111620
No shying out from dinner now!
COOP111622
getting along now.
COOP111623
COOP111625

COOP111637
COOP111638
COOP111639
people
myself.
COOP111640
being near people who fuss over me...
COOP111641
mooching off them.
COOP111642
It's super encouraging.
COOP111643
approving. But I think she's done enough.
COOP111644
my own form of expression.
COOP111645
montage. I think that's what's next for me.
COOP111647
Kayo-san to worry again.
COOP111648

COOP111649

COOP111650
Let's go eat some sukiyaki!

COOP111815
this is what the generation gap feels like.
COOP111816
COOP111817
odd
COOP111818
feel so fresh all of a sudden.
COOP111819
I had back then.
COOP111820
problems completely different than mine.
COOP111821
everyone's on the same page as you.
COOP111823
COOP111824
COOP111825
compliment?
COOP111826
long as I tried.
COOP111827
COOP111828
COOP111829
over
COOP111830
already having a hard time is bound to get
annoying.
COOP111831
him instead of panicking like I did.
COOP111833
should have told me then!
COOP111834
those lines and I just didn't catch it...
COOP111835
when it's really happening to you...
COOP111836
teach me
COOP111837
and things worked out well...
COOP111838
COOP111839
success is his own.
COOP111840
problems as if they're your own. But if
things go well for them...
COOP111841
Is that the kind of thing you learn with age?
COOP111842
bad after all.
COOP111843
time soon!
COOP111844
again
COOP111846
to our usual routine? My way of saying
thanks!
COOP111847
COOP111848
COOP111849
COOP111850
COOP111851
I need some advice on something!

COOP118284
You're just awful sometimes
player...
COOP118285
COOP118286

COOP118300
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP118301
COOP118302
COOP118303
dokey
COOP118304
another place in mind?
COOP118310
COOP118311
to learn more about what teens are into these
days.
COOP118313
figure out all on my own
COOP118315
some time
COOP118320
I want to say I was here all the time as
a kid.
COOP118321
latest trends. I'm glad that's stayed the
same.
COOP118322
though. I wonder if any of the shops I know
are still around.
COOP118324
sure they must exist
COOP118325
it ages... Just like what I'm trying to do!
COOP118326
COOP118327
more shops from way before the current
generation was even born.
COOP118328
my dose of youthful experience— ah
youthful inspiration!
COOP118329
Popcorn
COOP118331
Here one minute and gone the next!
COOP118332
Well
COOP118333
on anything that looks yummy along the way?
COOP118350
when I was younger!
COOP118351
I can't believe it's been so long since I was
last here.
COOP118352
someone closer to your own age
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP118354

COOP118355

COOP118356

COOP118357

COOP118358
rather hang out somewhere more fun than a
planetarium.
COOP118359
really into the stars or something.
COOP118361
tell me all about them?
COOP118362
expect too. There was this anime
COOP118369
tonight. Want to take a look at the sky?
COOP118380
like this these days?
COOP118381
more mature than we were back then
COOP118382

COOP118384
nothing to be proud of on its own...
COOP118385
have the... dignity that comes with age?
COOP118386
COOP118387
but I'll accept the compliment. Thank you!
COOP118388

COOP118389

COOP118450

COOP118469

COOP118451
don't go to the movies much either
COOP118453

COOP118454

COOP118455
COOP118456

COOP118457
Theaters are really changing with the times.
COOP118458
I was a kid. You know

COOP118460

anymore!
COOP118461
primary colors here! Never mind
don't know.
COOP118462
head to our seats.
COOP118470

your popularity skyrocket... right?

{NAME2}-chan's house!
COOP118507

{NAME2}-chan?
COOP118530
I'm surprised.

DS50004
my phone

DS50025
DS50026

DS50030
DS50031
stuff so I won't get lost.
DS50032
Sometimes I'll try a new location
of course...
DS50033
DS50034
laid-back...
DS50035
DS50036

DS51024
DS51025
DS51026
It'll be my treat!
DS51027
DS51028

DS51042
DS51043
good school.
DS51044
it's a nice place to go running...
DS51045
about running.
DS51046

DS51047
help but think how cool they look.
DS51048
DS51049
events open to the general public.
DS51050
competition aspect...
DS51051
with me.
DS51052
on TV
DS51053
thinking about wanting to be up there myself.
DS51054
to run with.
DS51055
DS51056
DS51057
DS51058
DS51059
DS51060

DS51094
DS51095

DS51096
to do is follow me.
DS51097
DS51098
long-distance races. It's also called
a "pacemaker".
DS51099
who can set the pace for the rest of
the runners.
DS51100
everyone can run with no worries.
DS51101
DS51102

DS51103
DS51104

DS54477

DS54479
I'm afraid he won't take it.
DS54480
DS54481

DS54482
Shota-kun could know the answer.

a simple geometry
puzzle
DS54497
hard enough for a college
entrance exam.
DS54498
off how smart she is?
DS54499

can solve these?
DS54501
DS54502
DS54503

DS54504
it out no matter what.
DS54505
be so hard then. Hm...
DS54506
DS54507
DS54508
DS54510
after another. The next
one is...
DS54511
DS54512
DS54513
puzzle
DS54514
And with a hint
DS54515
any less quick-thinking
than Haruna...
DS54516
DS54517
That's easy. It'd be...
DS54518
DS54519
a bronze statue near the diner?
DS54520
a hint for this one?

DS54535
DS54536
DS54537
DS54538
DS54539
in America
DS54540
to stay friends like this forever...
DS54541
DS54542
too! And that means I've gotta go far away...
DS54543
losing
DS54544
I go
Right?
DS54545
DS54546

DS54562
DS54563
DS54564

DS54565
DS54566

DS54567
DS54568

DS54570
Haruna and Shota.
DS55000

DS55001

DS55002
DS55003
Everything will work out if we get one more.
DS55004
rate
who walks by.
DS55005
to recruit members for a band.
DS55006
looks like they've got nothing better to do...
DS55007
DS55008
to do!
DS55009
together!
DS55010
got nothing better to do? Rude!
DS55011

DS55014
still participate in other
club activities...
DS55015
DS55016
DS55017
asking random people
first try!?
DS55018
pretty sudden after all.
DS55019
shy. We'd love to have you.
DS55020
enough members like this.
DS55021
rip-off when you actually listen to it.
DS55022
DS55023
DS55024
DS55025
DS55026
This is great!
DS55027
DS55028
change your mind.
DS55030
I play the keyboard.
DS55031
DS55032
DS55033
DS55034
We're short a bassist...
DS55035
{NAME2}-kun?
DS55036
DS55037
before you change your mind!
DS55038
get the papers ready and take them over
to the faculty office.
DS55039
Gotta tell Taiko the good news!
DS55050
our club
DS55051

DS55052
DS55053

DS55054
clubs too.
DS55055
never touched a bass in your life
DS55056
Drums.
DS55057
DS55058
I promise they're not usually like that.
DS55059
since we started high school.
DS55060
so she's pretty skilled.
DS55061
lack of experience.
DS55062
it personally. I'll cover for you where
I can.
DS55063
you joined our group!
DS55064
won awards.
DS55065
You know how I break under pressure.
DS55066

DS55069
Feel free to practice on it any time.
DS55070
notes. First...
DS55071
DS55072
DS55073
DS55074
DS55075
to ask...
DS55076
DS55077
DS55078
DS55079
DS55080
hard to keep it up all the time. Haha...
DS55081
errand girl. What a pain. Haha...
DS55082
come to me the moment they need something.
DS55083
you today.
DS55084
Okay
DS55085
DS55086
DS55087
we'll start with an easy song.
DS55090
first time?
DS55091
DS55092
but I've played piano since I was little.
DS55093
We had a piano at home
learned too.
DS55094
once I started high school and went to the
club fair...
DS55095
from back then have already graduated now.
DS55096
perform freely and full of joy the way
they do."
DS55097
keyboardist.
DS55098
about it though.
DS55099
DS55100
Despite being a beginner
really well.
DS55101
for today.
DS55102
own pace. I'm just happy you joined.
DS55110
DS55111
practice solo or as a duo.
DS55112
don't seem very into
it though...
DS55113
DS55114
DS55115
DS55116
DS55117
having trouble focusing.
DS55118
why Taiko's so antsy.
DS55119
DS55120
DS55121
about.
DS55122
practice together now?
DS55123
DS55124
DS55125
rookie mistake. My bad.
DS55126
I'm gonna head home early.
DS55127
you go?
DS55128
DS55129
your own for a bit.
DS55130
a band in middle school?
DS55131
freelance gigs.
DS55132
so apparently they asked Taiko to come back.
DS55133
really lost on what to do.
DS55134
as it is
to them.
DS55135
focus like this!
DS55136
to stop by the post office today!
DS55137
and the others I had an errand to run!
DS55138
DS55139
I wait for Ritsuka to
come back.
DS55140
DS55141
an errand.
DS55142
by yourself.
DS55143
what she's so hung up on...
DS55144
so I let her go home early.
DS55145
to rejoin must be what's
bothering her...
DS55146
Horikita told me.
DS55147
Taiko already refused the band's offer
though.
DS55148
club and not go back to her old band.
DS55149
DS55150
DS55151
No bad experiences
like that
DS55152
DS55153

DS55155

DS55156
What should I do?
DS55157
DS55158
DS55159
a hand!
DS55160
DS55161
surprised you.
DS55162
everything gets all jumbled up in your head?
DS55163
real loud like a hard reset.
DS55164
DS55165
DS55166
for today and clean up.
DS55167
together?
DS55168

DS55184
I misunderstood you this whole time.
DS55185

recruitment tactics either.
DS55187
DS55188
DS55189
you
DS55190
to perform in a competition.
DS55191
we would never be able to achieve our goal.
DS55192
before. It is an option to quit if you really
want to.
DS55193
DS55194
as a member of our club
DS55195
you must be motivated!
DS55196
DS55197

The whole club is more positive...
Cheerful even!

DS63056
like that with everyone...
DS63057
weight training! How about it? The gym is
empty around this time.
DS63058
Besides
lately even if I wanted to.
DS63059

DS63060
bad about taking some down time.

her muscles!
DS63082

Walking is one of the best exercises for
your muscles!
DS63092

DS63093
can you tell me what's troubling you?
DS63094
DS63095
DS63096
wanted to tell me something for a while now.
DS63097
terrified by what Anderson
just said...
DS63098
the voice of your muscles
DS63099
shoulder to lean on... How about we take
a break somewhere to—
DS63100
I only approached you... to swindle you!
DS63101
DS63102
health equipment at horrendous prices.
DS63103
DS63104
DS63105
so he told me to make you sign a contract.
DS63106
DS63107
my wages if I can't get a signature...
DS63108
like this anymore
transferred to another position.
DS63109

DS63110

DS63111

everything!

DS63121
DS63122
Don't you worry!

DS63131
my wonderful personal trainer by my side!
DS63132
out a big loan
DS63133
DS63134
notice she dropped this!
DS63135
This must be important to her.

her boss.
DS63137
you
DS63138
property from Anderson.
DS63139
theater in Shibuya. I should
go pay it a visit...
DS63140
Anderson the overpriced
fitness equipment...
DS63141
her must be her boss.
DS63142
It looks like she's pleading
to him with tears in her eyes.
DS63143
muscle! See? It went just as I said it would.
DS63144
promised
DS63145

DS63149

That's hilarious! Can I take a video?
DS63152
DS63153
have been fooled... I need to
talk to that woman.
DS63154
near the movie theater.
That must be the office...
DS63155
the woman to come
back out of the office...
DS63156
would be to enter the Mementos. Let's go.
DS63157
DS63158
DS63159

DS63161

DS63164
DS63165
I took them seriously

DS63172
DS63173

DS63176
DS63177
the training equipment
DS63178
a cooling-off period to cancel it without
telling her boss.
DS63179
back to her hometown. A wise move by the
sound of it.
DS63180
feelings to her since it was probably my
last chance...
DS63181
DS63182
things settle down. That's good enough for
now!
DS63183
DS63184
joy of her muscles through the phone.
DS63185
Now we can finally be healthy! they said...
DS63186
She sounded so full of life...
DS63187
DS63188
joyful about the way his
muscles are pumping...

DS63190

DS63195

DS63196
I'm so
DS63197
DS63198
DS63199
so much for bringing it to me!
DS63200
Tch
DS63201
DS63202
I was the one being swindled.
DS63203
Anderson-san's contract.
DS63204
Why would he give this back to me?
DS63205
DS63206
to me from the first time we spoke.
DS63207
pushed him to buy things he doesn't need.
DS63208
but nothing changed... I feel so stupid.
DS63209
trick him normally back in Zoshigaya...
DS63210
So I ended up confessing everything instead.
DS63211
anything. And that's why I feel so bad
about it now...
DS63212
ways in Zoshigaya?
DS63213
DS63214
DS63215
got this job. I haven't had the time to take
care of myself.
DS63216
DS63217
DS63218
DS63219
listen to all my silly problems.
DS63220
muscles... My body was trying to tell me what
to do
DS63221
to Anderson-san.
DS63222
Anderson-san's contract!
DS63223
cooling-off period... And the loan probably
hasn't even been processed yet.
DS63224
My boss will be so angry with me!
DS63225
DS63226
of advice
to do about Anderson...
DS63227
DS63228
Hahaha

DS63241
how to listen to my muscles.
DS63242
My abs beggin' me to "Turn that six-pack to an eight-pack!"
DS63243
every day into the specimen that stands
before you.
DS63244

DS64440

hidden more carefully.

 didn't happen to see a calico cat
DS64461
DS64462
here. He says she's a calico.
DS64463
while he was living in this part of the city.
DS64464
DS64465
tabby seems eager to see her again...
DS64466
DS64467
DS64468
tabby's friend?
DS64469
DS64470
DS64471
DS64472

young man.

DS64504
DS64505
DS64506
tabby's</color> friends?
DS64507
here a lot lately...
DS64508
that looks after stray cats
why he feels so comfortable here.
DS64509
make sure to be nice
DS64510
taking care of that cat...
DS64511
tabby hunting around for food
or something
DS64512
I should look around
for him...
DS64513
DS64514
DS64515
leftovers you could have. That sound good?
DS64516
for you.
DS64517
DS64518
DS64519
DS64520
DS64521
DS64522
DS64523

DS64549

subject
DS65001
really all I'm worth?
DS65002
DS65003
DS65004
DS65005
have a moment to talk?
DS65006
DS65007
DS65008
DS65009
motif is the concept of "change."
DS65010
DS65011
DS65012
change all over Shinjuku...
DS65013
shot I'm satisfied with. To be honest
in a bit of a slump.
DS65014
DS65015
understand.
DS65016
quite emblematic of "change."
DS65017
like I could try taking a few more photos.
DS65018
approach and getting a few shots of
Shinjuku's nighttime scenery.
DS65019
come along?
DS65020
DS65021
like someone to bounce ideas off of.
DS65022
DS65023
DS65024
could be a particularly invigorating
experience.
DS65025
won't make you stay out that late.
DS65026
worth your while. What do you think?
DS65027
DS65028
DS65029
I'll be waiting!
DS65030
taking up your time.
DS65031
DS65032
gets too late.
DS65033
definitely have this image of streets
glowing with neon...
DS65034
DS65035
DS65036
DS65037
DS65046
DS65047
come to.
DS65048
as a city just for adults
DS65049
come here too. There's all kinds of trendy
places around this area.
DS65050
as well. Look
DS65051
DS65052
DS65053
DS65054
Maybe that's what I've been looking for.
DS65055
seem like an adult...
DS65056
DS65057
In fact
opposite direction.
DS65058
photos
problem
DS65059
though
that atmosphere.
DS65060
DS65061
DS65062
DS65063
DS65064
DS65065
suit this scene.
DS65066
DS65067
DS65068
great.
DS65069
DS65070
let's put it all together!
DS65071
this way taking photos.
DS65072
appreciate it.
DS65073
guy about the photo I took.
DS65074
does
data.
DS65075
DS65076
his permission...
DS65077
so he's not visible...
DS65078
it
DS65079
and then upload them to my social media.
DS65080
helped me take some great shots.
DS65081
DS65082
DS65083
getting late
tomorrow. That okay with you?
DS65084
DS65085
have to get back to work now
be in touch.
DS65086
DS65087
DS65088
DS65089
able to come to Shinjuku right now?
DS65090
you about.
DS65091
DS65092
talk face-to-face.
DS65093
DS65094
with Shimizu...
DS65095
DS65096
would've turned out like this...
DS65097
for a moment there...
DS65098
DS65099
A lot of things happened...
DS65100
DS65101
DS65102
of sleep. I haven't really processed my
feelings yet.
DS65103
you mind if I rest for a bit?
DS65104
DS65106
to wake him up
strong tea...
DS65107
DS65108
DS65109
at least...
DS65110
much trouble.
DS65111
DS65112

DS65123
bed without even realizing what I'd done...
DS65124
of notifications on my phone.
DS65125
fairly popular young idol.
DS65126
would recognize him from any angle.
DS65127
their comments...
DS65128
DS65129
took this?" and "Don't invade an idol's
privacy!" That sort of thing...
DS65130
immediately and apologized in
the comments...
DS65131
already screenshotted it and were spreading
the picture around.
DS65132
DS65133
number of his fans seem to think it is.
DS65134
from him or his agency...
DS65135
careless. I really regret it.
DS65136
much trouble for you
DS65137
DS65138
wrong with taking the picture.
DS65139
After all this
DS65140
can throw a person's entire life into chaos.
DS65141
after all.
DS65142
from this whole ordeal.
DS65143
there were a few actual opinions on
the photo.
DS65144
DS65145
captured the feeling of modern Shinjuku...
DS65146
they understood why I wanted to take
his photo...
DS65147
The things I wanted to say really did
get across.
DS65148
isn't anything you need to worry about.
DS65149
DS65150
promised you.
DS65151

DS65253
DS65254
DS65255
DS65256
DS65257
DS65258
try out...
DS65259
out with it
name that came to mind.
DS65260
DS65261
DS65262
DS65263
DS65264
DS65265
time
DS65266
Central Street in Shibuya?
DS65267
DS65268
that way now too.
DS65269
DS65270
figured you'd probably be willing to
help me out.
DS65271
DS65272
DS65273
DS65274
and caused all that outrage
disaster.
DS65275
did give me some good motivation.
DS65276
that will resonate with people a bit more.

people on the street about them.
DS65291
take photos at the end.
DS65292
DS65293
DS65294
to people unfamiliar with the medium.
DS65295
also take a video to discuss what I wanted
to communicate about the motif.
DS65296
DS65297
act as my advisor...
DS65298
Feel free to be proactive in throwing
out ideas.
DS65299
change. More than I could ever imagine
on my own.
DS65300
out again?
DS65301
DS65302
DS65303
let's head out and start shooting right away.
DS65304
DS65305
over by Shibuya Crossing.
DS65306
we should decide on our first topic.
DS65307
What's your favorite food?
DS65308
DS65309
DS65310
have that magnificent
that I'm after.
DS65311
be best?
DS65312
DS65313
DS65314
DS65315
phrase it as
experienced recently?"
DS65316
inspire some good responses.
DS65317
will understand the theme better.
DS65318
DS65319
begin the interviews.
DS65320
like a TV crew...
DS65321
DS65322
DS65323
making a video.
DS65324
DS65325
back
trouble shooting videos in public...
DS65326
internet laughingstock!?
DS65327
DS65328
DS65329
DS65330
entered the workforce
to mess around like this.
DS65331
to the office.
DS65332
out of nowhere.
DS65333
DS65334
snapshots
DS65335
response to unsolicited interactions
like that.
DS65336
DS65337
DS65338
shake it off and find the next subject.
DS65339
on video?
DS65340
off-limits!
DS65341
are you?
DS65342
DS65343
if my mom saw this.
DS65344
going to the arcade.
DS65345
DS65346
DS65347
DS65348
DS65349
DS65350
DS65351
DS65352
really interested in that interview anyway.
DS65353
so I could talk to you!
DS65354
DS65355
as bad as the first person.
DS65356
DS65357
huge help.
DS65358
looks like they'd really be willing
to talk...
DS65359
DS65360
allowed to be that rude to us...
DS65361
DS65362
DS65363
Sounds like fun!
DS65364
DS65365
the time!
DS65366
the shop
DS65367
DS65368
DS65369
DS65370
DS65371
DS65372
DS65373

DS65374

DS65376
DS65377
DS65378
recently
DS65379
DS65380
DS65381
DS65382
we split...
DS65383
me right up!
DS65384
way happier than any guy I've ever met!
DS65385
to marry these crêpes!
DS65386
crêpe shop girl! Wasn't it a great story?
DS65387
DS65388
DS65389
that girl at the crêpe shop.
DS65390
DS65391
forward to seeing her video and photo
at least.
DS65392
If I hurry
it by tonight.
DS65393
to get many views right away...
DS65394
memorable first step.
DS65395
It's probably about the
interview video...
DS65396
DS65397
DS65398
and bad news.
DS65399
DS65400
DS65401
video got a fair amount of buzz.
DS65402
I was worried I'd started another outrage.
DS65403
motif of "change
the crêpes
DS65409
DS65410
DS65411
DS65412
took all the attention.
DS65413
positive reactions.
DS65414
DS65415
continue with this project.
DS65416
video without your support.
DS65417
would bring about
DS65418
after all.
DS65419

DS600073
You have very good luck!
DS600074
no matter what you do today.
DS600075
DS600076
It seems that many unexpected things could
happen to you today.
DS600077
to sleep tonight.
DS600078
fortune reading?
DS600079
want your fortune read again!
DS610001
I do?
DS610002
terribly important...
DS610003
DS610004
I heard they've started selling a new
dessert.
DS610005
program. It seems it's only available for a
limited amount of time.
DS610006
happy to have made it to the shop without
issue but...
DS610007
they're all so young.
DS610008
here as a little old lady all by myself.
DS610009
no one was free to meet today.
DS610010
I can go in with confidence.
DS610011
DS610012
DS610013
It's on me.
DS610014
treated me to the shop's
newest dessert.
DS610015
DS610016
DS610017
and pastries...
DS610018
DS610019
I hate it. It's very embarrassing.
DS610020
DS610021
DS610022
handsome young man.
DS610023
the longer you live
luck improves.
DS610024
an old lady like me.
DS610025

DS610026
shops in this area.
DS610027
DS610028
it to my friends.
DS610029
DS610040
my way to the bookstore.
DS610041
looking for. I'm just passing the time.
DS610042
Shinjuku's bookstore. I always find myself
going there.
DS610043
{NAME1}-san?
DS610044
DS610045
Or perhaps you're looking for comic books
and novels?
DS610046
accompany me to the bookstore?
DS610047
reading these days.
DS610048
DS610049
special new friend.
DS610050

DS610051
browsing the books together.
DS610052
DS610053
the academic section.
DS610054
DS610055
DS610056
while flipping through the pages.
DS610057
use some of it in my next exhibition.
DS610058
calligraphy classes as well.
DS610059
can't soak it all in in one day
DS610060
the meaning
DS610061
learn something new.
DS610062
DS610063
DS610064
gain from study and books is
incredibly valuable.
DS610065
a full-time student you must know that better
than anyone.
DS610066
DS610067
keep advice from sounding preachy.
DS610068
reclaim the time they lost making mistakes
by giving it back to others.
DS610069
DS610070
an ear
DS610071
wonderful time.
DS610072
time. Until then
DS610080
just about to take a short break.
DS610081
DS610082
DS610083
DS610084
always makes me feel energized.
DS610085
a slow walker.
DS610086
avoid blocking people that are in a rush.
DS610087
You see a lot of interesting things.
DS610088
end up overhearing young people's
conversations.
DS610089
sure I've heard them use slang words.
DS610090
make heads or tails of it...

interested in trying to figure out their
meaning by listening to conversations.
DS610092
DS610093
street to ask what they mean.
DS610094
DS610095
know their meaning.
DS610096
these words?
DS610097
DS610098
DS610099
DS610100
words either
for me.
DS610101
phrases like this...
DS610102
words she wants to know.
DS610103
as simply as I could.
DS610104
DS610105
you teach me the words of your generation.
DS610106
away your ego and willingly learn
from others.
DS610107
taught me next time.
DS610108
I should be heading home.
DS610109
Goodbye
DS610200
DS610201
DS610202
DS610203
DS610204
DS610205
DS610206
me to follow him...
DS610207
DS610208
lined up... These must be the
tabby's treasures.
DS610209
DS610210
one for myself?
DS610211
DS610212
DS610213
DS610214
DS610215
didn't want to part with it.
DS610216
DS610217
DS610218
I guess I should follow him...
DS610219
DS610220
okay to take one?
DS610221
DS610222
DS610223
DS610224
right choice?
DS610225
DS610226
DS610227
DS610228
give me...
DS610229
orange tabby if I have
the time.
DS610400
DS610401
teary-eyed...
DS610402
DS610403
is something bothering me...
DS610404
DS610405
DS610406
say that.
DS610407
quite difficult to say actually.
DS610408
lost my staff ID card...
DS610409
technically lost... yet! If I find it
won't be an issue
DS610410
my ID.
DS610411

DS610414

DS610429
DS610430
DS610431
and cruel remarks...
DS610432
without worry.
DS610433
so much again.
DS611000
more photos?
DS611001
Maybe it's because you're here...
DS611002
DS611003
DS611004
is wrong.
DS611005
that. Everyone's completely losing it.
DS611006

stranger and stranger.
DS611012

DS611013
sensitive to shifts in the
town's atmosphere...
DS611014
that's magnificent and exquisite.
DS611015

DS611023

DS611024

DS611025
I'm very lucky to have met you
DS611026
DS611027
back to the photos.
DS611028
DS611029

DS612007
A new training method!
DS612008
They're screamin' for that pump!
DS612009
He's the best bodybuilder out there!
DS612010
but he also talks about his daily routine.
DS612011

DS612012
on my cheat days!
DS612013
Can't wait to find out!
DS612014

DS612015

DS612016
DS612017

DS612018
My hands are sweatin' just turnin' the page!
DS612019

DS612020

DS612021
Wanna put it to the test?
DS612022

DS612037

DS612038

DS612039

DS612041
For example

DS612042
my customers eat...
DS612043
But that's not all...
DS612044

DS612045

DS612050
DS612051
DS612052
Wanna come with?
DS612053
protein. Which one are you feelin' today?
DS612054
DS612055

DS612056
DS612057
and easy to access on the go.
DS612058
on calcium and other essential vitamins.
DS612059
to choose based on the situation.
DS612060
Give it a try sometime!
DS612061

DS612062
or feelin' sick. Always good to have some
on hand.
DS612063
flavors. Makes it hard to get tired of.
DS612064
tend to be lacking in flavor
DS612065
so I try to stock up then.
DS612066
recommendations next time?
DS612067
about gains like we are
of dietary restrictions.
DS612068
protein bars are there to save the day!
DS612069
to choose from too.
DS612070
I find the texture very satisfying.
DS612071
Perfect when you're only a little hungry.

Gotta keep the taste interesting so you

You really know what you're doin'.
DS612157

veggie of choice!
DS612158

DS612159
the nutrients can't escape.
DS612160
control the precise amount of heat
have to be careful!
DS612161
DS612162
These pure egg whites are bound to turn in
to pure muscle.
DS612163
The saltiness adds a nice flavor.
DS612164
it looks a bit... white. But you know
it's more uniform that way!
DS612165
regular omelette. Go on
DS612166
DS612167

DS612168

I'm sure you have experienced a

Let's make good use of these.
GQ5510001

GQ5510017
GQ5510018
Let's investigate.
GQ5510019
Hurry and catch them!
GQ5510020
catch them if we cross paths again.
GQ5520001
Whirlwinds we've encountered.
GQ5520002
Perhaps...
GQ5520003
GQ5520004
keen eye.
GQ5520005
let's pass through it and see what happens.
GQ5520006
GQ5520007
the Whirlwinds
and convenient.
GQ5520008
We can make use of these to rapidly increase

that that we were able to get in. We should
consider it serendipitous.
GQ8511110

GQ8511111
Should we see what it does?
GQ8511112

GQ8511150
What's that device he's operating...?
GQ8511151
Alright
GQ8511152
GQ8511155
command that Shadow used earlier.
GQ8511156
we do?
GQ8511157

GQ8511158
GQ8511159
a demonstration would be sufficient. Wonder
try using it now.
GQ8511165
GQ8511166
GQ8511167
should be sure to use them. Don't forget that
operation command!
GQ8511170

by the Palace ruler's perceptions...
it would seem.
GQ8511187
we don't have to worry about them attacking us?

But do be careful not to provoke any

GQ8511279
boys take the lead!
GQ8511280
GQ8511281
GQ8511282
We can't enter through here. We'll have to

the shields and weapons for now.
GQ41161001

GQ41043013
there may be new tricks to it this time...

may be able to spot something?

GQ41043018
even goes?
GQ41043019
GQ41043020

GQ41043021
We'll need to learn the order from somewhere.
GQ41043022

GQ41043023
GQ41043024
GQ41043025
GQ41043026

GQ41061020
the one called "Panther" may be over there.

GQ41113028
don't stop those scythes first...
GQ41113029
That round thing on the wall looks familiar.
GQ41113030
Kiuchi's Palace! It disabled the trap!
GQ41113031
put them in the holes.
GQ41113032
messing with this device too!
GQ41113033
GQ41113034
we need the same number of balls?
GQ41113035

GQ42172003
the wall!
GQ42172004
this as a pathway.

about it seems different from the others...
GQ42181001
so simple after all.
GQ42181002
engage in combat.
GQ42191001
That must mean we beat this area
GQ42191002
the vault's entrance as soon as we check its

GQ42191004
let's return to the bank entrance.
GQ42201002

The core is right in front of your eyes.

not pass through it

GQ42182003
Although I'm also quite interested in those
two empty frames over there...
GQ42182004
keep going
GQ42081001
GQ42081002
somewhere. Let's search for it.
GQ42081003
something around this painting...

the other areas around here.
GQ42021002
GQ42021003
GQ42021004
doing here?
GQ42021005
too. Does this place have somethin' to do
with Miyazawa?
GQ42021006
sure just yet... At any rate
investigate those cameras first.
GQ42021007
is hidden behind this painting.
GQ42021008
Stay vigilant

here. I'm not sure what it does
but should I press it?

Let's see what's inside

GQ42031001
start our search from the first floor

guards to our presence.
GQ42031005
seem to be any way around them...
GQ42031006
take a look around.
GQ42031007
pass through safely now.
GQ42031008
GQ42031009
onwards now.
GQ42031010
GQ42031011

Could there be a hint nearby?
GQ42121015
Well done
GQ42121016
GQ42121017
a switch like the one just now.
GQ42121018
GQ42121019
GQ42121020
GQ42121021
in the same way.
GQ42121022
GQ42121023
GQ42121025
counterfeit.
GQ42121026
GQ42131001
haven't we searched...?
GQ42131003
elevators guarded!
GQ42131004
GQ42131005
GQ42131006
to have to find the device that
controls the elevators now.
GQ42131007
We still gotta move carefully so
we're not spotted.
GQ42131008
passage...
GQ42131009
two mechanisms over there.
GQ42131010
around. The rest is up to you
GQ42131011
investigation!
GQ42131012
Let's see if we can find some sort of
switch nearby.
GQ42131013
GQ42131014
Let us return to the elevator.
GQ42131015
GQ42131016
down to the basement.
GQ42131017
Are you prepared
GQ42131019
GQ42131020
work of them
GQ42141001
GQ42141002
GQ42141003
GQ42141004
larger than I imagined.
GQ42141005
begin by checking the area around us.
GQ42141006
caution.
GQ42141008
GQ42141010
field of view
GQ42141011
GQ42141014
Let's take a look.
GQ42141015
at the device over there first.
GQ42141016
for some kind of device?
GQ42141017
Couldn't this be the power source
for the surveillance cameras?
GQ42141018
GQ42141019
GQ42141020
security cameras now.
GQ42141021
GQ42141022
GQ42141023
GQ42141024
GQ42141025
Shall we look for another way?
GQ42141027
GQ42141029
GQ42141030
already.
GQ42141031
GQ42141032
Let's proceed
GQ42141033
GQ42141034
Let's go!
GQ42141035
GQ42141036
GQ42141037
be able to use this somewhere nearby.
GQ42141038
a try.
GQ42141039
GQ42141040
It seems well worth a try.
GQ42141041
surveillance cameras now.
GQ42141042
GQ42141043
You require immediate removal!
GQ42141044
GQ42141045
has appeared.
GQ42141046
GQ42151001
be blocked.
GQ42151003
What a bothersome location.
GQ42151004
Come on
GQ42151005
GQ42151006
by any of the surveillance cameras.
GQ42151007
GQ42151008
GQ42151009
Let's scout around this area.
GQ42151010
Impressive as always
GQ42151011
GQ42151012
inside of here.
GQ42151013
GQ42151015
GQ42161001
GQ42161003
Nevermind. Heading underground comes first.
GQ42161004
hint about how to turn it off nearby.
GQ42161005
harmless. Excellent job
GQ42161006
GQ42161007
of that ventilation shaft. Why don't we try
taking a look?
GQ42161008
something here.
GQ42161009
GQ42161010
Perhaps there's a hint involving the
electrical box on the wall.
GQ42161011
GQ42161012
We'll need to proceed with caution.
GQ42161013
and continue our infiltration!
GQ42161014
You truly are the embodiment
of a Phantom Thief... Heh.
GQ42161015
seem different from ones we've encountered
thus far.
GQ42161016
an electrical box nearby
GQ42161017
Something's blinking on and off
GQ42161018
GQ42161019
Let us time our movements precisely
for when they are turned off.
GQ42161021
in somewhere.
GQ42161022
GQ42162001
guarded by Shadows.
GQ42162003
GQ42162004
security guards doing!?
GQ42162005
GQ42162006
Let's go
GQ42162007
more thorough going forward. Be on high
alert as we continue.
GQ42172005
there are quite a lot of Shadows here.
GQ42172006
a treasure chest. It's our duty as Phantom
Thieves to push on.
GQ42172007
GQ42172008
GQ42172010
We'll need to find and destroy those
as well.
GQ42172011
Won't you take a look
GQ42172012
GQ42172029
GQ42172016
room back there!
GQ42172017
GQ42172018
have been disabled. Well done
GQ42172019
seem to be on rather high alert.
GQ42172020
first. Is there an electrical box nearby?
GQ42172021
GQ42172022
system. We should be able to
proceed now.
GQ42172023
the area
GQ42172024
GQ42172025
Let's start by taking a close look at the
room over there.
GQ42172026
there are other similar devices.
GQ42172028
disarmed now. Well done.
GQ42181003
Wonder.
GQ42181006
Better make sure not to fall.
GQ42181007
destroy the nearby electrical box.
GQ42181008
Shadow just beyond this door.
GQ42181009
to push on?
GQ42181013
guarded is this place anyway?
GQ42181014
heavier the further we go. But we must
push on.
GQ42181015
and keep our eyes peeled for any hints.
GQ42181016
GQ42181017
GQ42181010
all the traps and security cameras now.
GQ42191007
I'm gonna be dizzy.
GQ42191005
Stay focused
GQ42191008
on for...?
GQ42191009
GQ42191010
GQ42191011
let's find and destroy them all.
GQ42191013
electrical box.
GQ42191014
Are you prepared to move ahead?
GQ42191015
you're ready!
GQ42191016
GQ42191017
the next electrical box.
GQ42191018
GQ42191019
We ought to assume that it's quite powerful.
GQ42191021
GQ42191022
GQ42191024
avoid it all.
GQ42191025
to head over there for now to disarm
the traps.
GQ42191026
GQ42191027
destroy the electrical box.

to me too.
LD00126
heretofore unknown to us.
LD00127
see at a school.
LD00128
on making nationals!" or whatever.
LD00129
Palace may have changed
LD00130
utmost importance. Danger is surely
afoot.
LD00131
Phantom Thieves attire is proof that
we're unwelcome guests here.
LD00132
LD00133
LD00134
be correct. Fortunately the exit is in sight—
LD00135
LD00136
seems to be at work.
LD00137
trapped here!?
LD00138
choice but to find another way to escape.
LD00140
LD00141
see if we can find an entrance.
LD00142
If this is somebody's Palace...
LD00143
ought to allow us to escape.
LD00144
stealing Kiuchi's Treasure or something?
LD00145
means less nerves when it matters
LD00146
not let our guards down. Who can say if we'll
even be able to find a way inside...
LD00147
LD00149
a highly fortified stronghold would just
welcome thieves inside.
LD00150
infiltrated this place before us...
LD00151
cautious.
LD00176
LD00177
LD00170
LD00171
been the ones to unlock the gate.
LD00172
They're struggling against the Shadows too.
LD00173
LD00175
Allow me to handle things here!
LD00190
LD00191
LD00192
LD00193
LD00210
there. I'm Ryuji Sakam—
LD00211
give your real name to some total stranger!?
LD00212
LD00213
LD00214
LD00215
LD00216
LD00217
a friend of mine.
LD00218
LD00219
LD00220
LD00221
LD00222
afar
LD00223
the hell're you supposed to be anyway!?
LD00224
something?
LD00225
My name's Cattle!
LD00226
weren't sure what he was at first.
LD00227
either. I guess some creatures naturally
have googly eyes.
LD00228
me in with this guy!
LD00229
begin to think of me and that sorry excuse
for a cat as one and the same!
LD00231
LD00232
again
more fitting.
LD00233
cute side when compared to my stately
appearance.
LD00234
LD00235
flatter me. Very well
high esteem.
LD00236
describes me! Of course cute isn't really me.
LD00237
I'll say that much.
LD00238
compared to the likes of him.
LD00239
thanks for the compliment.
LD00240
LD00241
LD00242
up in this place
LD00243
In case you haven't realized
just met each other!
LD00244
saved our butts just now.
LD00245
LD00246
looking for a way to escape.
LD00247
sharing information here
LD00248
anyway.
LD00249
to these people... If they are both people.
LD00250
LD00251
both just as in the dark as each other.
LD00252
but then...
LD00253
LD00254
LD00255
LD00256
with us.
LD00257
and entered the castle...
LD00258
Shadows and got split from our friends in
the chaos.
LD00259
LD00260
to regroup
guys again.
LD00261
LD00262
LD00263
So we might've come here by accident
LD00264
LD00266
something...
LD00267
means securing it may be the key to our
escape.
LD00268
you interrupting me like that for!?
LD00269
worm.
LD00270
Treasure?
LD00271
know this castle's ruler.
LD00272
some degree.
LD00273
LD00274
LD00275
to paint over his portrait like that...
LD00276
<color=#FF423F>Kamoshida's</color> Palace
real deal.
LD00277
you're saying this place...
LD00278
but also has its differences?
LD00279
your shoulders
LD00280
I'm Motoh... Er
LD00281
gets the formalities out of the way!
LD00282
away our code names and goals to complete
strangers...
LD00283
we go look for this Treasure-like thing
together?
LD00284
still have two friends to find.
LD00286
LD00287
us out
LD00288
honor among thieves.
LD00289
castle
battle!
LD00290
to achieve both our goals!
LD00291
LD00292
about this "Treasure-like thing"?
LD00293
How about we give it a name?
LD00294
LD00296
a <color=#FF423F>Core</color>? For the time being
LD00297
thing! You're not bad
LD00298
especially not some fake feline!
LD00299
for it! From now on
a Core!
LD00300
Skull and Mona's friends. Let's go!
LD00810
first hall at Kamoshida's Palace
LD00811
us out at.
LD00812
LD00813
shadows and got the crap beat out of us.
LD00814
LD00815
time
away instead.
LD00816
pisses me off!
LD00817
at times like this
LD00819
body does a lot to clear up your mind.
LD00820
LD00821
guys to be jocks.
LD00822
relief activity with friends!
LD00823
LD00824
my lead. When it comes to fitness
LD00825
enough room for some quick sprints.
LD00826
LD00828
take a load off your mind. C'mon!
LD00829
but to run now.
LD00830
out there!
LD00831
not the ones running!
LD00832
no way I'm losing!
LD00850
remotely appealing.
LD00851
how its twisted ruler sees the world?
LD00852
pretty odd too... it was a weird stadium.
LD00853
shaped this place into a similarly vulgar
state.
LD00854
in reality
desires inspired this...
LD00855
out of here ASAP.
LD00856
would be like.
LD00857
LD00858
something pretty... something cool...
with Lady Ann there too...
LD00859
LD00860
idle chat! We gotta hurry on ahead!
LD00861
LD00862
LD00880
Kiuchi's palace. It's like Shadows could
leap out from anywhere...
LD00881
straight-up ghosts in this place...
LD00882
of seem like one of those carnival
haunted houses...
LD00883
LD00885
LD00886
focus on the task at hand!
LD00887
LD00888
are professionals at infiltration!
Yelling is...!
LD00320
LD00321
LD00322
LD00323
took me away... Who are those guys?
LD00325
LD00326
LD00340
LD00341
those people?
LD00343
thieves. It's reassuring to know that there
are more of us out there.
LD00344
LD00345
LD00346
person puts a teenage girl in a place
like this!?
LD00347
than being tied up and hurt
LD00348
LD00349
LD00350
of complications would lead to that.
LD00351
LD00352
LD00353
maybe he's looking for us too.
LD00354
him just sitting still.
LD00355
must be really strong!
LD00356
Versatile
LD00357
relying on. I guess you could call him
our leader.
LD00358
LD00359
two of you are alike.
LD00360
Wonder
LD00361
LD00363
two be twins or something?
LD00364
be nice to find Joker already.
LD00365
LD00366
my cool when he's not around...
LD00367
then snatch the Core!
LD00900
me out...
LD00901
damp and gross all around.
LD00902
he doesn't like in a dark cell underground.
LD00903
place.
LD00904
he had... Ugh.
LD00905
a human with rather fine taste.
LD00906
LD00907
remotely positive about that horrible fiend!?
LD00908
LD00909
LD00910
LD00911
LD00912
intelligence here!?
LD00930
LD00931
tied up
LD00932
another me here wearing a skimpy swimsuit...
LD00933
LD00934
LD00935
fellow saw as his ideal version of you.
LD00936
light in real life.
LD00937
LD00938
as his little playthings.
LD00939
works at a school!? Now it's our turn to
teach him a lesson!
LD00941
and make him apologize for everything!
LD00942
away... Mona
LD00943
LD00944
You know we're in public
LD00945
Mrrreow...
LD00946
In any case
LD00380
Training Hall of Love my ass.
LD00382
help them!
LD00383
beings
LD00384
just seeing them is hard to take.
LD00385
to such twisted cognition?
LD00386
teacher more disgusting than Kamoshida.
LD00387
coaches and... Wait
LD00388
they?
LD00389
LD00390
LD00391
just told you? Those are cognitive beings
who—
LD00392
to her!?
LD00393
badly in real life...
LD00394
LD00395
punk shoved her onto the train tracks.
LD00396
that's why she can no longer play baseball
her favorite game...
LD00397
Kiuchi has a change of heart!
LD00398
LD00399
of my best friends too. It was all Kamoshida's
doing.
LD00400
him have a change of heart. For Shiho's sake!
LD00401
LD00402
For our friends!
LD00403
We'll just have to cut that rot out!
LD00404
gonna have to do is find our way outta
this place.
LD00405
but I doubt it's this Kiuchi guy's either.
LD00406
to Kiuchi be in a place linked to Kamoshida?
LD00407
answer to that?
LD00408
Kiuchi's either... then where are we?
LD00409
dilly-dally.
LD00410
LD00420
LD00421
LD00422
LD00423
They'll just wear us down at this rate!
LD00424
steam myself!
LD00426
can fend off on your own—
LD00427
LD00428
LD00429
LD00431
LD00433
LD00440
LD00460
two were reading each other's minds!
LD00461
LD00462
LD00464
LD00465
Joker.
LD00466
a unit. I finally feel like things're gonna
be okay now!
LD00467
Wonder were to disappear on us.
LD00468
body language...
LD00469
LD00470
right?
LD00471
be found. If we just head there and
take it...
LD00472
LD00473
LD00474
here. Of course I'm gonna steal the
spotlight!
LD00475
LD00476
right back when the opportunity arises.
LD00477
LD00478
along
LD00479
LD00480
LD00481
find that Core!
LD00630
Is this... a baseball?
LD00631
gimmicks that involved balls too.
LD00632
Kiuchi's Palace.
LD00633
allowing us to proceed.
LD00634
LD00650
LD00651
LD00652
we need the same number of balls?
LD00653
find the remaining two balls.
LD00670
LD00671
LD00672
I'd kind of like a little break myself.
LD00673
the <color=#FF423F>chief's</color> coffee and curry...
LD00674
LD00675
coffee and curry?
LD00676
I ain't a cat!
LD00677
of a café.
LD00678
crashes... Have you heard of <color=#FF423F>Café Leblanc</color>
in Yongen?
LD00680
are super tasty!
LD00681
LD00682
LD00683
where a Phantom Thief lives?
LD00684
We wouldn't be here right now if it weren't
for them!
LD00685
LD00686
identities as phantom thieves a secret
okay?
LD00687
LD00711
entirely about Kiuchi's life!
LD00712
LD00713
our possession
LD00731
for the opposite sex and a desire to suppress
them.
LD00732
Tomoko's
LD00733
Yet it's in this makeshift version of
Kamoshida's Palace?
LD00734
hold onto it for safekeeping.
LD00751
target vulnerable girls!
LD00753
take this with us just in case.
LD00770
like we're in a detective novel or something!
LD00771
LD00772
let's go get it!
LD00790
LD00791
LD00792
LD00793
first one!
LD00794
regenerating as long as the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> is
still intact.
LD00795
prevent the shield from coming back.
LD00796
need it to get out of this place?
LD00797
restraint when you attack it.
LD00798
LD00799
Let's do this already!
LD00500
right?
LD00501
intruders for breakfast!
LD00502
I don't know if it's a Shadow or not
LD00503
And I'm not just talking about how it looks.
LD00504
LD00505
LD00506
LD00508
him into a frenzy.
LD00509
Core
LD00510
LD00511
LD00512
LD00513
LD00514
wearing that weird hood!?
LD00515
is hip! With it! The bee's knees!
LD00516
LD00517
LD00518
is to take that thing out and get the Core
right?
LD00519
LD00521
LD00530
LD00531
LD00532
my heart...
LD00533
LD00534
Core. I'd say it's time to go all out!
LD00550
LD00551
awfully familiar... But maybe it's my
imagination?
LD00552
everyone's still okay.
LD00553
LD00554
LD00555
LD00556
shape. It's only natural for it to collapse
now.
LD00557
LD00558
up
LD00570
LD00571
LD00572
castle crumbled.
LD00573
was preventing our escape seems to have
dissipated.
LD00574
collapse as well. We should leave at once.
LD00575
goodbye to Panther and the others?
LD00576
LD00577
LD00578
LD00579
you can do it.
LD00580
LD00581
became friends is kinda sad.
LD00582
if our Meta-Navs go on the fritz some more.
LD00583
LD00584
again.
LD00585
LD00586
long goodbyes here!
LD00587
place collapses!
LD00588
are in perfect sync.
LD00589
LD00591
LD00610
do again?
LD00611
infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today
LD00612
stronger
Treasure soon.
LD00613
LD00614
sake too!
LD00616
overcome by a bout of melancholia.
LD00618
More
LD00619
to have gotten stronger.
LD00620
LD00621
LD00622
<color=#FF423F>Core</color>'s on his head?
LD00623
the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> first.
LD00624
You'll pay for this!
LD00625
Everyone
LD00955
LD00960
LD00961
I don't want to drag you guys down...
LD00962
sidelines.
LD00963
too seriously! Oh wait...
LD00964
That actually gets me kinda hype!
LD00965
yourself
LD00966
You may call me Lufel-sensei.
LD00967
teacher
LD00968
Well
LD00969
LD00990
LD00991
Something has clearly gone awry.
LD00992
How about you
LD00994
sense of familiarity.
LD00995
An imitation of a Palace belonging to a
man called Kamoshida
LD00996
LD00997
answer to that myself.
LD00998
to a man known as Kamoshida.
LD00999
LD01000
answer to that myself.
LD01001
it's Closer when we're in the Metaverse.
LD01002
How could it have taken me so long to
notice?
LD01003
this place?
LD01004
here. I can't imagine she's been left behind.
LD01005
separated from the group and ended up in
a different part of the Metaverse.
LD01007
ought to begin by finding her.
LD01008
We don't even know where we are.
LD01009
this Palace's Core will allow us to escape.
LD01010
memories upon arrival...
LD01011
have come to this world as well.
LD01012
LD01014
you're talking about...
LD01015
came to a place resembling the Palace of a
man named Kamoshida?
LD01016
LD01017
companion that one would hesitate to
call human...
LD01018
a hooded goblin with them too?
LD01019
don't call me a hooded goblin!
LD01020
LD01021
already.
LD01022
if we can get outta here normally before we
do anything?
LD01023
giving it a try would be worthwhile.
LD01024
LD01025
LD01026
steal the Palace's Core like before.
LD01027
there is this Palace we're looking for?
LD01028
beat us inside...
LD01029
being Phantom Thieves.
LD01031
aside from that quasi-cat.
LD01032
LD01033
you two vouch for 'em.
LD01034
seemed to have... strong convictions.
LD01035
I like people like that.
LD01036
building.
LD01037
we are not the first visitors.
LD01038
LD01050
LD01051
I have fallen for something so simple...
LD01052
LD01053
LD01054
LD01055
LD01057
LD01070
LD01071
assist Wonder!
LD01072
LD01073
LD01074
LD01090
of that one. You okay
LD01092
favor.
LD01093
me last time!
LD01094
Something about you does resemble Joker.
LD01095
count on him!
LD01096
your way in here as well. I knew it.
LD01097
LD01098
LD01099
he's that different from Mona
LD01100
LD01101
associate me with that detestable creature!
LD01102
conversation's happened.
LD01103
Or are they an accessory of sorts?
LD01104
sketch you for a bit?
LD01105
LD01106
LD01107
Panther.
LD01108
LD01109
artist as I endeavor to elevate my craft.
LD01110
could say I'm pursuing a chef's path
LD01111
LD01112
LD01113
gig for reasons I won't get into
LD01114
overjoyed to hear you're a ramen chef.
LD01115
on your side as well.
LD01116
making me rather famished. I've had nothing
but warm water all day.
LD01117
always hungry?
LD01118
you're hungry
LD01119
As thanks for saving Wonder.
LD01120
LD01121
LD01122
LD01123
separated as well?
LD01124
where's Closer? Is she missing?
LD01125
but we are uncertain of her current
whereabouts.
LD01126
LD01127
then. Let's team up to find our friends.
LD01128
depends on if we can find the Core
surely won't be an easy feat.
LD01129
LD01131
go. Not to mention... thing's aren't looking
good for us.
LD01132
and Joker. That's four of our allies.
LD01133
our ranks.
LD01134
then begin our search for the Core.
LD01135
we're looking for them
it up.
LD01136
could work
LD01137
It seems safer to have strength in numbers.
LD01138
worry about the others who are missing.
LD01139
find them while we're looking for the Core.
LD01140
the details...
LD01141
four missing comrades on our side.
LD01142
All right
LD01143
before we get going...
LD01144
with all of you.
LD01145
LD01146
LD01147
LD01148
happened before.
LD01149
to steal both to get outta here?
LD01150
is a very likely possibility.
LD01151
something like that
LD01152
Treasures; thus I can sense them as well.
LD01153
to sense Cores as well?
LD01154
about Treasures. Couldn't tell you why
LD01155
not important now
LD01156
closest Core and pick up our missing allies
along the way.
LD01157
LD01158
LD01159
LD01170
LD01171
know. Take these paintings... they're not
like before.
LD01172
LD01173
mentor... An artist called Ichiryusai
Madarame.
LD01174
change of heart... by taking his Treasure.
LD01175
we had done so.
LD01176
has already collapsed? And what makes it
different?
LD01177
portraits of his pupils suffering under him.
Like me.
LD01178
LD01179
he saw his pupils as his own blank canvases
then...
LD01180
of him. Unfortunately
even more insignificant than that.
LD01181
don't need to talk about this if you don't
want to.
LD01182
The matter has been resolved.
LD01183
Madarame took me in. Consequently
deeply indebted to him.
LD01184
other students as mere tools.
LD01185
All to gain fame and wealth.
LD01186
opposite of Pops at Heritage Kitchen...
LD01187
heart
truth.
LD01188
in the Phantom Thieves who opened my eyes.
LD01189
stand up against injustice.
LD01190
LD01191
words brought something to mind.
LD01192
but can one truly be alive with a hollow
heart?
LD01193
that the path ahead of us will become clear.
LD01194
LD01195
pretty recently.
LD01196
all I do is hurt those around me. I... even
ended up throwing away my pride.
LD01197
but meeting Wonder and the others made me
realize something.
LD01198
even if they affect others.
LD01199
standing tall against injustice.
LD01200
or reason for living taken from them!
LD01202
friends just as I've been.
LD01203
all work out for you!
LD01204
LD01205
I believe we ought to return to our search.
LD01206
haven't even come across Closer yet!
LD01207
for the friend she mentioned before?
LD01208
LD01209
to finding everyone!
LD01220
LD01221
LD01222
Didn't you just learn your lesson!?
LD01223
LD01224
that's a Core
LD01225
LD01226
LD01227
you freaky furball...!
LD01229
LD01230
here!
LD01231
LD01232
I see you haven't changed one bit.
LD01233
LD01234
name at all.
LD01235
before.
LD01236
meet ya!
LD01237
Soy. Good to meet you
LD01238
LD01239
this? Hmm...
LD01240
LD01241
LD01242
way
summons enemies.
LD01243
it. Man
do...
LD01244
do
LD01246
we wouldn't have trouble with those enemies.
LD01247
just take them all out!
LD01248
this
LD01249
around all day thinking of what to do!
LD01250
groups: one to fight off the enemies
other to secure the core?
LD01251
to do with that fraud of a feline.
LD01252
Fraud this
whether you like it or not!
LD01253
LD01254
LD01255
LD01256
LD01257
one time!
LD01258
me a hooded goblin! Wait
LD01259
LD01261
the same side
LD01262
LD01263
rock or paper.
LD01264
LD01265
LD01266
the same team as that wretched cat.
LD01267
LD01268
searching for the Core with me.
LD01269
LD01270
If that's your decision
LD01271
sensor
LD01272
LD01290
LD01291
LD01292
that ramen!
LD01320
all ours!
LD01321
certificate with a star on it.
LD01322
Taking it makes this place collapse
LD01323
gonna come down on us.
LD01325
book it right away.
LD01326
here. Perhaps that is the reason.
LD01327
of more than one.
LD01328
place to collapse?
LD01329
Core.
LD01330
hold!
LD01331
LD01332
LD01333
thanks for saving Wonder.
LD01334
scratch!?
LD01335
No ramen
LD01336
LD01337
serving!
LD01338
LD01339
too!
LD01340
even throw in some gyoza too.
LD01341
LD01342
another Core to find
LD01343
of our friends
LD01344
or Closer...
LD01345
used to the Metaverse yet.
LD01346
just lay the beatdown on any baddies.
LD01347
we should get goin'
LD01348
outside!
LD01349
that direction.
LD01350
a pretty good duo
LD01351
LD01370
it looks just like the other Core.
LD01371
LD01372
familiar to me...
LD01373
seems we may have been lured to another
forgery.
LD01374
in a similar way by this Madarame fellow in
his Palace?
LD01375
Thieves deceived into stealing a fake twice?
LD01376
be a little different from ours...
LD01378
one. We just have to take both.
LD01379
LD01380
like brute-force solutions...
LD01381
LD01382
work of this guy!
LD01400
LD01401
LD01402
heart!
LD01383
at all!
LD01384
while its mouth is closed.
What should we do...
LD01385
it'll have to open its mouth to breathe!
LD01386
mouth... Yes
LD01387
that!?
LD01388
attack... Keep your guard up!
LD01389
before it's able to attack?
LD01390
idea. Let's aim for the eyes!
LD01391
LD01392
I predicted!
LD01393
I must commend your strategy
LD01394
LD01395
stronger after we took down the eye?
LD01396
won't be sufficient.
LD01397
now
LD01398
situation
decisive strike!
LD01399
But we'll just have to take him down!
LD01403
themselves too!
LD01404
as if you already knew.
LD01405
before...
LD01406
think that might've been helpful?
LD01407
LD01408
enemy! If it gets back up
again!
LD01409
LD01410
defeated parts to revive. If that's the
case...
LD01411
before they can come back. Alright
finish 'em off all at once!
LD01420
on a real Core!
LD01421
Madarame but different. What was it?
LD01422
the last guy defending a Core like Kamoshida?
LD01423
LD01424
of change near the entrance.
LD01426
Joker and the others are!
LD01440
LD01441
up ahead.
LD01442
around here...
LD01443
LD01444
LD01445
LD01446
LD01447
The one we were just infiltrating!
LD01448
LD01449
LD01450
a moment ago
LD01451
that we can find our friends there
LD01452
LD01453
here. Turns out they were in an entirely
different Palace.
LD01454
LD01455
point. Wonder
LD01457
LD01480
LD01481
parts. Doesn't it feel a little different
though?
LD01482
LD01483
people as mere tools to bring him money.
LD01484
Kaneshiro's Palace. They even have the
walking cash machines...
LD01485
could anyone possibly think of using others
to line their own pockets?
LD01487
moron who put Pops and Masa-san in a
bad spot.
LD01488
takin' this personally.
LD01489
I bet you'd feel empty obsessing over it.
LD01490
desire.
LD01491
scumbag goes around tricking others to
get it.
LD01492
underhanded scheme.
LD01493
It's 'cause of assholes like him that
innocent people like Pops end up suffering.
LD01494
puts his money where his mouth is!
LD01495
the entrance.
LD01496
LD01497
we found that Core thingy!
LD01498
dangerous for us to go in alone?
LD01499
Let's take a moment to analyze the situation
rather than running in blindly.
LD01500
around here really gonna get us anywhere?
LD01501
would be more efficient...
LD01503
Phew
LD01504
before...
LD01505
I'm Fox
LD01506
LD01510
Phew
LD01511
doing well!
LD01512
worried since you're new to using Personas.
LD01515
LD01516
How'd you figure that out?
LD01518
Queen was convinced I was a bad guy when
we first bumped into each other.
LD01521
LD01524
myself in a similar predicament if it wasn't
for Panther.
LD01525
LD01526
to lose their memories of all that occurred.
LD01527
from under me!
LD01528
move
LD01529
wanted. We'll probably forget this too...
LD01533
LD01535
LD01536
do know that finding the Core will send
us back!
LD01539
getting grilled for answers!?
LD01540
LD01542
LD01544
remarkable.
LD01545
you to joining our Phantom Thieves?
LD01546
LD01548
someone right in front of her friends.
LD01549
LD01551
be more than happy to welcome you.
LD01552
LD01553
He doesn't know when to shut his beak
sometimes.
LD01554
LD01555
need to find Joker.
LD01556
around here.
LD01580
Kaneshiro's Palace.
LD01582
LD01583
LD01584
Persona and was suddenly on a motorcycle.
LD01585
LD01586
money!" and blew the baddies away!
LD01589
capturing the moment with a painting.
LD01590
more? Right here.
LD01594
enjoying yourself.
LD01595
LD01598
LD01599
across as a strong female leader!
LD01600
they say something stupid.
LD01601
Palace? We're entirely unfamiliar with it.
LD01602
seen much of Kaneshiro's...
LD01603
about it then.
LD01604
Kaneshiro's Treasure is.
LD01605
LD01606
This is Joker we're talking about.
LD01607
worry.
LD01608
LD01609
LD01610
I mean he should be fine on his own.
LD01611
all. I doubt any enemies will find him.
LD01612
incredible.
LD01613
own without having to worry about him.
LD01614
LD01615
the Core our primary objective. Now
is it...
LD01616
smell one this time around too.
LD01617
LD01618
Phantom Thief!
LD01640
how much all of this adds up to.
LD01641
stuff you could buy if it wasn't.
LD01642
LD01643
canvases
knives
LD01644
they pretty expensive?
LD01645
the six-figure range.
LD01646
LD01647
brush
LD01648
seen better days... I'd replace those first.
LD01649
of is brushes? Man
art freak.
LD01650
give it to you as a gift
LD01651
LD01652
from wealth
direct it toward his... other ambitions.
LD01653
what would you spend it on?
LD01654
cooked rare... *shlurp*
LD01655
that kind of sound with their mouth before.
LD01656
me along!
LD01657
food comes up?
LD01659
LD01660
LD01661
until I can really make it happen
LD01662
Hit me up when you open shop and I'll
stop by!
LD01663
LD01664
of course!
LD01665
LD01666
enough to build a ballpark?
LD01667
baseball near my house!
LD01669
LD01671
that. Urgh
LD01672
deserve your rage?
LD01673
all this money.
LD01674
buying fancy stuff in the first place.
LD01675
can stretch a little change.
LD01676
if you had stacks of cash like this.
LD01677
in and buy up all their stock.
LD01678
farewell to bean sprout bowls...
LD01679
plain rice?
LD01680
LD01681
LD01682
with all of this cash?
LD01684
said that the riches can lead one to
distortion.
LD01685
LD01686
LD01687
would say.
LD01688
with it...
LD01689
LD01690
don't just take it. You'd be a plain old
robber
LD01720
LD01721
room
LD01722
LD01723
LD01725
LD01740
many?
LD01741
keep on coming forever at this rate!
LD01742
know how long we can keep this up!
LD01743
LD01744
LD01746
LD01748
through!
LD01749
let him in!
LD01750
LD01752
you can see he's got some serious moves!
LD01753
us out?
LD01755
these guys and track him down!
LD01760
with Joker!
LD01771
location of the Core all by himself?
LD01772
so it doesn't surprise me.
LD01773
LD01790
LD01791
cognition for a man obsessed with money.
LD01793
LD01794
LD01795
me sweat a little.
LD01796
LD01799
LD01800
introduce myself
LD01802
ramen next.
LD01803
ramen at Leblanc
LD01805
LD01806
LD01807
LD01808
surely just beyond this door.
LD01809
guarding it.
LD01810
last time
LD01811
LD01813
LD01814
LD01815
so I might hold everyone back. But still...
LD01816
I'm countin' on you guys!
LD01817
LD01818
brought us all together today.
LD01819
to overcome this challenge.
LD01820
get our hands on that Core!
LD01824
LD01825
LD01827
LD01829
ours!
LD01840
guarding the Core.
LD01841
normal Shadow.
LD01842
LD01860
me...!
LD01861
I see! I despise it all...!
LD01862
I desire!
LD01863
LD01864
LD01865
LD01866
This time
LD01867
LD01868
LD01880
LD01881
LD01882
Hurry
LD01890
LD01910
Great job
LD01911
LD01912
much time to talk
LD01913
in the end.
LD01914
LD01915
might be thanks to the courage you gave me.
LD01916
you to thank
LD01917
you around today
LD01918
All of you
LD01919
done it without all of you.
LD01920
ramen and rice... and three plates of gyoza
when we get back.
LD01921
before. Besides
everything when we leave.
LD01922
connection between us... I'm sure we'll
meet again.
LD01923
eternal.
LD01925
that advisor position
LD01926
not gonna have any recollection of what
happened here once we leave!
LD01927
LD01928
precious ally!
LD01930
Queen.
LD01931
we meet either!
LD01932
a boor. She makes an exceptional ally. I hope
you cherish her.
LD01935
have you to thank for that.
LD01936
LD01950
LD01951
LD01952
I don't want to drag you guys down...
LD01953
sidelines.
LD01954
too seriously! Oh wait...
LD01955
That actually gets me kinda hype!
LD01958
staring into space.
LD01959
LD01960
the day off.
LD01961
LD01980
can have it... No one!
LD01981
serious about protecting that money.
LD01983
could find a way to steal it...
LD01990
LD01991
the guards he summoned.
LD01992
out the guards!
LD01993
LD02000
the money he was talking about?
LD02001
we'll be rich!
LD02002
LD02004
like that!
LD02005
from that imitation money... It might be
advantageous to collect them.
LD02006
LD02015
LD02016
bad for him.
LD02017
deep within the soul! You can feel the pain
so vividly!
LD02025
LD02026
piggy bank. How fascinating...
LD02027
to beat something like this!?
LD02028
We can't lose!
LD02030
main course!
LD02031
of such peril is heartening.
LD02032
Skull!
LD02033
the hell out of this guy!
LD02041
Everyone
LD02055
LD02057
bills only to collect them again.
LD02059
I don't really get this
like a pain.
LD02060
of them will be taken back. In short...
LD02062
our allies to transfer the cash.

speaking in the Metaverse...
LD10030
I don't. What about you?
LD10032
You don't seem dangerous
LD10033
you're also a Persona-user
LD10034
I'm <color=#FF423F>Morgana</color>
LD10035
LD10037
LD10038
out there besides our group.
That's quite the surprise.
LD10039
that odd for there to be more
Persona-users who we don't know.
LD10042
keep the details of our operations
to ourselves.
LD10043
I take it you're in the same line of work?
LD10044
that could blow our covers.
LD10045
to investigate the other's activities.
LD10046
This way we can at least relax
with each other.
LD10047
If you'd like coffee or curry
you can have some here anytime.
LD10049
who's looking after this place
while the manager's out.
LD10050
LD10052
LD10053
the coffee or curry at Leblanc!
LD10054
LD10055
I hope you can meet them sometime.
LD10056
LD10057
LD10101
LD10102
LD10103
staring into space. Are you quite all right?
As I was saying
LD10104
The beans must have been high-quality.
LD10301
LD10302
You can just call me Ryuji
the formalities.
LD10303
but we can hang out! Right
LD10311
meet you. I'm <color=#FF423F>Ann Takamaki</color>.
LD10312
my Japanese is just fine!
We can chat as much as you like!
LD10313
after all!
LD10321
about you
LD10322
Phantom Thieves? I won't ask for details
but I do have one request...
LD10951
LD10952
Want to join me for a cup or two?
LD10953
No
LD10954
LD10955
Do you want to play?
LD10956
LD10957
from upstairs today
LD10958
a painting for school. Apparently
taken by inspiration...
LD10323
Hmph... why the suspicious look?
LD10331
I'm <color=#FF423F>Makoto Niijima</color>
manager of sorts.
LD10332
LD10333
LD10341
Just call me Futaba!
LD10342
I'm not very good at talking...
LD10509
Which coffee would you like this time?
LD10510
Should I brew these ones?
LD10343
I-I'm counting on you!
LD10351
My name is Haru Okumura. Nice to meet you!
LD10352
talk to someone from another group of Phantom
Thieves.
LD10353
but I hope we can have a fun time together.
LD10501
LD10502
Feel free to have a coffee to
try them if you'd like.
LD10503
LD10504
Or put some extra sugar in your coffee?
LD10609
Mewhehe...
LD10610
now
LD10505
if you want. Feel free to take it easy
while you're here.
LD10506
left there? I don't know why
feel a bit bolder after reading it.
LD10507
{NAME2}? I feel like there's
a connection between us Persona-users.
LD10508
neither of us knows will show up here...
Who knows.
LD10601
You came again today!
LD10602
I've got my own reserved seat here
so I get it!
LD10603
he's an extremely gracious gentleman
isn't he?
LD10604
after all!
LD10709
LD10710
collapsed. Make sure you're getting enough
food in you before you end up like him.
LD10605
Ren's coffee
LD10606
a bit for me? This tongue of mine
is pretty sensitive.
LD10607
LD10608
so you should get it while it's
hot and fresh!
LD10701
LD10702
You've gotta join me! C'mon
LD10703
LD10704
something else too... I wonder if
I can ask for an extension...
LD10809
excited there? Hmm...
LD10810
about going shopping sometime. I just can't
wait!
LD10705
ramen shop I REALLY recommend!
LD10706
soaking in that rich broth is
making my stomach growl!
LD10707
curry without ya!
LD10708
today... But you make sure to dig in too!
LD10801
some coffee
LD10802
drink to sip as you chill!
LD10803
LD10804
I brought this up
LD10909
something coming to me but...
LD10910
help me find inspiration.
LD10805
group too
LD10806
Persona-users and high schoolers.
How can we not get along!?
LD10807
right now
LD10808
today's curry! So now it's like what other
choice do I have... None
LD10901
some curry? What a coincidence; so have I.
LD10902
art supplies
last me for that time.
LD10903
the rest
with them.
LD10904
You could witness Ryuji's devastating
study techniques.
LD10959
Phew. Staying in the same position for so long
makes my shoulders go stiff...
LD10960
LD10905
LD10906
It removes fatigue with truly
unnatural efficacy.
LD10907
Don't move... Just look this way
and hold that pose!
LD10908
Please
exact position!
LD12001
LD12002
LD12003
Mweheh
LD12004
to ask me for advice anytime!
LD12005
Mona? Monaaa? Is he not here?
LD12006
even more!
LD12007
one go earlier. He's actually really good at it...
LD12008
If you wanna try
LD12009
one in our group with my kind of Persona
LD12010
But I guess it'd be best not to ask too much...
LD12051
coffee pairs with curry
LD12052
LD12053
Said he ran out of money for art supplies again.
LD12054
I worry about him sometimes...
Should I bring him something
LD12055
LD12056
want." I might have a second helping too.
LD12057
after school... I must admit
LD12058
but I haven't followed up on it...
LD12059
I always lose track of time when I'm here...
LD12060
Do you feel the same way
LD11001
LD11002
LD11004
on hand next time I make you coffee.
LD11005
of the beans alone then? Me too.
LD11006
like coffee
something else.
LD11021
A big kitchen must be nice!
LD11022
Only to make curry
LD11024
Okay
Will you taste-test for me?
LD11041
fridge anyway... We got too much stuff from
that big sale at the supermarket.
LD11042
something besides curry. I'm sure Ryuji
will be happy.
LD11071
LD11072
I'll talk to him...
LD11073
I just got some the other day.
LD11043
I'll save you a plate too. So long as you
don't mind a barebones meal...
LD11061
That wouldn't fit with the
horizonal answer...
LD11062
Free or not
solve these!
LD11063
vertical five-letter word over here...
LD11101
had really high-end sushi?
LD11102
or fatty tuna
or kuruma shrimp
LD11104
students rich these days?
LD11105
Eating high-end sushi should be
reserved for special occasions anyway!
LD11106
Not too shabby!
LD11107
I wonder if Lady Ann would share
some with me? Probably not...
LD11121
Don't tell me you're thinking of
petting me...
LD11122
a few strokes. But! Don't touch my tail!
LD11124
than I expected. It's so nice
doze... off... Mewhehe...
LD11141
Phantom Thief groups out there...
It really is a small world!
LD11142
aside from us Phantom Thieves that
also use Personas?
LD11171
had a crêpe before?
LD11172
sometimes... Do high school boys really like
to eat that stuff?
LD11173
I might not stop you.
LD11143
learn more! At least if they're as
friendly as you.
LD11161
right there a read some time.
LD11162
It's about home vegetable gardens
LD11163
It might come in handy!
LD11201
since becoming a Phantom Thief!
LD11202
You got any special training regime?
LD11204
the right equipment if you want results!
LD11501
LD11502
LD11504
LD11505
LD11506
somewhere you feel you can rest.
LD11521
the combination is odd
I've gotten used to it.
LD11522
LD11271
LD11272
I tried drinking a whole soda in one go earlier...
LD11273
LD11524
LD11541
mock exams... Only I have discovered I made
some careless mistakes. How regrettable.
LD11542
another once over before handing it in...
I'll need to try harder going forward.
LD11543
Would you care to join me
LD11561
once I started drinking it
LD11562
LD11563
LD11205
Actually
an upper body workout!
LD11206
push-ups to my set to keep up with you
LD11221
went to
to tell you that?
LD11222
and we still hafta hide stuff? What a pain...
LD11224
in the Metaverse someday
LD11241
Even Ann said so...
LD11242
I just can't remember crap like
numbers and dates...
LD11371
It almost made me scream...
LD11372
Futaba. If you see her too
LD11373
people you knew? Just one of those days?
LD11243
Like that "PEMDAS" thing or somethin'?
LD11261
his cooking and coffee stuff for you here.
LD11262
makes it feel special or somethin'?
LD11263
We're growing boys
LD11301
they had a new seasonal special!
LD11302
muscles..."
MOV00154
make much sense... but it is persuasive.
MOV00155
building himself into the
muscular arm of the law...
MOV00163
his wife in time
countless lives around the world.
MOV00164
and passion... Marvelous
MOV00165
the scientist's eyes gave
me new <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>...
MOV00173
the pain in their hearts that they could
finally begin to rebuild from the war...
MOV00174
came to the town—to signal the true end
of the war...
MOV00175
the artistry of the movie
and the man's <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
MOV00183
disinfectant to save the father who
disapproved of their marriage...
MOV00184
for the sake of love... What a bold decision
they made.
MOV00185
for love in times of turmoil
pulled at my heartstrings.
MOV00193
the alien invasion. Impressive
MOV00194
its moon...?
MOV00195
sparked my imagination...
MOV00203
back-and-forth is improv...
MOV00204
fascinating. I can see why people are
saying the film is interesting.
MOV00205
comedians' witty adlibs...
MOV00213
almost everyone that crossed his path
all to reclaim his master's gold...
MOV00214
to be feared.
MOV00215
samurai's bravery amidst the
tense psychological warfare...
MOV00223
hip pain would be cured by belly dancing?
MOV00224
MOV00225
by the depth of the
caregiver's compassion...
MOV00233
you can't help but sympathize with
the poor idol.
MOV00234
MOV00235
deadly <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color> of
the AI pop idol...
MOV00243
their scales and learned to love one another.
How heartwarming.
MOV00244
MOV00245
that bloomed between
Tita and Nick...
MOV00253
is simply stupendous!
MOV00254
like in the first place?
MOV00255
agent's sharpened senses...
MOV00263
man-made planet to pull off such an
audacious trick shot!
MOV00264
indeed...
MOV00265
skill to master billiards
on a galactic scale.
MOV00273
mutant pigs... Frankenswine's monsters
if you will!
MOV00274
child evolved by eating genetically enhanced
bacon to be a little far-fetched...
MOV00275
of those clever little pigs...
MOV00283
became the pharaoh of legend...
MOV00284
man and the bird feels curiously familiar...
MOV00285
to ride into the danger zone
like that...
MOV00293
the arson plot that threatened to divide
Plantopia.
MOV00294
and veggies alike was stronger than
the hottest flames.
MOV00295
about fruits
and even firefighting...
MOV00303
would say that as she gunned down the mafia?
MOV00304
mafia boss
MOV00305
comes in many forms...
both graceful and deadly!
MOV00010
You've gotta be kiddin'! They'll never listen to ya!
MOV00011
the greatest pirate to ever sail the seven seas!
MOV00012
When I make a decision
MOV00020
government with it! But don't you worry—I'll have this city functioning again!
MOV00021
MOV00022
MOV00030
MOV00031
MOV00032
in the forest together... It's all flooding back to me!
MOV00040
MOV00041
And now I've finally realized what it is that I want...
MOV00042
MOV00050
There's no way I can slurp down those fiery noodles now!
MOV00051
then you don't deserve to call yourself a hero!
MOV00052
we're all counting on
MOV00060
MOV00061
policies that treat people like machines.
MOV00062
reasonable managers who put the wellbeing of employees first!
MOV00070
Now to find the answers to the test...
MOV00071
MOV00072
so please just let me out of here!
MOV00080
One that's even bigger than a watermelon!
MOV00081
MOV00082
and gadgets and cool cars you like!
MOV00090
MOV00091
We're gonna hit that armored truck and rob 'em blind!
MOV00092
and I'm here to arrest you for that hijacking incident!
MOV00100
Now enough of this nonsense! Let's settle this in battle!
MOV00101
MOV00102
marked the final stage of my training! Hiii-yaaah!
MOV00110
take down that damn company and make money lying down.
MOV00111
MOV00112
that company and bleed them dry.
MOV00120
devote myself to savory tofu pudding.
MOV00121
Your love of savory tofu pudding is a total lie!
MOV00122
MOV00130
all you need is knowledge of the game!
MOV00131
the name of the game creator's dog!
MOV00132
MOV00140
MOV00141
but don't misunderstand; I'm doing it out of sympathy
MOV00142
MOV00150
MOV00151
your tail and they're out to arrest you
MOV00152
and make sure that justice is served!
MOV00160
the difference between what's real and what's in your mind...
MOV00161
MOV00162
using the mysterious formulas of love!
MOV00170
MOV00171
gives us the strength to persevere through the war.
MOV00172
MOV00180
You desire wine
MOV00181
then I'm afraid you're sorely mistaken...
MOV00182
MOV00190
MOV00191
We'll use them to propel the Moon back to our home!
MOV00192
but our courage and perseverance will shine as bright as the stars.
MOV00200
on is lucky. But it seems our vic has left with everything but his hat...
MOV00201
just maybe—the victim misplaced it...?
MOV00202
Or doncha have the guts to admit to your mistakes!?
MOV00210
MOV00211
MOV00212
the more you risk to lose...
MOV00220
MOV00221
MOV00222
Thank you for bringing dance into this home! Please
MOV00230
that's been abandoned by the internet and treated like malware?
MOV00231
MOV00232
MOV00240
MOV00241
MOV00242
Don't tell me... you're a mermaid
MOV00250
She was the one who threatened to have me expelled!
MOV00251
you can detect a person's true nature from their scent alone...
MOV00252
faceless
MOV00260
through fear of the Star Killer!
MOV00261
Can an amateur like me really wield it...?
MOV00262
and let your inner pool shark guide you...
MOV00270
MOV00271
MOV00272
so this should be a piece of cake!
MOV00280
MOV00281
MOV00282
How can you control the ultimate Mecha Beast!?
MOV00290
I'm gonna be a great firefighter someday
MOV00291
Just give up on those foolish dreams already
MOV00292
I'll make this city a safer place!
MOV00300
You'll have to practice all night
MOV00301
-But that's impossible! Nobody's perfect...!
MOV00302
MP10001
MP10002
MP10101
MP10102
to ask!
MP10201
wonderful...
MP10202
Palaces you've been to—it's got that
same energy.
MP10203
Palace! How 'bout namin' it "Thieves' Den?"
Sounds fittin' for you and your friends!
MP10301
you'll be able to do even more here...
MP10302
even get the chance to meet some
interesting folks.
MP10303
and this place will start to feel quite
luxurious...
MP10401
Why not head near the entrance
MP10402
and something wonderful will come out!
MP10403
wherever you'd like.
MP10404
thing will surely result in something good
MP10501
all sorts of songs.
MP10502
and your favorite music will start playing.
MP10601
picture frames.
MP10602
paintings lined up here. I'd love to see it.
MP10603
your friends
somethin' to display here!
MP10701
on the second floor...
MP10702
appearance has changed... What a mysterious
thing this is
MP10703
will grow and change.
MP10801
MP10802
happier than a lily in a rainstorm!
MP10803
You'll be rewarded for your efforts!
MP99000
modest expectations.
MP99001
surely be taking a toll on you.
MP99002
forget your troubles.
MP99020
MP99021
words so indiscriminately?
MP99022
MP99023
only obfuscates the meaning!
MP99024
MP99040
decide on our Phantom Thief names.
MP99041
gallant and robust nature?
MP99042
however.
MP99043
MP100001
and comfy!
MP100002
batting cage or two in here
MP100003
Nah
MP100011
movies and stuff
MP100012
that too?
MP100013
MP100014
MP100021
MP100022
Palace blows me away.
MP100023
our break-in tools!
MP100024
Guess you could say I'm kinda jealous!
MP100101
MP100102
MP100103
indoor pool. Ooh! How about we make one now!?
MP100111
get some for myself later!" Y'know?
MP100510
baby's gonna look in a swimsuit...
MP100511
beach house delicacies too
MP100512
anything from the beach hut you really
like to eat?
MP100514
me want to try all the flavors!
MP100515
much fun! My favorite was... Agh
can't choose!
MP100516
trip like that next year
MP100800
MP100804
It's freaking me out!
MP100812
I love Shichi-kun!
MP100815
be a good person!
MP100816
a good person... right?
MP100818
Shichi-kun together! It'll be great!
MP100900
MP100901
my heart out...
MP100902
MP100920
MP100921
MP100922
me instead. I'm glad.
MP100923
sometime though.
MP100940
to stay forever.
MP100941
feelings without putting up a front.
MP100942
when I'm here...
MP100960
The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick...
MP100962
up my enunciation while singing.
MP100963
sick sheik's sick's sheep's sixth...
MP100964
MP100980
my usual guitar.
MP100981
to try it out.
MP100982
it took forever just to remember them!
MP100983
Or are there any you'd like to try?
MP100985
MP101000
traveled abroad before?
MP101002
MP101003
languages. The proof is in my college
grades
MP101004
too nervous to talk to anyone.
MP101005
traveling with me.
MP101006
you should take me with you.
MP101020
Hmhm-hmmm<sprite=1 tint=1>
MP101022
MP101023
so I started humming it out.
MP101024
God
MP101026
MP101027
song then.
MP101028
I'll have to figure out the rest.
MP101029
if I followed that part like this?
MP101050
MP101051

friendship to remain solid.
MP101300
MP101301

MP101405
It's what Shichi-kun said yesterday!
MP101420

MP101422
MP101423
love it to death!
MP101424
want to hear all the details on that one!
MP101425

MP101604

Right?

we were running for an hour straight!
MP101763

MP101800

whole thing.
MP101801
so heavy it was hard to watch...
MP101802
it actually left a bad taste in my mouth.
MP101803
MP101805
I'd say I prefer bright and uplifting stories.
MP101806
something heartwarming at the end.
MP101807
like that?
MP101820
at my place this weekend.
MP101821

MP101963
books must embody our species' sapience!
MP101980
light novels at all?
MP101982
Libraries stock them these days.
MP101983
against light novels based on their genre
and cover art.
MP101984
let go of your preconceptions and try one!
MP102000
do you prefer physical or digital?
MP102002
paperbacks myself...
MP102003
parents want me to get rid of them.
MP102004
app makes it way more convenient. I can
read anywhere!
MP102005
hand! And the smell of old books
is wonderful!
MP102006
the minute they come out!
MP102007
MP102020
parallel world novels?
MP102022
have to worry about running out of them
either. The genre is seemingly endless.
MP102023
you know what you're getting.
MP102024
another world and becomes OP.
MP102025
you know nothing about
MP102026
there's a sudden tragic ending.

for that kind of story!
MP102028
time
MP102029
Well
MP102031

simple yet profound.
MP102160
to amaze me.
MP102161
pronounced as both "o" and "go
MP102201

MP102203
what's a main dish and what's a side?
MP102204
culinary experience here.
MP102205
history is also great...
MP102206

you're young.
MP102253

MP102259
me up.
MP102260
you should throw a few her way?
MP102261
MP102263
fussing over me all of a sudden.
MP102264
makes me feel a whole lot better.
MP102265
in Japan...
MP102266
all that clearly.
MP102267
what's on my mind.
MP102268
great opportunity to learn. Please
me more!
MP102275
{NAME2}-kun and Yaoling.
MP102276
cocktails popular with the kids in China?
MP102277
that uses Chinese wines such as Shaoxing...
MP102279
right after graduating from high school.
MP102280
making a strong alcoholic drink called
baijiu.
MP102281
to drink.
MP102282
MP102283
{NAME2}-kun mentioned that before.
MP102284
many things
stuff they sell here.
MP102285
made with Jasmine leaves...
MP102286
a non-alcoholic cocktail
in other words.
MP102287
as a base with added fruit or mint.
MP102288
to enjoy this one
MP102290
alcohol
MP102291
the true essence of the tea's flavor!
MP102292
stock so I can make it whenever.
MP102293
my horizons more than ever before!
MP102300
MP102301
MP102302
you're done here?
MP102320
MP102321
It really feels very "you" in here.
MP102322
MP102340
so I thought about talking to them
MP102341
MP102342
and make them think I'm an antisocial weirdo.
MP102360
positive and negative meanings?
MP102361
blanca lilies represent?
MP102363
MP102364
both joy and betrayal.
MP102365
so it's said they don't make for good
gifts
MP102366
their positive meaning.
MP102380
MP102381
of flowers
and heavy"?
MP102382
than its flower.
MP102383
little things.
MP102385
MP102386
maybe you are right!
MP102400
meaning perfectly goes
coffee means?
MP102401
MP102402
to relax for a moment
MP102403
shop the other day.
MP102404
MP102406
MP102407
I'll take care of the bill.
MP102420
the language of flowers if you want.
MP102421
time when you work at a florist.
MP102422
and learned some of them.
MP102424
there's downtime at work.
MP102425
MP102426
my studies myself.
MP102427
after all.
MP102440
no way of turning the tables!
MP102441
MP102442
MP102443
MP102444
MP102446
Ashiya-san about some of my old battles.
MP102447
MP102448
so much that she even grants him the power
of destiny.
MP102449
destiny draw.
MP102450
a lot of card games myself.
MP102451
would you be free?
MP102452
MP102453
MP102454
first-year student like me to challenge
a third-year.
MP102455
MP102456
not sure my destiny powers will really
activate...
MP102457
start feeling nervous!
MP102458
We can find a time that works
MP102459
not that destiny requires preparation!
MP102460
all three of us played together!
MP102500
yet surprisingly cozy and welcoming?
MP102501
I start to picture it as a nice little
reading nook...
MP102502
MP102520
MP102521
about something.
MP102522
thoughts just bubble right up
MP102540
approach me looking to start a
conversation...
MP102541
more comfortable.
MP102542
them sometime?
MP102560
MP102562
from some relatives recently.
MP102563
restrictions
MP102564
action is.
MP102580
autographs lately.
MP102582
MP102583
distinctive autograph.
MP102584
as best I could...
MP102585
something so plain-looking.
MP102586
be good for an autograph?
MP102600
with people here...
MP102601
knowledge aren't actually very widely known.
MP102603
MP102604
the part that touches the ice?
MP102605
a regular blade either.
MP102606
You'll see if you look at one yourself.
MP102607
to turn when you skate into a curve.
MP102608
MP102620
MP102622
nothing like that.
MP102623
discussing their favorite cafés.
MP102624
go best with coffee.
MP102625
MP102626
my coach gives me as a reward from time
to time.
MP102627
to be a figure skater.
MP102628
different cakes
MP102630
when we get the chance!
MP102700
because a competition is coming up.
MP102701
I want while I'm performing...
MP102702
MP102720
tests and practice skating at the same time.
MP102721
competition schedule
MP102722
MP102740
movie theater in Yongen-Jaya the
other day.
MP102741
MP102742
I couldn't believe it when I found them.
MP102743
MP102760
playing in a video on my feed.
MP102761
the tip of my tongue...
MP102763
for it like that!
MP102764
knew that was possible!
MP102780
MP102781
MP102783
so I got it renewed the other day.
MP102784
MP102785
person I'm looking at.
MP102786
MP102800
after practice lately.
MP102801
other flavors they make online.
MP102802
They all sound delicious.
MP102804
like to sample lots of different flavors.
MP102805
carbonated water was bad for you...
MP102806
when and how much you drink.
MP102807
you
negatively impact your health.
MP102808
it's important to be aware of what you're
really putting into your body.
MP102820
at the end of a competition.
MP102821
don't you think?
MP102823
what to do with all the flowers I've been
getting.
MP102824
by the entrance to the skating rink...
MP102825
places to display them.
MP102826
before they start to wilt
MP102827
with them?
MP102829
yourself overwhelmed with flowers.
MP102830
waste them is a good idea.
MP102860
had your fashion sense!
MP102861
MP102862
MP102863
Kotone-chan's sense of style!
MP102864
on her phone too...
MP102865
She's like fashion incarnate!
MP102867
I see them.
MP102868
considering your level
MP102869
Kichijoji that I've always used.
MP102870
that's near the jazz bar?
MP102871
MP102873
in the know has heard of them.
MP102874
so amazing!
MP102875
MP102876
to be only in their thirties at most...
MP102900
superheroes. Not bad.
MP102901
everyone's personalized mech.
MP102902
I want to be blue or black then!
MP102920
actually.
MP102921
I think support roles like Blue are
really cool.
MP102922
rad too!
MP102940
I want to build up my stamina.
MP102941
weightlifting? You wouldn't get mad
would you?
MP102942
moves instead. How's Justice Blast sound?
MP102960
hero
MP102961
rangers
MP102963
the other
MP102964
comrades gets me real excited.
MP102965
hero who battles on alone with no one to
cheer them on!
MP102966
anything else.
MP102967
your friends in battle
MP102980
can be so tight
bodies can be seen.
MP102981
skinny
MP102982
more diverse actors of different builds
or height.
MP102983
one
MP102984
female live-action rangers
MP102985
were just played by short men!
MP102987
you
behind the mask!
MP102988
so I don't really stand out there...
MP102989
I could fit a lot of different roles.
MP103010
Shichi-kun in Shibuya?
MP103012
Definitely caught me off guard the first
time I saw it.
MP103013
person inside that suit.
MP103014
that in that kind of outfit!
MP103015
I'd love to talk to them sometime.
MP103016
I can't just talk to them if they're on
the job.
MP103017
Shichi-kun's actor
MP103030
MP103032
in a bad way though.
MP103033
person I look like... in a bad way
MP103034
the same reaction from everyone.
MP103035
in that way.
MP103036
put yourself down to praise others.
MP103037
jealous
MP103039
Ugh
MP103040
I'm glad we're friends.
MP103041
our future ventures take us
MP103060
similar to that of a chosen one.
MP103061
like that once.
MP103062
so... I guess I wasn't special.
MP103063
from you even in this state.
MP103065
the tone of the conversation!
MP103066
keeps good company
MP103067
you be... another kindred spirit?
MP103068
join your group!
MP103069
we can still face our battles together.
MP103070
{NAME1}-kun earlier.
MP103071
side
MP103073
to be our intermediary! Your job is to
introduce us to each other!
MP103074
but we still don't know each other's names!
MP103075
MP103076
become a costumed stuntman! Nice to
meet you.
MP103077
chosen one.
MP103100
MP103101
people here. Do you know them all?
MP103102
I'll need to apply myself to be more
sociable.
MP103120
MP103121
but I'm making do with some ginger and honey.
MP103122
on toast. I'm sure you'll find it to satisfy
your cravings in many delightful ways!
MP103123
I just wanted to say
honey.
MP103140
busy
stress.
MP103141
and stress is an eternal one.
MP103142
tired is quite something. It's a battle
I fight daily.
MP103160
with you.
MP103161
umbrella during a sudden shower.
MP103162
committing theft
MP103163
MP103165
about being correct.
MP103166
in my thinking and careful with my words.
MP103180
trademark behavior of a criminal that can
be used to link them to multiple crimes.
MP103181
use "MO" casually to refer to their habits
and guilty pleasures.
MP103182
but feel taken aback when people use it
like that.
MP103183
you feel that way?
MP103185
mistakenly used in that way as well.
MP103186
about them
on it.
MP103200
in something that may not be based on proof.
MP103201
to uphold a standard of honesty and integrity
when dealing with others.
MP103202
third parties too.
MP103204
need to work matters out between people.
MP103205
but its definition varies greatly from person
to person.
MP103206
in reality
MP103220
to those of others.
MP103221
by insisting on formal correctness.
MP103222
come to different conclusions?
MP103223
while others value the means as well.
MP103224
important in and of itself.
MP103226
MP103227
depths that I cannot...
MP103228
conclusion I couldn't have reached alone.
MP103229
you for that to happen.
MP103250
you know
MP103251
middle school. She even gets me nervous.
MP103252
MP103253
truly important if you're too by the book.
MP103254
when you're around me?
MP103255
be correct.
MP103256
strive to keep it in mind going forward.
MP103258
refreshing lesson to receive...
MP103259
thought it'd be amusing. My apologies.
MP103260
MP103261
MP103262
like you're putting on a fake mask.
MP103263
to act like some authority
MP103264
putting up quite a front...
MP103265
to an old lady like me.
MP103266
the start here.
MP103267
I'd expect {NAME1}-kun to know.
MP103269
feel as if you've given me some form
of approval.
MP103270
words however you like.
MP103300
we are
MP103301
MP103302

school together...
MP103416

MP103424
MP103425
MP103426
MP103427
MP103428

MP103429
MP103430
MP103431
Haruna Nishimori.
MP103432
Doctors are way cooler!
MP103433
a friend like that.
MP103434
You're friends with a doctor!
MP103500
MP103501
MP103502

MP103521
MP103522

MP103540
MP103541
the same time...
MP103542
MP103560
favorite kind of crêpe?
MP103561
right now? Just curious about your tastes!
MP103563
those
MP103564
I'll practice those
MP103580
people at work about sports.
MP103581
favorite teams are rivals or something...
MP103582
they always ask what pro team I like!
MP103583
that happens...
MP103585
teams just to get into fights over them.
MP103586
I'll try doing that from now on.
MP103600
what I need?
MP103601
a question...
MP103602
in a vending machine
MP103604
safe option instead.
MP103605
a weird one
MP103606
that oyster sauce cider!
MP103620
got a question...
MP103621
or contacts?
MP103622
feel kinda weird going out without them.
MP103623
second opinion
MP103625
I'll go with that...
MP103626
not just the glasses
and clothes...
MP103627
known you for a while. Thoughts?
MP103629
MP103630
MP103650
MP103651
MP103653
MP103654
MP103656
was feeling down...
MP103657
was wrong!
MP103658
a lot
MP103659
stuff we've both been through
MP103660
I don't have time to spend feeling down!
MP103661
good dose of hype!
MP103662
motivate myself
breath
MP103663
MP103664
MP103665
join us?
MP103666
all together!
MP103667
MP103700
MP103701
like this?
MP103702
It kind of reminds me of a jazz bar.
MP103720
any wacky drunks around...
MP103721
a relief.
MP103722
need to be careful about where you do it.
MP103723
you're drinking to forget.
MP103740
like something you'd expect from someone
my age.
MP103741
today was at its height even when I was
a kid.
MP103742
been about what's in fashion.
MP103760
around your age...
MP103761
become a lot freer
share of troubles too.
MP103762
I turned out like this because of when I
was born.
MP103763
youths act the same
a very strong image associated with it.
MP103982
outfit come to mind?
MP103984
for maids
MP103985
Maybe a full-on maid bar could work...
MP103986
out of the gutter!
MP104000
performance on the street in Shinjuku.
MP104001
age
her years!
MP104002
performance
MP104004
we do is very different.
MP104005
reminds me that I have to work hard too!
MP104006
any change on me.
MP104007
MP104008
this month's looking a little tough...
MP104020
{NAME2}-kun? Or are they lightweights?
MP104022
even with parents who drink a lot.
MP104023
will tell how you'll turn out.
MP104024
drinking type...
MP104025
me when you're of age
MP104027
ever show you my cool side.
MP104028
I think? Maybe?
MP104029
you how to take care of me
MP104100
MP104101
I try to cut costs
MP104102
MP104120
MP104121
MP104122
MP104140
with my marionettes!
MP104141
set up all my stuff here
MP104142
'Kay
MP104160
I should try that...
MP104162
up so much stuff that it's getting pretty cramped.
MP104163
to organize it all.
MP104164
after work tomorrow!
MP104180
MP104181
sooo exhausting lately.
MP104182
myself unwind
just melted awaaay.
MP104184
MP104185
me hungry.
MP104200
MP104201
forever since I've had space like this!
MP104202
MP104204
have some! You'd sleep so well here!
MP104205
maybe a manga-reading corner...
MP104220
here
MP104221
performance from time to time?
MP104222
MP104224
That's a great idea!
MP104225
it'd be a huge hit!
MP104226
plan it out right away!
MP104227
when I'm with you!
MP104229
to all my shows!
MP104300
MP104301
we just met the other day.
MP104302
MP104320
whenever we cross paths. You really are a
polite one.
MP104321
is what draws so many people to you?
MP104322
MP104340
MP104341
to me. I didn't mean it like that.
MP104342
conversations with others
were going to break some news to me.
MP104343
MP104360
MP104362
MP104363
read next...
MP104364
a good chunk of a longer novel?
MP104380
I'm too serious.
MP104381
when others aren't serious?
MP104383
but I wouldn't even know where to even start.
MP104384
of trying to please people and regretting it.
MP104385
MP104400
MP104401
novel of Toshia Soomy!
MP104402
edition came out
MP104404
exactly the same.
MP104405
falling apart.
MP104406
and then the new edition came out.
MP104407
five copies.
MP104408
the wear and tear!
MP104420
Toshia Soomy's books?
MP104421
their books with new cover designs.
MP104422
out of money.
MP104424
for my wallet
for now.
MP104425
MP104426
after buying five
MP104427
two left...
MP104428
MP104429
into forbidden territory.
MP104430
MP104450
MP104452
at school...
MP104453
deal
MP104454
feeling depressed?
MP104455
when I do...
MP104456
MP104457
MP104458
forgotten whatever was bothering me.
MP104460
your memory of just about anything.
MP104461
there's a lesson to learn in there somewhere?
MP104462
in worrying.
MP104463
but I can see that my situation isn't so bad.
MP104464
of help
MP104465
I'm definitely not following your example!
MP104500
MP104501
MP104502
Who knows? Hehe.
MP104520
MP104521
MP104522
MP104540
You doing all right?
MP104541
MP104542
MP104560
means no problems or issues.
MP104561
something's missing.
MP104563
MP104564
is my favorite thing in the world.
MP104580
MP104582
like that.
MP104583
people who do good deeds for me.
MP104584
snack a minute ago.
MP104585
accepted it.
MP104586
MP104600
always
MP104601
burst into tears.
MP104602
MP104604
He thanked me so much I felt bad.
MP104605
MP104606
at his company!
MP104607
MP104609
{NAME2}?
MP104611
the author.
MP104612
book is about.
MP104613
but that doesn't mean I like all their books.
MP104614
authors
MP104615
like gambling.
MP104616
what it's about.
MP104618
a fan.
MP104619
MP104620
MP104621
me thinking
MP104623
see
with others.
MP104624
to meals even when they're my senior.
MP104625
like that.
MP104626
for me...
MP104627
MP104628
MP104630
MP104631
go away...
MP104632
find people like him easily.
MP104633
praise. I'm nobody special.
MP104634
thoughtful present from you
MP104635
MP104636
MP104638
MP104639
high schoolers... I guess?
MP104700
MP104701
MP104702
is recruiting?
MP104720
MP104721
moment and soak in the summer air...
MP104722
MP104740
unusual to work...
MP104741
I could get used to it...
MP104742
or anything!
MP104743
MP104760
MP104762
MP104763
the staff meals at the beach house...
MP104764
lose that weight again... Ahaha...
MP104780
do you like on your shaved ice?
MP104782
MP104783
when you're done
MP104784
MP104785
all the same flavor
MP104786
taste different!
MP104800
you'd only get to do at the right place
and time.
MP104801
for one season and then disappear again.
MP104802
again
MP104803
a Shinto shrine or a traditional inn?
MP104805
MP104806
MP104820
forget sunscreen.
MP104822
MP104823
the other day...
MP104824
boiled lobster!
MP104825
by my hat and uniform...
MP104826
seen like this...
MP104828
MP104829
MP104830
MP104900
Good job out there.
MP104901
time
MP104902
forget it.
MP104920
MP104921
in thought.
MP104922
The blend
I would pair it with...
MP104923
How about we go grab one later?
MP104940
MP104941
MP104942
like the perfect spot for a Phantom Thief
to hide.
MP105000
MP105001
you in this form feels like a bit of a bonus!
MP105002
MP105020
Mementos or any Palace. Kinda mysterious
you know?
MP105021
to do with it? Hmm...
MP105022
guess we'll be fine.
MP105023
Fill me in if you know.
MP105040
how about I teach you how to be a real
phantom thief?
MP105041
gentleman of class—elegant
MP105042
...What's with that skeptical look of yours?
MP105100
MP105101
MP105102
go with shoyu or miso?
MP105120
MP105121
MP105122
fresh" all jumbled together.
MP105123
MP105140
big
MP105141
from wall to wall...
MP105142
get in trouble for running indoors?
MP105200
MP105201
good afternoon?
MP105202
hello
MP105220
MP105221
actually kinda cozy here.
MP105222
aren't any Shadows. It almost feels like
déjà vu.
MP105223
MP105240
MP105241
serious problem or anything.
MP105242
try next... Wait
MP105300
MP105301
faces—ample material for observation.
MP105302
sense of relief. By the way... may I sketch
you?
MP105320
MP105321
a faint light
MP105322
MP105323
my brush! Wait
it's missing!
MP105340
time passes
hungry...
MP105341
craving
MP105342
hot pot? And we can finish the soup by
adding rice afterward.
MP105900
MP105901
hang of it.
MP105903
bonito flakes.
MP105904
Soy is an authority on the subject.
MP105905
MP105906
much already.
MP105907
quickly so that I can teach others.
MP105908
we could all practice and teach each other.
MP105909
how to make curry
MP105911
MP105912
so you might have some competition for
the role.
MP105913
loses it when it comes to sweet stuff.
MP105914
myself.
MP105915
I'd love to get Panther to try a bite.
MP105916
MP105918
kitchen
MP105950
MP105951
MP105953
escalate into an undignified debate!
MP105954
correct way of the world.
MP105955
to be
MP105957
Imagine the succulent flavors you are missing!
MP105958
lemur-wannabe even tried sushi?
MP105959
the sumptuous taste of meat on the bone?
MP105960
fill at Noir's house!
MP105961
for sushi coming right up!
MP105962
MP105964
MP105965
carried away.
MP105967
you your temporary ceasefire.
MP105968
wouldn't hurt. That juicy pork... *shlurp*
MP106000
MP106001
Oh
MP106003
in the Metaverse. I mean
MP106004
the conversation kinda blew up.
MP106005
referring to the weight...
MP106006
They'd flatten you in an instant!
MP106007
talking about the gun I use.
MP106008
Metaverse
MP106009
what not? Wind might know more about this.
MP106010
you can easily use somethin' so cool.
MP106011
That's impressive
MP106013
here. Maybe it's best to give it a rest
for now.
MP106014
Metaverse
MP106015
stuff like that sounds unreal!
MP106050
to eat a certain food?
MP106051
something even without watching a food
video or anything!
MP106052
right now.
MP106053
that I want to eat?
MP106054
me a hint at least! Is it sweet?
MP106055
MP106056
banana custard ones!
MP106057
MP106058
obvious ones! Hey
MP106060
wouldn't mind one of those right now...
MP106061
miso-flavored peanuts!
MP106062
irresistible! But... how did you know?
MP106063
Closer
MP106064
anything else now!
MP106065
cause! Ahhh
MP106100
MP106101
MP106102
Isn't a whip kind of difficult to use?
MP106103
MP106104
I just enjoy lashing it about.
MP106105
everyday life
MP106106
swords on a daily basis
MP106108
allows you to pull off moves you can't
usually do.
MP106109
throwing an umbrella before.
MP106110
should feel happy about that or not.
MP106111
might work out in the Metaverse!
MP106112
up on that?
MP106113
Aim
MP106114
MP106150
where I'm not allowed to move?
MP106151
your motion that I want to capture.
MP106152
do is have you mimic the movements.
MP106154
Kinda like air guitar but with a strainer?
MP106155
had tools
do here...
MP106156
MP106157
I'm game as long as I can move.
MP106158
bonito flakes. I can do it in my sleep!
MP106160
working for you
MP106161
Well
MP106162
Ha
MP106163
movements... This is exactly what I wanted.
MP106164
swimmingly at that! Wooo!
MP106200
to write with?
MP106202
anything really...
MP106203
have to memorize it somehow.
MP106205
MP106208
Even I can remember everything...
MP106209
listening just isn't enough!
MP106212
MP106215
MP106302
outrageous appetites...
MP106303
plum dishes.
MP106305
also have a restaurant that specializes in
plum dishes.
MP106306
some stores that specialize in plum wine.
MP106308
it popular with athletes.
MP106313
time. That way
compare them.
MP106314
makes it goes well with fluffy rice. Shall I
ask Soy to make it for us?
MP106400
could learn to manipulate computer systems
like you
MP106401
MP106405
MP106406
This is not something you can pick up
overnight.
MP106407
know about hacking!
MP106415
could support the team like you do
MP106416
my own way the best I can.
MP106500
MP106503
they're really filling!
MP106504
tomatoes
MP106506
tons of tomatoes in it!
MP106508
MP106510
some greens of my own!
MP106512
eat them all here together.
MP106513
patch here?
MP106515
planters
MP106602
me blush...
MP106604
MP106605
anything like this.
MP106606
to change like this
MP106607
MP106612
seriously do it justice?
MP106615
phantom thief costumes someday.
MP106701
saw what she says she saw.
MP106704
two heads.
MP106709
she mentioned it was slender.
MP106712
Care to join
MP106803
your face within the time limit.
MP106807
to try it.
MP106809
I saw one of your lunches...
MP106811
MP106813
MP106901
What of it?
MP106906
appearance bears similarity to an owl.
MP106907
MP106908
I always could!
MP106909
I could fly in the Metaverse as well...
MP106910
high can be quite the challenge.
MP106913
like you
MP106914
So
MP107002
But the first thing that comes to mind
is frankfurters.
MP107003
grilled ones are the best. They're
hooting sublime!
MP107005
only understand by refining your palate.
MP107010
making a strange face.
MP107013
refrain from doing in plain sight.
MP107014
tarnished if word were to spread!
MP107016
MP107101
MP107102
MP107103
MP107104

MP107250
Then I press this button...
And last but not least...
MP107251
nothin' beats a sweet servin' of Marthym's
stellar customer service!
MP107252
with some music.
MP107254
of these

MP107255
then select the name of a song...
MP107256

MP107257
MP107300
such a contraption before.
MP107301
MP107303
machines with big spools of film that go
round and round...
MP107304
the film in.
MP107305
I'll just go ahead and press 'em!
MP107306

everything I know.
NpcDialog_272208
a Menace
people who trouble others.
NpcDialog_272209

forbidden by law...
NpcDialog_272210
NpcDialog_2102011

you get people who are purposefully trying to
get on there.

NpcDialog_272215

Blegh.

don't like them.

NpcDialog_272231
Menaces do anything to stop them
NpcDialog_272232
affects you personally
NpcDialog_272233
just ends up as free publicity
for the Menaces.
NpcDialog_272234
it's never really bad. Especially these days.
NpcDialog_272235
NpcDialog_272236
just ask. I'd be happy to share what I can.
NpcDialog_272300
checking the Divine Judgment story
right now...
NpcDialog_272301
who knows a thing or two about Divine
Judgment.
NpcDialog_272303
through such feigned ignorance.
NpcDialog_272304
makes me the real newspaper club ace!
NpcDialog_272307
Magatsukami's website for reporting Menaces.
NpcDialog_272308
they have about Menaces who are
causing trouble.
NpcDialog_272309
it for yourself.
NpcDialog_272310
NpcDialog_272311
Though
NpcDialog_272312
video posts are just more attention-grabbing.
NpcDialog_272314

NpcDialog_272315
for that much info. It's a low barrier
for entry.
NpcDialog_272316

still rising...

I guess.

NpcDialog_272325
NpcDialog_272326
Magatsukami just picks them arbitrarily.
NpcDialog_272327
downsides to Divine Judgment.
NpcDialog_272328
publicizing information about Menaces...
NpcDialog_272329
to harass or even dox people over
petty grievances.
NpcDialog_272330
are clearly connected to personal
information leaks...
NpcDialog_272331
most posts
get ignored.
NpcDialog_272333
NpcDialog_272334
problems all social media sites have.
NpcDialog_272335
to single out Divine Judgment for that.

Ro10504
mouthwateringly juicy steak...

Ro11107
Ro11111
to me.
Ro11112
just my life...
Ro11201
don't you think?
Ro11202
a profit.
Ro11203
would certainly recommend investing in it.
Ro11204
it's a high-risk
Ro11205
option! It's a guaranteed principal
as profitable as the other one...
Ro11206
Ro11211
is a surefire success. I was thinking the
exact same!
Ro11221
the only way to get ahead! I was thinking
the exact same!
Ro11222

Ro11301
Ro11302
Ro11303

Ro11521

Ro11601
Ro11602
the road's iced over... Whoa
Ro11603
like this!
Ro11604
piping hot
Ro11605
hot coffee would be even worse...
Ro11606
Or do I take my time and accept the
one-star review...
Ro11610
bad luck.

Ro11702

Ro11703
whatever you want to believe.

whole situation at all.
Ro11705

Ro11711
Well then
Ro11721
Farewell.
Ro11731

Ro12002
Ro12003
Ro12004

which machines are easy to win. Heheh.
Ro12005
But if you just keep trying
guaranteed to win.

 to make ramen with a flavor we
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
 and started spouting BS

 so I was aware he was just

Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
 but
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
 crappy bonito flakes.
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000

 to keep me from gettin' into

Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
 and that's why
he confessed.
3895999,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I wish Miyazawa would just admit his
wrongdoing to the world like Kiuchi did...
3896000,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But there's no way everything could work
itself out that easily.
3896001,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sorry, one sec.
3896002,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That asshole! Are you kiddin' me!?
3896003,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I have to go. Something's come up.
3896005,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's nothin'. You should eat your lunch.

just uploaded...
3896031,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Sorry for calling you here so suddenly,
but I think you'd better give it a watch.
3896050,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to
Katana Tongue Live.
3896051,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,Now, sorry to surprise you all during lunch
hour, but I am here to announce the next
Food Fight!
3896052,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,The battle will commence here at Shinjuku's
Victory Kitchen! You might remember it from
my Stupidly Honest Review series on TV.
3896053,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,This shop lost its flavor until I worked
with them to bring it back.
3896055,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,In light of that success, the shop's founder
Yamagoshi-san has turned management rights
over to me.
3896056,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,With this, I intend to bring Victory
Kitchen's popularity to new and greater heights!
3896057,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,But in spite of all this, there is a kid out
there claiming Victory Kitchen's current
taste is not true to the original.
3896058,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,Apparently, he's notorious for bad-mouthing
restaurants all over town.
3896059,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,What's this really about? Engagement
farming? Trying to become a Menace and get his
fifteen minutes of fame?
3896060,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,I think it's only proper to settle things
with a boy like this in front of an audience.
3896061,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,In the next episode of Food Fight, I'll have
him produce this supposed real flavor"

3906657,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Why indeed. Well, my thoughts are...
3906658,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Firstly, I believe the fact that Akashi and
Katayama are connected in the real world is
a large part of it.
3906659,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,So in the Metaverse, that toxic connection
entangled their twisted desires as their
Shadows began clashing.
3906660,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,In short, their negative emotions have
synergized, amplifying one another's
twisted desires.
3906661,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Those melded desires most likely resulted
in a Joint Palace.
3906662,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Ms. Katayama lost control of herself and her
desire because Akashi put her in a corner.
3906663,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,However, that was his intention. His
provocations sent her into a downward spiral.
3906664,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Then the Palace came about. That was likely
part of his scheme as well.
3906666,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I've mentioned before that Akashi was
formerly a business consultant, right?
3906667,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Well, I did some digging into the companies
he worked with.
3906668,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,The company culture improved once that

A<#000000
A<#000000
 it'll feel more natural to start

A<#000000
A<#000000

 and I learned why she
A<#000000
A<#000000
AAAAAA==
 you don't fall out of
A<#000000

 you're practically glowing!

A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
 of course.
A<#000000
 though.
A<#000000
 but it feels like a waste.
A<#000000
 y'know?
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
 I want to watch!
A<#000000
A<#000000
 too.
A<#000000
A<#000000
 like you were looking out
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
 but it's going.
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
 no matter what.
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
 the feelings I want to put into song.
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
 so... um...
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000

 I'd love to hear...
A<#000000
A<#000000
 that's for sure.
A<#000000
A<#000000
 the folks who listened to my first
A<#000000

A<#000000
 it's for you
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000
A<#000000

COOP83255,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I've always been bad with that sort of thing.
I make one fielding error, and I just can't
get back on track.
COOP83256,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Motoha and I were battery mates since
elementary school, and she was always
covering for me.
COOP83257,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I've been doing my best to function on my own
ever since she quit, but...
COOP83258,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Before I know it, I'm right back where I
started.
COOP83260,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Thanks. I'll do my best!

back on the horse in no time.

tape, cooling sprays, the works.
COOP83310,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I used to stop by here all the time after

Yaol<#000000
 right?
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000

Yaol<#000000

Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
 it's pretty quiet here
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
 it's a cool story
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
 you'll come with
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
 creating a... donut
Yaol<#000000
 bring to a simmer
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
Yaol<#000000
 if you ask me.
COOP92085,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Monjayaki kinda captures that side of Japan,
too. Don't you think, Sensei?
COOP92086,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,That was just my impression. Sounds pretty
deep when you think about it, right?
COOP92087,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,What makes a monjayaki gradually changes
over time.
COOP92089,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah! It'll burn if we keep chatting like this,
Sensei. Let's dig in!
COOP92096,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Whoaaa! We're so high up! You can see the
entire skyline of Tokyo from here!
COOP92097,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I know it's a broadcasting tower, but it's
about as tall as the skyscrapers in Shanghai.
COOP92098,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,The area around here's cool, too. They
plopped a modern marvel smack-dab in the
old district.
COOP92099,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,You've got a river, greenery, and a range of
eateries... I could never get sick of
exploring this place.
COOP92100,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Once we're done soaking in the view, where
would you recommend we go next, Sensei?
COOP92102,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ooh, so you mean the rivers around here
aren't just for show?
COOP92103,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Shinjuku and Shibuya are great, don't get me
wrong, but old Tokyo's on the east side.
COOP92104,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Along the riverside too, according to what
I've read. I'm guessing we'll be able to
see it?
COOP92105,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ahh, I've heard of that place. They say you
can see a ton of penguins inside...
COOP92106,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I wonder whether they get on well... How do
penguins even view friendship anyway?
COOP92107,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,We still haven't checked out the shop below
either. Could go look for some souvenirs...
COOP92108,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,There's no way we can see all of this in one
day, that's for sure.
COOP92109,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I think I'll be coming back here again soon.
No, you can count on it!
COOP92110,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's nice how you can see famous spots of
Tokyo you'd usually only see on maps, and
unravel their history.
COOP92117,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's always so nice around here no matter
when you come, huh? It's got such a relaxing
vibe.
COOP92118,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Yeah, I can really get a feel for Sensei's
everyday high school life here!
COOP92119,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's so quiet, and you can feel the natural
energy and stuff... It's, like... majestic,
I guess? Yeah, that's the word!
COOP92120,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's a dish with more of a history than I
realized... You could call it Tokyo's secret
specialty, huh?
COOP92121,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Being up high is super exciting, right? I can
tell you think so too!
COOP98000,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah, Sensei. It's, uh... I know it's sudden,
but...
COOP98001,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Today, I'd really like to see what your place
is like!
COOP98003,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Really? That's okay? Thank you so much! I was
kinda nervous, but I'm glad I asked!
COOP98005,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah, I get it. That's too bad. Maybe some
other time. I'd really like to come over!
COOP98006,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hmm, I see, I see. So this is the kind of
house Sensei lives in.
COOP98007,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Considering you live alone, everything's
super neat and orderly. I'd expect no less
from Sensei, of course!
COOP98008,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah, as for the state of my own room... I am 
not taking any questions at this time,
got it?
COOP98009,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,After all, today we're just checking out
Sensei's room, and...
COOP98010,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Having some tea!
COOP98011,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hehe. This is a super-fancy craft tea I
bought. I hoped we could try it together,
Sensei!
COOP98012,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,...The flowers should be blooming now. Now,
please... partake? Enjoy? What do people
usually say here?
COOP98014,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I know, right? Whoever came up with this
must've been a genius, don't you think?
COOP98015,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,With all of the flowers floating around, you
can really enjoy this tea before you even
take the first sip.
COOP98016,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Totally! I don't know all the details, but...
COOP98017,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It seems they take the tea leaves, wrap them
around the dried flowers, and tie them all by
hand one by one... I think!
COOP98018,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Here you go, Sensei, enjoy it while it's hot!
COOP98019,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,After we finish this one, we can try the
jasmine and peony flowers next. Well, enjoy!
COOP98021,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hehe. I brought something special for you to
try, Sensei.
COOP100000,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,......
COOP100001,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, {NAME2}... Sorry, I was chewin' on
an idea...
COOP100002,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, but since you're here...
COOP100003,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Totally out of the blue, I know, but are you
hungry right now?
COOP100005,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Perfect. There's something I wanna talk to
you about.
COOP100006,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,This isn't the place for it, though. Let's
head on over to Ogikubo.
COOP100007,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Okay, no worries. Sorry to keep you.
COOP100008,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've been wantin' to try this ramen shop for
forever now.
COOP100009,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's your classic Chinese-style ramen.
COOP100010,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I dunno about you, but when I hear
old-fashioned ramen
 you mix the noodles yourself with
Shun K<#000000
 okay?
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
 man!?
Shun K<#000000

Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
 look.
Shun K<#000000
 so it's easier to mix.
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000
Shun K<#000000

Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000

 so I asked him to send me a pic
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000
 then what has my life

 isn't it?
Kayo <#000000

 but I'm always looking at what
Kayo <#000000
 I asked if he was carrying any
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000

 huh?
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000
Kayo <#000000

DS612106,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,You're here again, {NAME1}-kun!
You're pretty dedicated, huh?
DS612107,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Your bass skills are improving
significantly too. Can't let myself
fall behind!
DS612108,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,All right, let's jam!
DS612109,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Great work! We finished everything
I had planned for rehearsal today,
so let's wrap up.
DS612110,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,You're keeping up well, {NAME1}-kun.
I think you have a talent for music.
DS612111,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I'm so glad you joined our club, {NAME1}-kun!
See you next practice.
DS612112,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Are you ready, {NAME2}-kun?
DS612113,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Tsurumi and Taiko are rearing to go!
I am too, of course.
DS612114,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,All right, we're all set. Let's hit it!
DS612115,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Great work. Let's wrap up for today.
That was kind of tiring.
DS612116,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Oh, by the way...
DS612117,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Mr. Higashino said he'd leave out some
snacks for when we want to take a breather.
DS612118,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,All right, let's eat some sweets
and charge up for tomorrow!
DS612119,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Hey, {NAME2}-kun. Thanks for
coming today.
DS612120,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I can't believe we finally get to perform
in a competition.
DS612121,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I hope we place well. On that note, let's
start practice!
DS612122,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Good work, {NAME2}-kun.
How's it going on bass?
DS612123,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,If you have any questions about the sheet
music, feel free to ask me.
DS612124,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Oh, school's almost over. Wanna head to the
station together?
DS612125,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,{NAME2}-kun! Glad you're here!
Think that makes everyone, right?
DS612126,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,The competition is soon, so we're all
pretty fired up!
DS612127,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I'm so excited. I feel like today's gonna be
our best rehearsal yet!
DS612128,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Good job, {NAME2}-kun. That was so fun!
DS612129,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Are you free after this? We were talking
about grabbing dinner before heading home.
DS612130,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Want to come with us, {NAME2}-kun?
Tsurumi says she knows a really good spot!
DS612200,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Hey, {NAME1}-kun! Fancy meetin' you here.
DS612201,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I'm on my way back from a run.
And I didn't get lost this time!
DS612202,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Are you free right now?
Wanna shoot the breeze for a bit?
DS612203,Choices,I'm free.|Not now.
DS612204,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Great! Then let's hang out for a bit.
DS612205,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Oh, that's too bad. Later then!
DS612206,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The park nearby is one of
my favorite places to run.
DS612207,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Doing laps there really lets you
appreciate the changing seasons.
DS612208,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Like, in spring the ground is covered
in cherry blossom petals and gets all
slippery.
DS612209,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,It can be dangerous running on those,
you know! But the added challenge
motivates me.
DS612210,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The temperature changes every day too,
so you have to think about how best
to pace yourself.
DS612211,Choices,What about summer?|What about fall?|What about winter?
DS612212,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Summer's a battle against the heat!
It's really dangerous if you don't hydrate.
DS612213,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I carry a drink, obviously, but it's still
nice to know there are water fountains
nearby just in case.
DS612214,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I'd also recommend a park with lots of trees.
DS612215,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The risk of getting heatstroke is lower
when you've got shade.
DS612216,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The fallen leaves really alter the condition
of the ground. They're fun to step on though.
DS612217,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,But you'd better be careful of parks
with ginkgo trees!
DS612218,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The fallen nuts have a really strong smell.
If you slip and fall on them, it's pretty
bad.
DS612219,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I fell on a bunch once... The smell got
all over me. I couldn't bear taking
the train like that.
DS612220,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Winter's my personal favorite!
The more you run the warmer you feel.
It's pretty nice!
DS612221,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,But the real hard part about winter
is the wind. Cold wind really drains
your energy.
DS612222,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The cold wind and sweating combined
can make your body get dangerously cold.
DS612223,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,So if you go for a run in winter, you'll want
to pick a park with evergreens to block
the wind!
DS612224,Inner Thoughts,Seems like Komatsu likes to
run all year round...
DS612225,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,But sometimes I even get lost in the parks.
DS612226,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I'll be running laps and then next thing
I know I'm not even in the park anymore!
DS612227,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Pretty weird, huh? Maybe it's some
kinda distortion in space and time?
DS612228,Inner Thoughts,I enjoyed aimless banter

GQ00004,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems this isn't an option yet. Let's
search the area.
GQ00005,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems as though this
door won't open...
GQ00006,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hm... It looks like it requires a special
kind of key.
GQ00007,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems this door
can't be opened.
GQ8420001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It appears as though it can only be opened
from the inside.
GQ8460001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,This rail seems moveable...
We should see if there's a way
to make it move.
GQ8450001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,This door looks pretty fragile.
We may be able to destroy it with some effort
 if we give it a try.
GQ5500001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems we can't keep going from here.
Is there any way around the back?
GQ5502002,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I don't think we can get through right now.
We ought to try something else.
GQ5502004,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I think you'll need to defeat the <color=#FF423F>Shadows
in the back</color> before I can continue.
GQ5502008,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,AAAAAA==
GQ5504918,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,That treasure chest... Something about it
seems unusual.
GQ550491801,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,If I'm not mistaken, it has something to do
with the <color=#FF423F>Shadow next to it</color>.
GQ5504919,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What would a drum barrel be doing here?
Most odd. Let's investigate it.
GQ550491901,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's <color=#FF423F>slam into it</color> with everything we've
got. Who knows, there may be something
hidden inside!
GQ550491902,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoo hoot! What a haul!
GQ5504920,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Another drum...
Let's check it out.
GQ550492001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems that Shadow left something
behind when it ran off.
GQ550492002,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,<color=#FF423F>Slam into it</color> again!
GQ550492003,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoo hoo! What luck!
GQ550492004,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Keep going and I bet we'll find something
even better.
GQ5504921,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,There seems to be a crack in this wall.
GQ550492101,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Couldn't it be possible to <color=#FF423F>destroy</color> this too?
GQ550492102,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes, just as I thought. Let's take a look
inside of here.
GQ5502009,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It appears to be different from before.
GQ5502010,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,While this structure may look similar,
the aura is completely different.
GQ5502011,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems that the entrance in Mementos
vanishes once a Palace is destroyed.
GQ5502012,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's keep going. I doubt there's anything
here for us to see.
GQ5502013,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I feel as though Mementos is a bit less
warped than before.
GQ5502014,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,Exactly! You really know your stuff,
don't ya?
GQ5502017,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,These fare adjustment machines are dotted
all around Mementos, so use
whichever ones you please!
GQ5502018,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,This woman and her sales pitches... Clearly,
we have no use for this.
GQ5502019,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,Well, excuse me, darlin', but it's not just
me who benefits from you usin' them machines.
You'd regret sitting this one out!
GQ5502020,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I see. Wonder, what do you think?
GQ5502022,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,All right, I trust your judgment.
GQ5502023,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I don't really get what's going on here, but
I don't feel like she's out to cause trouble
for us.
GQ5502024,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,I'd be ever so much obliged to get a ticket,
and I bet you'd be real happy to see this
distortion fixed.
GQ550202401,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,I am a merchant, after all! Lend me a helping
hand and I promise I'll make it worth
your while.
GQ5502025,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Things seem to have changed up ahead due to
that ticket we just gave the Shadow.
GQ5502026,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's go check it out, Wonder.
GQ5502027,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What's this? I can't ascertain the reason,
but our path is blocked by some sort of
inexplicable distortion.
GQ5502028,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I say we ought to investigate.
GQ5502029,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Right. I'm kinda curious about what's going
on, too... Let's go check it out.
GQ5506001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Wonder, something about this place... It
doesn't feel right.
GQ5506002,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,These two gates of fog and the presence I

pickled takuan.

it's all about the experience, right?

C<#000000
C<#000000
 right?
MP103765,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Yeah, that's exactly it. You're pretty good
at firing back at someone.
MP103766,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You know, I bet even diversity and universal
principles come and go with the times.
MP103780,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,When I was young, people liked to get
dead drunk to show how they really felt.
MP103781,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,But are we really ourselves only after we
let loose with some alcohol?
MP103782,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Of course, I did start drinking back in
those days...
MP103783,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I'm not the classiest drinker, but it isn't
that easy to understand someone's true self.
MP103785,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Some drink to spit up what's bottled up
inside of them. Others drink to bottle
things up.
MP103786,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,People drink for different reasons.
I suppose alcohol
is a bit like a screwdriver.
MP103800,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Try to live nice and long until you're as
old as this granny here...
MP103801,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Watching the world change around you
isn't the worst feeling, you'll come to find.
MP103802,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I had a time when I thought it was cool to
buck authority and stick to my beliefs...
MP103803,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,But perhaps it's wiser to find a way to
compromise with others in a way that also
benefits yourself.
MP103804,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Live long enough to see it all and you won't
be a slave to your instincts.
MP103806,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Well, that's the tricky part. While you may
get a good view of the path ahead by
climbing a tree...
MP103807,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You gotta come down to walk it eventually.
That was the case for me as well.
MP103820,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I struggled a lot back in the day. There are
things I've gained and also lost...
MP103821,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Before I know it, I'm already a granny.
These days, there aren't many things
I still cling to obsessively.
MP103822,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I think that's normal though. But now that
the world's a more prosperous place...
MP103823,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Young people these days just don't know what
they should yearn for. Must be difficult.
MP103824,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Others can't go and tell you to start wanting
things. That's not how desire works...
MP103826,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Oh yeah? You think I shouldn't kick back
and relax now that I'm retired, huh.
MP103827,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,If that's how you feel about it though, maybe
you're right.
MP103828,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Okay, no need to hold back. You're gonna
help me out too, you know.
MP103829,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You're okay with that, right? Then
let's start...
MP103900,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,{NAME2}-kun, do you mind if I practice
my flair tricks here?
MP103901,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,It goes without saying that I won't be
making actual cocktails, of course.
MP103902,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,And if I spill anything, I'll be sure to wipe
it right up. That's good with you, right?
MP103920,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,I'm trying to come up with a new cocktail
recipe but nothing's coming to mind.
MP103921,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,If I don't narrow things down a bit first,
the cost of ingredients can get quite high.
MP103922,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Also, if I keep tasting what I make, I'll end
up totally smashed by the end.
MP103923,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,And then the recipe gets lost to the ages.
All that hard work for nothing...
MP103940,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,The names they give to cocktails can be
pretty wild, don't you think?
MP103941,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Bloody Mary, Screwdriver, and the like...
MP103942,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,They all sound like wrestling moves.
Don't you just want to scream them out loud?
MP103960,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,The flair bartending that I do also includes
duo performances.
MP103961,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,So, why not give it a go with me,
{NAME2}-kun?
MP103963,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,I'm kidding! Sorry, I just thought it
wouldn't hurt to ask, that's all.
MP103964,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Everyone's going to get the wrong idea if I
were to do it with someone your age.
MP103965,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Maybe I'll ask you again when you're
a little older.
MP103980,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Female bartenders are sometimes
called barmaids.
MP103981,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,I feel like in Japan, the word maid" has

Yu<#000000
Yu<#000000
Yu<#000000

 but her performance was beyond

 okay?
M<#000000
M<#000000
 it all keeps adding up.
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
 though...
M<#000000
 time to get in the zone.
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
 it's like all the fatigue

M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000
M<#000000

S<#000000
S<#000000

S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
 so I had to upgrade!
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
 so I'm settling for only three
S<#000000
S<#000000
 three just isn't enough.
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000
S<#000000

S<#000000

Hello there! Can I help you find something?
Oh
These days it's all about the internet
Everyone's desperate to keep up with the latest trends.
All they care about is what's new
So to see a youngster like yourself take an interest in secondhand goods...
...it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.
u
Anyway
Here you go! It's antique
This one's on the house.
Don't worry about it. Just be sure to come around again
I'll have to charge next time though. Hahah.
It's big
In that case
Here you go. Just write your name and address right there.
Thanks.
Okie doke

I agree.|I'm getting sick of this.
No need for that.|There's a camera here.
This is getting silly.|Stick to a premise!
What a sloppy performance.|He's no screenwriter...
We've got to keep going.|We'll set Miyazawa straight.
Merope?|I'm in the Velvet Room again?
Warning?|What is this about?
Potential?|What are you saying?
Ruin?|Is that some kind of joke?

Good morning...|What are you doing here?
My what?|What's a crumb festival?
Business partners?|What's the deal with this job?
Spending time with Lufel

Better head to school...
If I don't hurry
My parents are leaving for
Now that I think of it
Uh
Yeah.|Nicely spotted.
I better to hurry to school...
The train will be arriving shortly. Please wait behind the yellow line.
There is a gap between the train and the platform. Please watch your step.
Is that... Merope?
What's she doing here...?
What the heck was that...?
Are you okay?|Glad you're all right.
I looked around the platform
It's got her train pass
Maybe she headed for
Are you looking for this?|You dropped this.
Don't worry about it.|It all happened so fast.
That's right.|Nope.
Glad I was able to get it back to her.
Come to think of it
The "Persona" that Lufel
Ah!
Ow!
Mango.|Banana.|Apple.
What are you talking about?|Scary?
Menace?|Condemned?
Divine Justice?|Magatsukami?
They report on troublemakers?|Why not just call the police?
Magatsukami...
For some reason

Wait
Looks like Lufel wants to
*gasp*
Wait
Playing what?|How so?
I don't think that's it.|It's probably thanks to you.
I told her I plan to eat on
I should head to the roof...
That miso smells
Now
Please

Their desires were stolen?|It was taken from them.
Another self?|You mean like my...

No
Thanks again for your help.|Have we met somewhere before?
I seem different than before?
I do feel more determined...
Guess that means no lunch
Lufel said I should meet him
Target?|What are you talking about?
What's he doing?|Did he do that on purpose?
How pathetic.|Despicable.
It's because of his Shadow.|His Shadow's gone out of control.
Let's stop him right now.|Maybe we can reason with him.
He's after her!|I can't stand by and do nothing!
What was that?|Lufel
What the...
What... just happened?
Kiuchi hit that woman with

So that guy from earlier was...|So the guy in black who saved us...
Just like an idol duo...|And they have code names too...

I'm looking for a workbench.|Do you sell workbenches?
It's free?|Are you sure?

Hindering someone's desires...|What are you trying to say?

I feel something pecking
What do you mean "us"?|You're coming with me?
Time's ticking
Hey.
Let's let them handle it.|We shouldn't get in the way.
What just happened!?
We didn't talk.|What makes you say that?
Thank goodness.|I'm glad she's okay.
Noge-san's dream...
We're business partners.|We live together.
Sort of.|Not entirely.
I feel bad for her.|Nothing in particular.

What does it mean?|Did you figure something out?
Stealing?|So that's the job?
An item?|The root cause?
Wait
If that's what you desire.|That depends on you.
I have no idea.|Do you know what happened?
The Shadow... it was drawn
It was even able to recall
Deep down
Is there something inside?|You mentioned resting...
How do you know that?|This room feels different somehow...
Potential?|What do you mean?
My passion for life?|Infinite possibilities?
Bonds?|Strengthening my heart?
To Lufel
Can other people not see
Are you all right?|Calm down.
Yeah
What is it?|You don't look too good.
Are you okay?|What is it?
A slump?|You didn't do anything wrong.
You don't look well.|Are you sure you're okay?
Arai-san?|Snap out of it!
Arai-san!|You're alive!
That's his Shadow?|He looks totally different!
Stop!|Quit it!|Let her go!
You're wrong.|It's not her fault.
You ruined it yourself.|You threw your own life away.
You don't have to give up!|You have to follow your heart!
Got it!|Let your fury fly!
Since before the battle.|You just noticed now?
Good idea.|Let's hurry.
It's all right.|What's on your mind?
But in the Metaverse...|His Shadow was...
Welcome to the team!|Could you sit down please?
Central Street
We have our reasons.|We have a fight coming.
Let's give 110%.|Nah
I'll have to think it over.|Not sure yet.
What does that mean?|Stop exaggerating...
Oh boy...|So what should I do?
Thanks to my parents.|Nope.|I guess a little.
Part-time job?|What kind of job?|Work is for chumps.
I feel empowered.|That's an overstatement.|How should I spend my paycheck?
Where did the Shadow go?|I lost sight of the Shadow...
Peculiar?|What kind of Shadow is it?
Good morning.|You look sleepy.
Maurice Leblanc.|Juraj Jánošík.|Ryoma Sakamoto.

A place for myself?|What do you mean by that?
Fusion?|What are you gonna do?
I went through this blue door...|There was this guy with a long nose...
Sounds like amnesia.|Wow
That's right.|Let's do this.
She's exactly right.|We believe in you.|You are a little cheeky though.
What a total creep.|But she's okay now.
We don't need to watch it.|Let's keep moving.
Sounds like you had a crush on him.|You liked him a lot
Are you all right?|It's not your fault.
Let's do it!|That's the spirit!
Materialized?|What should we do?
Should we send a calling card?|How about a letter?
We should consider this carefully.|I want to think it over some more.
Let's do it.|Let's not.|I'm not sure.
Agreed.|We should bring her something too.
No problem.|Why?
For Noge!|He's going to pay.
Let's make a show of it.|We'll make sure everyone sees.
Let's send the calling card.|I need more time to prepare.
What the heck is that?
A flyer...?
What's going on!?
Sir Takeyuki Kiuchi, former baseball player... Huh?
The Phantom Thieves...
Ridiculous!
It's time to change Kiuchi's heart!|Cross that bridge when we get there.
Blaming others again?|You brought it on yourself.

Influence on hope?|We what?

This is more than enough.|Thanks for dinner.
Recover all seven Treasures?|Take on another six Palaces?
Descent into ruin...?
Nurturing desire with other
Does that mean
What's wrong with it?|Do you not like it?
Soup got in my eye!
Hiromu Miyazawa?|Some acquaintance of yours?
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|Don't mind me.
What're you implying?|What does that mean?
It isn't your fault.|Don't worry about it.
Of course.|My home is your home.
I'm just getting in the door.|Did something happen?
This is...|It's about Kiuchi's arrest.
Let's give it a shot.|If it means saving people

We didn't change Akashi's heart.|We couldn't steal Sensei's Treasure.
Fine...|But I need to prepare.

All of the wealth he had
stolen, he would distribute
amongst the poor.
Honor is that which no man
can give you, and no man can
take away.
It goes against my pride to
ignore the suffering of

this... You're going to know

Leblanc.
Huh? Oh
Follow me.
This is your room.
I'll at least give you sheets for your bed.
We'll be going to Shujin tomorrow.
It's Shujin Academy.
We'll introduce ourselves properly to the staff there.
Consider yourself lucky. There aren't many places
that would take a kid like you.
Yes
Huh? I thought I deleted this.
Welcome to my Velvet Room.
This place exists between dream and reality
I am Igor
Our paths shall soon cross again.
For now
Should you cause any trouble
Honestly
But there were some circumstances on our side...
I'm Sadayo Kawakami.
Come to the faculty office when you arrive at school tomorrow.
I'll show you to the classroom.
Yes
Sakura-san
Don't let him cause any trouble outside...
Oh? You need a ride
Ah... No...
That so? Okay...
Friggin' Kamoshida.
Kamoshida?
The guy in the car.
That was Kamoshida.
He does whatever the hell he wants...
Crap! We're cutting it close.
The rain ain't that bad.
We better hurry up
What the hell...?
Where the heck did the school go!?
Hey!
What're you just standing there for?
I'm going in.
Huh? But...
The hell is all this?
We gotta run!
Oww!
I think I broke somethin'!
Quit screwing with us
Let us outta here!
Hey! I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
No one has free reign in my castle.
Kamoshida!?
Execute them!
Open the gate!
Hey!
Run!
These guys ain't messin' around!
No...
I don't wanna die...
What's the matter?
Thou who art willing to perform
all sacrilegious acts for thine own justice!
Call upon my name
Show the strength of thy will to ascertain all on thine own...
though thou be chained to Hell itself!
Come to me!
Arsène!
No way...
You have returned Home.
Welcome back.
Returned?
Does that mean we got away?
Who knows?
Whoa
The castle's gone!
What's this about a "castle"?
Kamoshida!?
Welcome to Shujin Academy!
Good luck trying to enjoy your new school life.
Well...
I'd like to introduce a transfer student...
Ren Amamiya.
Today
he wasn't feeling well
...Nice to meet you.
Let's see
...over there.
So we gotta fight
or die trying.
All right.
Let's go.
For real?
The gymnasium...?
I know that guy.
He's on the volleyball team.
So the rumors were right...
They say Kamoshida uses corporal punishment.
Huh?
He takes out his anger on the team by hurting them.
Stop! Please!
This castle is seriously messed up!
Whatever
Gimme a hand!
Ngh! Ngh—!
Ha! Nothing but a pair of amateurs...
All right
I'm talking to you
Those people over there aren't real humans.
They're puppets that only exist in this Palace.
Fake humans
You got that?
That was helpful
Right?
Right!?
If so
then get me outta here!
What the hell!? Is that a cat?
Monster caaaaat!
I am NOT a cat!
My name's Morgana!
C'mon
See that key over there?
All you gotta do is free me.
And if you do
I'll teach you all there is to know about this Palace.
Aren't you curious?
...Deal.
Whaaat!?
Th-This ain't my fault!
Once these two are dealt with
you're next
Are you going to let him talk to you like that?
He needs knocking down a peg.
Let's take back what he took from you.
You made me wait quite a while.
You seek power
Then let us form a pact.
The skull of rebellion is your flag henceforth!
Ngh... Gah...
Aahhh!!
Right on... Wassup
This effin' rocks!
Now that I got this power...
...it's time for payback
Let's go
Arsène!
Show them your might...
Zorro!
Hmph.
Buncha amateurs...
You've got one
Now!
Let's wipe them out in one fell swoop!
After me
I hereby sentence you three to death!
Let's retreat for now!
Right!
A wise decision
Let's go!
Wait!
Takamakiiiii!
Filthy trespassers...
Dammit!
Kamoshida
You're gonna pay for this!
All right
Tonight's on me
Speaking of which
The name's Ryuji Sakamoto
but you can call me Ryuji
Renren.
Nice to meet you
Sakamoto.
Ah! Come on!
That voice...
Morgana!?
Why're you—
Wait
A talking cat!?
I am NOT a cat!
This is just the form I took when I came to this world.
I have a proposal for you two.
By using the Palace
you can change Kamoshida's heart.
For real!?
With my help
I suppose I could guide you through it.
But how thou—
Shut up and listen!
This is the important part.
Attempting a change of heart is dangerous.
Worst case scenario
Is that a risk you're willing to take?
Can't give an immediate answer
Take some time to think it over.
I look forward to your response.
See ya.
So...
In general terms...
a "premeditated crime" is...
What do ya think? About what Monamona said?
I'm curious
Yeah
Don't get me wrong
but it's not like I wanna kill him
Of course not.
There's gotta be another way.
Hey
Whoa. Is she actually...?
Huh? Is that Suzui from the volleyball team?
Everyone
Stay seated!
Hey! Where are you going!?
Return to your seats at once!
Shiho!
I'm sorry...
I... I can't take this... anymore...
Ann...
Kamoshida?
Hey! Shiho!
Someone should go with her...
Are there any teachers around?
I-I'm not in charge of her class though...
We should leave this to Principal Kobayakawa...
I'll go!
Okay
The hell are those two up to?
Huh? THIS is the Treasure?
Nope. All we're doing today is securing our infiltration route.
To steal the Treasure
Sounds like we're not the only intruders.
I knew security was a little thin...
That explains it.
Another intruder?
What's going on!?
What happened to the school?
Is this a movie set or something?
Prepare to be executed!
Are you kidding me?
Cut it out
That voice... Sakamoto!?
And you're... the transfer student?
Are you just going to give in?
We've got a score to settle.
For Suzui-san's sake.
She's your friend
Mm...
Good grief... Took you long enough.
Who is going to avenge her
if you don't take a stand here?
I am thou...
Thou art I...
Takamaki has a Persona
Ah...!
How dare you! Enough of your insolence!
No
No one's gonna stop me now!
Let's do this
You're going down in style!
Every rose has its thorns!
Th-This can't be happening!
Wait...!
Wh-What's with this suit?
Since when!?
Ooh!
D-Don't look!
We'll explain later!
Reinforcements are on their way!
Here... Gimme your arm.
You take the other side.
The Phantom Thieves of Hearts...?
That reaction from Kamoshida...
It's proof that our actions in the Palace had an effect.
How so?
You saw
The Treasure...
...It manifests when its owner feels threatened.
By sending the calling card
we should be able to steal it!
So once we steal his Treasure
Right. Let's regroup later tonight.
We'll meet at midnight
in front of the school gates!
Finally... Our Phantom Thief debut.
Gotta admit
We sent the calling card.
Failure is not an option.
That goes without saying.
Ready when you are!
Let's move.
I'm a cut above all other humans!
He's possessed by his twisted desires.
A true demon.
That's riiiiight!
I am the demon who rules this wooooorld!
Gold Medal...
Attaaaaack!
Persona!
Huh!?
Hrrrraaaaagh!
Go! Go! Kamoshi...da!
Not my crown!
Checkmate.
We did it... right?
Mr. Kamoshida...?
I have repeatedly done things that were unbecoming of a teacher.
Verbally abusing students...
Physically abusing my team...
And...
Sexually harassing female students...
The reason why Shiho Suzui-san tried to kill herself...
It's all because of me.
I am an arrogant
and shameful person.
No
I will take responsibility and kill myself for it!
Mr. Kamoshida! C-Calm down!
I—
I—
Don't run
Shiho
And everyone who turned a blind eye...
All of us...
...have to live in this reality and bear the burden of our regrets!
You have no right to run from this!
You're right...
You're absolutely right...
I should be punished under the law...
And atone for my crimes...
I officially turn myself in!
Please call the police!
So that means...
It's just like the calling card said...
Are the Phantom Thieves of Hearts legit?
That's all for today's assembly!
Return to your classes immediately!
I totally panicked when I saw the "Closed
Cus you ate too much.
What are you
Come on
Let's hurry back.
Ngh... Ungh...
Have the car ready downstairs.
We'll return to party headquarters until our meeting
with the Minister of Infrastructure.
H-Hey!
The Chief Secretary...
What did he say?
To monitor the situation
and refrain from making a statement until public opinion has cooled.
What a coward...
Perfectly content with his seat in the cabinet. A complacent old fart.
Hey
We were here first
Have they started a day care here?
You're gone for one second and the clientele completely changes.
Huh!? Get back here!
Ugh... What the hell was his deal?
No clue.
Grumpy bastard...
Walking around like he owns the place.
Hm?
Huh...
So you're a regular here
I wouldn't call her a regular.
So
Nothing...
I just like the coffee here.
Huh?
Have we met somewhere before?
My name is Goro Akechi.
You have a nice place here.
It has a real je ne sais quoi.
Akechi...?
You know...
Detectives are such ambiguous creatures.
Wouldn't you agree?
Their value isn't self-evident through mere existence alone.
No
The first is a difficult case that only they can solve.
The second is a worthy opponent at its center.
Sorry to bore you. I tend to get carried away at times.
I knew it...
He's the Detective Prince everyone's talking about.
Who the hell are you?
And why are you following us?
Simply exquisite...
Huh!?
Go on
I'm a second year at Kosei High School.
My name is Yusuke Kitagawa.
I'm an aspiring artist
Ichiryusai Madarame
You are the woman I've been searching for all this time!
I beg of you. Be my—!
Wait
H-Hold on a second!
We're in public!
Be my—
Muse! The subject of my painting!
Huh?
Madarame-sensei's exhibition will begin this weekend.
I'll be there to help out on opening day.
I can fill you in on the details then.
Yeah
I think I'll check it out...
For real!?
Lady Ann
No
It's a free ticket
Plus
Poser.
Shut it!
I see...
So the act of emptying one's mind gives rise to inner beauty.
That's Master Madarame for you!
Master. A curious word that hardly bears meaning.
Takamaki-san!
You came!
Um... yeah.
You really came.
Is that a problem?
Make sure that you don't get in the way of the other visitors.
Shall we get going?
I'll serve as your guide.
We can discuss the painting I'd like you to model for
Ah
Catch you guys later.
Oh! There it is!
The painting I wanted to see in person!
...This one?
You wanted to see this one?
Yeah!
It saw it on TV.
It left a huge impression on me.
Maybe it was the anger behind it?
I'm not sure
but I sense this burning rage behind it.
Mr. Madarame has always seemed like such a calm person in interviews
but he can paint things like this
There are much better paintings than this
Follow me.
So why did you call us here?
I'm sorry...
There's something that's been bothering me.
...Here
The post sounds like it's about Madarame.
Japanese Master Painter Plagiarizes His Apprentice's Work...!?
Now
Me?
Very well.
There's something I'd like to show you all.
The thing I wanted to show you...
...is this.
It's his debut work and magnum opus...
Sayuri.
This is the painting that inspired me to become an artist.
When I first laid eyes on you
I had the same feeling I got when I first saw this painting.
So I ask you once more...
Please consider being my model.
Forgive me
but I must assist Sensei today.
We can continue this discussion at a later date.
Guess we were wrong
Let's get outta here.
It really is a "shack
Beginning navigation.
That's Master Madarame for ya!
Plagiarism? "Abuse"?
What's wrong with that?
I provide for my apprentices
...they give me their art!
It's no different than an investment.
But lately all my apprentices
are quick to resist or flee.
All the more reason for me to break them in.
But the last one left is a true gem.
Yusuke has talent.
He also feels indebted to me.
He's mine to push around until I tire of—no
Skull.
You saw something that looked like that locked door?
Yeah.
It resembled a door in that shack in the real world.
If I remember correctly
If we can open it
then maybe the Palace door will unlock
But doing that won't be enough.
We'll also need to change Madarame's belief that the door is unopenable...
Meaning we'll need to open it right in front of him!
O-Okay...
I guess I'll get undressed
Yes
You're going to embarrass me
if you keep staring at me like that!
Could you look the other way?
Will that help?
Okay.
Hurry up!
What are you even doing!?
Sorry. I've almost got it...
Takamaki-san?
What do I even say!?
I'm home.
All right
S-Sensei!?
Yusuke?
What are you doing there!?
It's...
It's not what it looks like!
This is the real "Sayuri"!
I thought it was stolen.
I've reported you to my private security company!
If you insist on making a fuss about this...
Yusuke!
I'll turn you in to the police!
Run for it
Takamaki-san!
...Takamaki-san?
That means you two are...
Great
What is this place?
Is that...?
Madarame!?
Sensei... is that you? That attire...
My usual ragged attire is nothing but an act.
Why would a famous person ever live in a shack?
I have another residence
Why!?
Why did you forget the true meaning of art!?
What would you know about art!?
Talking down to me like you know best...
I'll shut you up here and now!
Dammit!
Your little rebellion is over!
Kitagawa-kun!
You're different from this riff raff.
My little moneymaker... A bona fide cash cow.
Did you really think I took you in out of the goodness
No
After taming you like livestock
You idiot!
I truly was blind!
Have you finally come to your senses?
It is time you teach people which is which!
Come forth!
A breathtaking sight...
Imitations they may be
but together
Though the flowers of evil blossom
Abominations are fated to perish!
You dare slander my art!? You ungrateful wretch!
I can now ascertain your true self without any reservations...
With Goemon by my side!
Ha! You truly are pathetic.
Madarame!
You shall forever rue the day
you dared defy me!
Wait!
Under the guise of authority
and went so far as to claim them as your own.
We have decided to make you confess
We will take your distorted desires without fail.
From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts!
What's the meaning of this!?
What's that?
It kinda looks like a face...
THIS is the Treasure!?
Look out!
Meddlesome vermin...
You've wreaked enough havoc in my museum.
That's...
Brace yourselves. He's about to transform!
I make the rules in the art scene!
I am the supreme being!
I am the god of the art world!
I will paint you...
...paint you out of existence!
That's...
It looks like the same thing Madarame is using!
If we can completely cover him in it—!
Allow me to handle that.
Do it.
Giving up so soon!?
Madarame!
M-My power... It's fading!
Come forth...
Leanan Sidhe!
Zorro! Let's press the advantage!
Captain Kidd!
Carmen!
You little...
I am "the"...
great Madarame!
Brace yourself...
Come forth
Uh-oh!
The Palace is starting to collapse!
We've gotta get outta here
W-Wait
What am I supposed to do now?
Put an end to all this...
...and use your own artwork for once.
I-I...
...have committed crimes that are unbecoming of an artist...
Plainly put I... p-plagiarized work...!
To the Japanese arts community...
To "Sayuri"...
And to everyone...
How can I ever make up for my...
Make up for my... transgressions?
In this press conference
has confessed to plagiarism and the abuse of his apprentices.
The police have opened an investigation
to corroborate his claims.
He has also admitted to faking the theft of his masterpiece "Sayuri"
as part of an elaborate counterfeiting scheme.
At this press conference a few days prior
it was also revealed that a group calling themselves the
The police are looking into any possible connection between these events.
Seriously though... what're we gonna do about him?
Come stay at our place!
You're a vital part of our team
It's only natural that we lend a hand!
It's kinda dirty
Why're you the one calling the shots?
And the café's only a minute walk from the station!
Not bad.
Then how about we go there now and have a party
to celebrate Madarame's change of heart!?
Good idea! We can make it a welcome party for Yusuke
It's decided!
Sorry to cause you trouble.
So
How about hot pot? A hot pot party!
I only ask that we finish it off with porridge. Extra parsley
It'll be up to you to convince the chief.
I doubt he'll take it well...
I don't mind.
Won't make much difference adding one more tenant.
Though I won't tolerate any noise or disturbances late at night.
Yes
Thank you for letting me stay.
Don't mind me!
Coming through!
Friends
D-Don't get the wrong idea!
If you guys don't get stronger
One second you're depressed
Hey
I want to take this as far as we can.
Punishing corrupt adults and helping those in need...
Only we can do that!
Ha! You can say that again!
Being a member of the Phantom Thieves will surely help me grow
both as an artist and a person.
Then I'll train you myself.
As Phantom Thieves
So
...Same here.
I'm turning off the lights.
Okay.
Night
Good night.
...What is this?
I found this flyer stuffed in my mailbox!
Housekeeping Service!
It says that a cute maid will do anything for you!
A maid
You're a dude
Right? ...Right!?
You mean... helping out at the cafe?
No
We can do it at my apartment.
The neighbors on my floor just moved out
The key is behind the mailbox
But
Studying's important and all...
but you've gotta take breaks
...Hey
Can I get in on this plan of yours?
Oh-ho! You're into this kind of stuff
Least you're honest about it
I-I'm not into it!
It's just for research!
What does it mean that they'll do "anything"?
And what's the level of service these so-called maids give?
Are they just as advertised?
This service is super shady! We have a moral obligation to investigate!
To rid this world of evil!
Rid the world of evil?
When you put it like that...
When you put it like that
Renren!
It's settled
So what's the code name for this operation? Hmm...
I've got it. Operation Maidwatch.
AKA
Nice! I like that!
Good evening! Your housekeeping service has arrived!
Crap! I've got butterflies in my stomach!
S-Same!
Oh
Um
I-I can't do this!
Sorry
Don't let her know you're in high school
I've got your back! Just... From way back!
S-Same!
I'm coming in!
Ah
In that case... I'll take my leave for the night.
Wh-Whaaat!? Just like that?
Is someone there!?
You moron!
Oh crap! Run for it
Mishima? And that voice...
Sakamoto-kun!?
So then... you really are...
Ms. Kawakami
Y-You're...!
Oh
Yes
...Who did you hear about this from?
It was Ms. Chouno
She's been all up in my business lately.
Hey... It won't be any better for you if people
Let's just pretend none of this ever happened.
I'll treat this as a cancellation so you won't have to pay anything.
Anyway
Hey... Is it really okay for us keep going?
We can't let the cops scare us outta
Is something the matter?
My ears are always open to the troubles
Seriously? Like you'd be able to help with anything...
What did the student council do to help Shiho
You're one to talk. As her friend
You were much closer to her than I ever was.
You're right... I wasn't able to help her at all.
But... Because I had friends by my side...
I was finally able to speak to her when it was all done.
I faced her and told her everything I'd been holding back!
Doesn't that count for something?
Wanting to help someone in need...
Everyone has that impulse.
Yeah
...Just make sure you show up to your classes
I take back what I said before
about whether it's really okay for us keep going.
I'd be ashamed to let it end now...
That's what I'm talking about! We haven't done anything wrong!
This is our style of justice!
Yeah.
Justice...
I have something I'd like you all to listen to...
Wh-What the hell!?
A friend of yours?
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Makoto Niijima
What's the meaning of this...?
Take a listen to this.
Hey...
Is it really okay for us keep going?
We can't let the cops scare us outta
What do you think the police would do if they heard this?
Why are you here?
Did you really come just to tell us
that you're going to report us?
I came here to verify...
this "justice" you speak of.
Right now I'm the only one who's heard this.
If you prove what you're doing is just
I'll erase this.
She wants to make a deal...
What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
There is someone whose heart I'd like you to change.
Who?
So you're not saying it's impossible.
The boss of a criminal organization.
A criminal organization!?
They operate using phishing scams and drug trafficking.
What's worse
they won't stop threatening you
until they get what they want.
Where can we meet them?
Their main hub of activity is here in Shibuya.
Junya Kaneshiro.
I think he's probably the guy you're looking for.
Kaneshiro...
You should check him out further if you're curious...
but I'm not responsible for what happens next!
There's a Palace for Junya Kaneshiro.
All that's left is figuring out where it is and what form it takes.
We'll just have to take a guess.
It's gotta be about money. The guy's name means "money castle."
He commits fraud and extortion
I'm picturing a place filled with money.
Like a bank...
Match detected.
We were right?
I've got it...
The place that Kaneshiro thinks of as a bank is...
All of Shibuya.
Woah! This is crazy!
The distortion is affecting the whole of Shibuya!
So he sees everyone in Shibuya as his patron?
W-Wait...! What's that!?
I'm... too tired... Please... let me rest...
So
Yeah.
At the very least
this is the amount of humans that Kaneshiro
This is horrible...
I see
Countless victims in all directions.
We won't let him get away with this!
But we won't be able to do anything until we can get up there.
We can't accomplish anything down here.
Let's head back for now.
Hello? It's me... Makoto Niijima.
Just stay on the line and record this call.
That idiot!
Well? What now?
I memorized the license plate!
Guess my artist's eye finally paid off.
Are you Kaneshiro?
What's this? Who did you call?
Kaneshiro-san
Deal with her.
Amamiya-kun!
What in the world!?
The hell are you doing to her!?
You better watch your mouth
Enough.
What's wrong? Why's everyone so stiff?
Debauchery of Minors at a Club.
You don't mind if I send this to your school
I feed on dumbshits like you...
Summer bonuses are around the corner
If you beg your mommies and daddies
you'll have the 3 mil in no time.
That's what all the other brats had to do.
Run your mouth to the police
and I'll break all of you
Now get out of my sight. I'm about to have some fun.
Would you like to come with us?
Go with you? Where?
To the world inside Kaneshiro's Heart.
I see... So this is how he views the world.
You want to go to that bank up there
Then let's go.
If I'm a client now...
No way!
It's just as I calculated.
Let them pass.
Kaneshiro!
I know why you're here.
It's about the 3 million yen
I have a reasonable payment plan for people like you.
Join our organization tomorrow
and pay for it with your body!
Is that how you've exploited other girls?
Eehehehe... That's the beautiful student council president for you.
Or should I say... the younger sister of
How do you know that!?
Now be a good girl and do as you're told. It'll be over soon.
Shut your damn mouth
Have you decided to tread the path of strife...?
Yes... Come to me.
Very well. Let us proceed with our contract at once.
I am thou
A Persona...?
No
I get it now...
This is my true self!
Kaneshiro!
No! We can't fight him now!
To change his heart
We know how to get in now!
Time to retreat!
Retreat? But how!?
There's only one exit.
I'm going on ahead
All right
Sir Junya Kaneshiro
You indulge in scamming others with horrendous
We have decided to make you confess
We will take your distorted desires without fail.
From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.
I-Isn't this bad?
What? The Phantom Thieves?
Like I give a shit!
He changed the room into a giant safe that quickly!?
Greetings.
Welcome to my private city bank.
You filthy fly on dirty money...
Get the hell out of my face!
Yo! Let's do this thing
Crap!
Let's do this! Carmen!
Gah!
The hell are you doing
You'll burn the whole place down!
Now!
Nue!
Crumble before me!
The place you belong... is somewhere you
You stupid brats don't get it.
Look
You'd better watch your backs for the one in the black mask.
Their power is in an entirely different league...
A black mask?
To think there's someone else out there able to enter Palaces...
We can think about that later! We need to get out of here!
Ahahaha! I can't get enough! Soooo cooool!
Didn't you hear her
You shouldn't throw animals
Whatever
Cram inside
Crap! There's no road!
Isn't this the man the Phantom Thieves sent a calling card for?
I heard he confessed all his crimes.
It was really... out of nowhere.
This would only make sense if his personality changed...
but that would be impossible.
Isn't it good enough that he's behind bars?
The issue is that no one received any credit for it.
Catching him could have landed me a promotion...
Promotion...?
You've changed
But... I'll be okay.
Huh? Where is it!?
Oh no... Don't tell me it flew away
Huh? H-How do you know my name?
Huh? It's Ayaka Sakai... Why do you ask?

COOP100011,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, eat up. Your bowl's on me. Let's talk
after it comes.
COOP100013,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Let's eat.
COOP100014,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Whew, well, that hit the spot.
COOP100015,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The broth had that dashi taste with hints of
seafood you can find in pretty much every
Japanese dish...
COOP100016,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,...but the intentional, uneven thickness of
the noodles gave the dish a unique texture
and brought it all together.
COOP100018,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, sorry. I just blurted out what I was
thinkin'.
COOP100019,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, right. When I get lost in thought, I lose
track of what's goin' on around me.
COOP100020,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I wanna open a ramen shop in the future.
A place that serves my ideal bowl of ramen.
COOP100021,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But what flavors do I think are best? The
more I think about it, the more I don't
know...
COOP100022,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If I remember right, {NAME2}, aren't your
parents traveling now?
COOP100023,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Does that mean you usually eat alone?
COOP100024,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If it's okay with you, could you help me find
my ideal flavors ?
COOP100025,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Whenever you've got time or your stomach's
gettin' grumbly is fine. We'd just follow my
nose...
COOP100026,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Then I'd ask you a question or two. You just
have to tell me what you think.
COOP100027,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Easy enough, right? And I'll even treat you
for your trouble!
COOP100029,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Good question... I know it sounds strange for
me to say it, but I'm a bit of a contrarian.
COOP100030,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,You're kind of the only one I can ask to do
this. Plus, I'm a bit of a contrarian.
COOP100031,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I don't need nuanced responses. Just tell me
if you think it's good or not.
COOP100032,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've been told by Pops a number of times
I have to listen to other people's opinions
more.
COOP100033,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But if I'm going to get the same opinion,
I should get it from someone I can trust,
right?
COOP100034,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I thought at least you wouldn't be weird with
me and have a flexible enough schedule.
COOP100035,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I thought you'd have a flexible enough
schedule.
COOP100036,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Please? How about I broach it this way... You
cook for yourself sometimes, right?
COOP100037,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'll even teach you some easy-to-make and
tasty recipes. How's that sound?
COOP100039,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I owe you big time!
COOP100040,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, I'm still on a high schooler's budget,
so go easy on me, okay?
COOP100041,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Yeah I am. No way am I lettin' you pay.
COOP100042,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I need to recoup all the time I lost doin'
this on my own. I'm definitely gonna find my
ideal flavors.
COOP100045,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, as promised, I'll teach you a recipe.
But we should leave now that we're done
eating.
COOP100200,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,......
COOP100201,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, {NAME2}! Perfect timing.
COOP100202,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm off to try somethin' new. You comin'?
COOP100204,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That settles it then.
COOP100205,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's a bit far, but I'm headin' to
Tsukishima. A place there caught my eye.
Let's go.
COOP100206,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I see... Well, maybe next time, then.
COOP100207,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Man, it feels like forever since the last
time I came to a monjayaki place like this...
COOP100209,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Nah, we're after ramen, remember?
COOP100210,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Don't you worry. We'll be slurpin' down some
noodles.
COOP100211,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,You're a regular? Then did you know about the
side menu here?
COOP100212,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sometimes you can find restaurants where the
sides are as popular as their signature dish.
COOP100213,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The ramen at this restaurant is excellent,
or so I've heard.
COOP100214,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That said... it doesn't feel right to come
to a monjayaki restaurant and not order
monjayaki.
COOP100215,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,We're gonna be eatin' ramen after this, so I
got us an order of the simplest one to split.
COOP100216,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I can go ahead and grill this bad boy up for
us, if that's okay with you.
COOP100217,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,All right. Here goes nothing.
COOP100218,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sorry, {NAME2}. I got in the zone. You see
this crater-lookin' space in the middle?
COOP100219,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That's where you pour the rest of the batter
still in the bowl. You can do the honors.
COOP100220,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've heard some people like to dump half in
first, but let's just do my favorite: goin'
all in.
COOP100221,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,All right. Shall we? I'm starving.
COOP100222,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm getting a dashi base with a hint of tea
leaves in the batter. This flavor...
Very nice.
COOP100223,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It gives the dashi a lighter taste that won't
overpower any later add-ins like sauce or
seaweed flakes.
COOP100224,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,This restaurant balances high-quality food
without sacrificin' chances to bring in a bit
more money with extra toppings.
COOP100226,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If I'm already blabberin' this much, the
ramen is probably gonna be out of this world.
COOP100227,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Totally. I haven't forgotten. Let's move on
to the main event.
COOP100228,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm tempted, but we've gotta leave room for
the ramen.
COOP100229,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Here it is... The miso butter corn ramen.
COOP100230,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The regulars here refer to it as the secret
signature dish.
COOP100231,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Let's dig in!
COOP100232,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Unbelievable!
COOP100233,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, uh, sorry. It's just that this ramen is
outrageously good!
COOP100234,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,They probably used the same dashi that was in
the monjayaki. The tea leaf flavor gives it
away.
COOP100235,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What's amazing is that it still retains its
unique taste despite the strength of the
miso.
COOP100236,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,[Redacted]
COOP100237,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It goes well with both the noodles and
corn. Versatile... A vague but accurate
description.
COOP100238,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,[Redacted]
COOP100239,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The dashi is so perfect that it can both stay
as it is or become anything else...
COOP100240,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If a monjayaki restaurant is this good,
a shop specializing in ramen has big shoes
to fill.
COOP100241,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,[Redacted]
COOP100242,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I felt the same when I tried the ramen in
Ogikubo, but I think character is key here.
COOP100243,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Ramen with character... What would my unique
spin on it would be...?
COOP100245,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,My obsession with the broth, huh...?
COOP100246,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Stickin' to the basics, huh...?
COOP100247,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I think Pops said somethin' similar. That I
can't slack off when it comes to even a basic
ramen broth.
COOP100248,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,A ramen with a focus on its dashi... Yeah,
that's exactly what I'm aimin' for.
COOP100249,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Come to think of it, I can't do anythin'
other than what Pops taught me.
COOP100250,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I was so overwhelmed by the flavors of this
place that I almost missed that...
COOP100251,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Thanks, {NAME2}.
COOP100253,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Shoot, the monjayaki is burnin'! And the
noodles are gonna lose their bounce. Let's
finish eatin' quick!
COOP100300,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,......
COOP100301,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, {NAME2}. I'm off to try somethin' new.
You comin'?
COOP100303,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, then, that's perfect.
COOP100304,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But before we go... I wanna pick your brain
a bit.
COOP100305,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Gotcha. Let's go another time.
COOP100306,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,You remember that monjayaki joint, right?
It made me think about runnin' a business.
COOP100307,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I think the best time to eat ramen is when
it's been freshly made...
COOP100308,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I mean, who in their right mind wants to eat
takeout ramen? Am I right?
COOP100310,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Good point. Maybe I'm just pickier than
most...
COOP100311,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh yeah, you've got a point there.
COOP100312,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Anyway, I decided to try out a takeout spot
I've been scoping for a while now.
COOP100313,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Smartphones are crazy, huh? You can just
phone 'em up and grab your food when
it's done.
COOP100314,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Here it is. The soupless tantanmen that
everyone's been buzzin' about.
COOP100315,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's a type of ramen called mixed noodles."

You say your gonna talk your way into taking over their ship...?

Bombing the capital will wipe out that rampaging gorilla... and the
That's your master plan!? Don't be so full of yourself!
The greatest threat to humanity isn't the gorilla... It's humanity itself!
It's all coming back to me...
What?
I can feel it. The passion from our days training
Let's run! Don't fight that idol!
Why not? I've had enough of running away.
This burning soul... yearns to be a superstar!
...But I'm nothing without my Spicy Suit!
Hmph! If you can't do it without your suit
C'mon
You dare blame me for the stress of my employees?
I don't blame you
The only way to bring about change is to reform the system and hire
I've successfully infiltrated Sensei's subconscious!
This is my mind
Sensei! Forgive me for my actions! I'll forget everything I saw
We're going to steal the world's biggest ruby...
You mean we get to be thieves? Awesooome!
That's right
You drove off the bridge to save me... I owe you my life
Now
Brother... The truth is... I'm a police officer
It's clear you aspire to rule the valley
Zen-jou-in...? Preposterous... That secret technique was lost to time!

I'm a humble salesman who plans to take over
I had no choice back then. But now
You're a spy who came here on your master's orders
No
Cheating isn't the solution! To find the key

Congratulations! A new Player None is born!
You're a national security agent? Wow... I think I'm swooning!
What happened to your family was unforgivable. I'll take you in
You'll never be alone again... I just need to complete one last mission.
You set me up! I never took the money! It was you!
You're not a cop anymore. All the cops in the country are on

Dear
I won't give up... Not on my research
Eureka! I've discovered a miracle cure for the illness
Thank you for saving my life. How can I ever repay you...?

Please

What if we send the kid? He's evolved already
With the power of the sun in my hands
I'm always prepared... but I'm afraid I won't be kicking the bucket today!

Nothing's impossible in Plantopia!

The key is to always visualize your aim.
When talking to people
I'm joking. Why aim for critical hits at
This place kind of feels like an arcade.
I'm not the type of person to get excited
All we need is a shooting game cabinet.
Shooting games at the arcade are my forte
Wouldn't it be fun if everyone here played
I'm kidding. But as the backbone of this
I first got into shooting games to improve
Both correlate to one's surgical skills.
However
Yeah. Even if I did quit medicine
Lab coats are so convenient. It doesn't
No need to coordinate outfits
To say I became a doctor for the lab coat
I'm obviously joking. Besides
You should wear one sometime. Here
Did I tell you I have an older sister?
She says I'm different lately.
According to her
Nothing feels any different
Hmm
It's fascinating to know our friendship
Are we really friends though? How would

In that case
How did a loner like me get to make such

Howdy there!
This place is kinda weird
That's why I'm glad to run into you!
Good morning? Hello? Good evening?
So you know what that means...
Yep!
The phrase to say is "howdy there"!
Oh
What're you doing right now? Oh
Then why don't we chat for a while?
Hmm... This is a hard one.
Oh
So
Boom Bang Burger's morning set
Sometimes people mistake me for someone
But I'm not at all
The place is old
You? Want to come to my place?
N-No! It's too soon for that! I need time

But sometimes I get this
I get a bad feeling that someone's trying to
No

I'm really impressed by how accomplished
I should follow their example
And study more... Mostly study more...
*sigh* Maybe someone here can tutor me?
Hmm... Do you think alcohol is really
Dad and the regulars drink it every night
Just to be clear
No drinking until age twenty
Little kids really have so much energy!
I was playing tag with them at the park
Hehe
I am exhausted
I was watching TV with the usual kids
They were running all around the room
But the second cartoons were on the
I swear they didn't move an inch until that
I could see the sparkle in their eyes! They
My school friends recommended this foreign
It was interesting
The ending was so hopeless and depressing
Guess it wasn't really for me.
Yeah... I never really thought about it
Something with a lot of laughs
Say
The neighborhood kids are staying over
What kind of food do you think little kids
Oh
My dad always wants to serve the kids
They might go well with sake
Hmm... I guess that is an option.
It's not really for me to decide what those

Something about it is calming
Oh
I noticed there were other people here
How do I break the ice?
I don't want to screw up my first impression
Did you know that flowers can have both
For example
That's exactly right. I'm impressed.
Actually
Some often take them for the latter meaning
I wish that more people would see them for
So
Did you know that according to the language
I guess it's more influenced by its fruit
Watermelon flowers are these cute and tiny
You think so?
Hmm
As far as a flower that matches its
Coffee flowers mean "let's take a break."
Coffee's the perfect thing when you want

Would you like to go?

By the way...
Where are we!?
So... This is like... your pad?
It's
Very unique!
Hello there!
...Sorry
Let's try this again.
Hello there...<sprite=1 tint=1>
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
Gather 'round
 to answer all your questions!
Let's start with... You
Nothing comes to mind...|I'll pass.
B-But why!? This is your big chance to to
Ah
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
And now for the moment you've all been
Go on
What's your favorite subject?|Got a part-time job?
Oh my! Do I look like a high schooler to you?
Ah... Hm.
No comment. Moving on!
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
And now for the moment you've all been
Anything... except questions that make me
What's your favorite food?|Thing to bring to a desert island?
Why
You can roast them
A life without spuds is truly terrible
Don't you agree?
I accidentally let Yui drag
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
Now
My question is... What is your favorite
I'm a potato lover.|Do potatoes count?
Of course
I'm a fan of potatoes myself! In fact
We really are two potatoes in a pod!<sprite=1 tint=1>
Now it's time for the goodbye greeting.
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
Pa
Well done!<sprite=1 tint=1>
I joined Yui as she waved
What's wrong?|You look scared...
Oh my! Sounds like someone's in a pickle.
What on god's green earth happened!?
Oh! Are you trying to say that you're
In that case... I recommend a good helping
Heh... Helping people help themselves...
He he he
Take it down a notch.|You're going way too hard.
Well
You
Yes
What I meant was
Of course.|She sure is.
Yui
Tongue twisters?|You're pretty good.
Ayaka and I practiced
Keyboard.|A wind instrument.|Percussion.
We talked for a while longer
I have.|Never.
I talked with Ayaka about
Someone's in a good mood.|What're you singing?
It was a nice tune.|I'd like to hear the rest.
Ayaka and I fleshed out
Yup.|Kinda.
You recognize Ayaka?|Ayaka's famous now?
Ayaka
It's good to have hobbies.|Passion makes perfect
Kira and I talked more
Really? Just for the coat?|That's so you.
Kira and I further discussed
You have a friend now.|You started hanging with me.
Kira and I discussed the
More does not equal merrier.|Depends on the relationship.
You consider me a friend?|What's gotten into you?
I listened as Kira openly
What's the matter?|Shall I lend a hand?
In the end
I'd like to see.|Can I come over?
Runa steadfastly refused my
It's all in your head.|You're overthinking it.
Runa remained convinced of
Of course.|Hit me.
Maybe next time.|That'd take two full nights.
Runa kept begging until
Sorry
I'm not entirely sure what
That's great.|Oh
Tomiyama kept gushing over
Things happen in life.|Hey
Tomiyama seems as
No comment.|Take a guess.
Really?|I don't get it.
Tomiyama ended up asking
That's rough.|Sounds like a workout.
Minami and I talked about
Was it that good?|I guess they liked it.
Minami and I chatted about
I know the feeling.|You prefer happy endings?
I recommended some
Salisbury Steak?|Omelette rice?
You could make both.|Let the kids choose.
I told Minami about
I do.|Not so much.
Kurotani and I had a lengthy
I do.|Not so much.
Kurotani and I chatted
I'm more of a paperback person.|I prefer e-books.
Kurotani and I discussed
Sometimes.|Not really.
I get it...|Take a chill pill.
Kurotani recommended a number
Probably country of origin?|Just gotta memorize 'em.
Yaoling asked me questions
Miso soup.|I grate it into a condiment.
Yaoling and I continued talking
What about croquette burgers?|How about okonomiyaki meals?
Yaoling and I came up with
White and black are a thing?|I don't know the difference.
Yaoling and I made plans for
You don't look like one to me.|Stubborn yet stunning.
You're cute today
Yaoling
We're not old enough to drink.|Yaoling is underage
Sounds like a great idea.|I'd love to try it.
Yaoling
Joy?|Betrayal?
That seems just right.|What a lovely contrast.
Once I'm done with everything.|Could you wait a bit?
I don't really have time...|Seems like a lot to remember.
What're you talking about?|You seem to be having fun.
I ended up agreeing to play
What's going on?|Something bothering you?
Kotone and I discussed what to
Ooh
The two of us designed a
Is that so?|Like what?
Kotone kept the figure skating
Is something wrong?|Tired?
We'll find a low-calorie cake.|We should share one.
Kotone and I discussed what
Why not check with your phone?|Isn't there an app for that?
Kotone seems to have managed
What makes you say that?|That's not true at all.
Kotone and I talked at length
I'd like to try those.|There are others too.
Kotone and I had a spirited
I agree.|You think so...?
Why not press them?|Take up flower arrangement?
Kotone and I continued to talk
I agree.|I can't wait for the next one.
Is it run by someone you know?|How do you know them?
Our conversation about
Teamwork makes the dream work.|I like lone heroes.
Kamiyama and I talked about
There's a lot to this.|I never imagined.
Kamiyama shared his vast
Of course.|The big costumed mascot?
Kamiyama told me his theories
You think so?|What do you mean?
I think that's normal?|You look like you to me.
Kamiyama and I reaffirmed
What is this about?|You two are friends now?
I still don't get it.|You two have fun.
Kamiyama
Not exactly...|I'd get a little scared.
Yukimi and I ended up talking
Duck tape.|All intensive purposes.
Yukimi and I shared our
That's deep...|Talk about confusing.
I got a sense of what Yukimi
This is getting complicated.|You're saying you've grown?
Yukimi seemed unaware that
You weren't listening.|I wouldn't call that relaxed.
What's that supposed to mean?|Then what is she like?
I introduced Yukimi to
You mean the statue?|The one by the station?
Haruna proceeded to tell me
There's a soccer club.|We have a band club.
Haruna and I discussed what
That mascot thing?|I think I've seen it.
Haruna took me on a deep dive
It's in Shimokita.|I take the train there.
I'll visit you in America.|I'll aim for the same college.
Haruna and I discussed what
I think she likes you.|You're already best friends.
As their mutual friend
A classic sweet one.|Something filling and savory.
Tomoko and I carried on
Just share your passion.|As long as you're polite...
Tomoko and I had fun
Usually
Tomoko and I continued
Glasses are better.|Contacts
A new style could work.|You look great the way you are.
Tomoko was lost in thought
What're you doing?|Let's gooo!
Hyped?|But why?
We continued to hype
Yeah
Chizuko gave me an earful
Is that really true?|Then why do you drink?
I'm not sure if Chizuko is
You just sit back and watch?|How do you know what's right?
I listened as Chizuko spilled
Then lead by example.|Show them what it's like.
Feeling sober
But I'm a total beginner...|I don't feel ready.
Shiina regaled me with
Maybe you should wear it.|I'd love to see you in one.
It took a while to clear up
Worried about a rival?|Can't lose to her.
Afterward
I think they can really chug.|They're probably weaklings.
Can't wait to see you drunk.|Bet you're quite the handful.
Shiina lectured me on
What're you watching?|Research?
Miyu and I looked up ways
Are you okay?|Take your time.
Miyu and I talked about what
I'll look into it.|Do we need them?
Miyu and talked about
A fashion show?|Sketch comedy?
I'm happy you're happy.|Can't wait for the show!
Miyu and I brainstormed
What happened?|You seem stressed.
Seiji and I pondered together
No
So it's the same book?|What changed?
I listened to Seiji go on
Must be rough.|Gonna buy another five?
I somehow managed to
What's wrong?|You look sad.
Fast way to lose your memory.|Drink till you drown?
I guess Shiratori's problem
Need excitement?|It's too boring?
Can't deny that.|Guys do
You're a good listener.|Must've been awkward.
Not really.|I have a few.
It's a way to show support.|Maybe they're all good.
What's going on?|Couldn't care about what?
Sumi-san is quite... unique.|You shouldn't listen to him.
You should know when to stop.|Stop teasing the poor kid.
I gave Ashiya a stern warning
What's going on?|Something bothering you?
Tomoko and I discussed good
Melon.|Blue Hawaii.
Tomoko and I had an
A traditional inn.|A shrine.
We continued talking
What's wrong?|You got sunburned?
It really doesn't bother me.|I think it's cute.
Tomoko continued explaining
Oh
Oracle was with me just a moment ago
If you have a message
No matter how many times I come here
It's not like a cognitive Metaverse
No
At the end of the day
Hey
Is that a character from your world? I'd love
It kind of reminds me of Buchimaru-kun
Oh! Good to see ya
I've just been looking around since there's
Whoa
This space is seriously huge. Oh! Does this
First up is the Neo-Featherman figure. Then
And I can't forget my mini fridge either!

If it's okay with you
I know I should stop Mona-chan and Cattle
I don't know... I find myself not wanting to
I can't get enough. I just want to see more
Do you ever have the same thought?
When I see Queen in battle
Driving around on Johanna looks like so
Oh
Oh
This is a curious space. It resembles a

Perhaps I should ask her to teach me a
Care to join me?
......
Oh
If you're planning to check on everyone
Hello there
I just got here myself. I umm...
I'm still not very familiar with this place.
Right... Point my fingertips more... I need
Oh
Since I excel at bold
I know! If it's okay with you
Just now
Was that... a saxophone? Maybe? It sounded
It was a lovely sound. I'd love to hear
Learning a new weapon?|You talking about working out?
Not a bad idea.|Yum...
Sushi? Yes please.|I can't wait.
What's wrong?|Stop fighting.
I asked what was going on
We all like different things.|Taste is subjective.
Now
What're you talking about?|A hippo's about three tons...
Why not change it up?|How about a trade?
Red bean bun.|Miso-flavored peanuts.
Because it's the Metaverse?|Maybe you're gifted?
Lemme guess...|You mean...
Give it your all!|I'll be watching.
I watched Soy make
You wanna note something down?|Like pen and paper?
Hmm... That can be useful
What's this about?|Memorizing what?
She asked if I could help her with some
If you can't write it down... You could try
If you try to memorize only the formulas
Let me join you.|Need help handling Closer?
Hehe
Queen taught Closer and I
I wonder if I'll still
Huh... So
Is this about food?|You seem hungry...
We tend to think of them being pickled to
True. They're just as good in drink form.
Relieving fatigue
I'm quite curious about that plum rice you
Which would you want to try
Plum juice.|Plum rice.
That said
Heh heh heh! If that's what you want...
Oh?|What are you planning?
You can apprentice under me!
I was joking
It'd probably be quicker to learn by doing.
As if there is.|Don't ask me...
Tch.
Well
Hacking may be useful in the Metaverse
And besides
Yeah
Not really

It's a lot of work to take care of them
Minestrone?|Ratatouille?
I also recommend adding lots of cabbage.
Ratatouille certainly contains a lot of
Hehe. All right Closer
Oh! If we did that
Wow... So phantom thief outfits outfit can
I really like your usual look
I second that.|It suits you.
If it were me...
Hmm... I think it would be nice to dress up
But even if it were to change to something
Maybe it'd be like Queen's?|Something like Closer's?
I really love that big hood. And the color is
But I have to say that I really admire the
No
What's going on?|Is this about Violet?
Oh hey
We're trying to figure out what it possibly
At first I thought it was a Shadow
I thought maybe she was mistaken. But if
Any other details?|Where did she see it?
So
So
Of course.|I'm in.
Come to think of it
I should go mention this
Wonder-senpai
Ah
What do you have to do?|We have something similar...
There's a place like that.|We've got something similar.
Oh
You say it's similar... So what's different?
I just know I can beat it!
Shocked?|You mean it was big?
Hey
Joker-senpai!
Violet appears to have
Cattle looks like an animal of sorts
Nothing really...
But you said that you can't fly in that form
Which is it exactly?
He can.|No
So
You maybe do it like this?
I love meat
Hey
Grilled frankfurters! You're quite the
 Cattle!
Oh wow! That sounds like something a phantom
So
Yakitori...|Boiled eggs...
Wait...
Oh
However
I-I suppose so?
I had a very hard time
It's hard to describe how
What is this?|Tell me what you found.
What is this place...?
You were waiting?|Why?
What a bizarre phenomenon...
If true
Will this cost money?|How do I use it?
Is that what this does?|How do you use it?
A home theater?|I think it plays movies.
There's just this one?|Looks a bit lonely...
A table and four seats...?|Don't tell me...
A hunch?|Please
How can I find them?|Are they here today?
