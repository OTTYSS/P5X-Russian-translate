I am Merope
The Velvet Room exists between dreams and reality
In order to avoid the impending ruin
Our relationship...? I am to devise a special contract for you to fulfill. Are you seeking a different kind of relationship?
My upper body strength...? It wouldn't be difficult to demonstrate
Please be aware that I cannot provide any more information about my master than what you currently know.
A rising idol with a knack for character creation
I'm Motoha Arai. My codename is Closer. Nice to meet you again!
Me? Hmmm... I guess I tend to follow my gut. But maybe that also means I might not be great at thinking things through. Ahaha...
I need to get back in shape for running around in the Metaverse. But I worked pretty hard today
If I hadn't met you
Only the Phantom Thieves can change the hearts of people with twisted desires
I've gotten used to him and all
Tomoko is my closest friend. We've been battery mates since little league
???
???
???
???
???
???
My name is Lufel. Codename: Cattle. Remember it.
Sorry
My memory is currently incomplete. I understand the way to regain it is to steal the distorted desires
We are business partners working together as members of the Phantom Thieves. Hoohoo
The Phantom Thieves of desires... I have entrusted you with the role of leader while I focus on my own objectives.
Clinging to past glories
It was a pleasant surprise to discover another Persona-user besides us. Although her somewhat loud personality may not be a perfect fit for our covert operations
Shun Kano. But around here
Am I... hard to approach? I guess I feel that way now and then. It's not that I hate talkin' to people or anything
I believe in pursuing the perfect flavor. That's how it's always been
Come to think of it
I never thought I'd be a phantom thief. If Pops knew
I mean
Huh? That came outta nowhere... She's not aimin' to be a chef
Kiyoshi Kurotani. Codename: Key. It's not "Ki" like Kiyoshi
Seeing as we are fellow chosen ones
Someday
When it comes to Take-kun
My name's Yaoling Li! I'm from Sichuan
I'm still not great at Japanese... I'm always making tons of mistakes. Just be patient with me
I could've just kept studying back home in China
The whole thing that "people from Sichuan love spicy food" is just a stereotype
Sensei
Yukimi-san seems like she's really been held back by always following the rules
Are you interested in Chinese tea
I'm Tomoko Noge. Nice to meet you.
Talent? I don't think I have anything I'm really good at. Sometimes I worry about how I should live my life without baseball.
Giving up baseball was tough
I used to be a catcher. Huh? I don't look like one?
Isn't it fun working lots of part-time jobs together? Thanks for always giving me advice. I'm counting on you!
Motoha is really popular. She's earnest
Kano-kun? Yeah
What's up? I'm Kayo Tomiyama! So
Yeah
I may be an adult in terms of age
Do you like my fashion sense? Oh
When I talk to you
Whenever I see that kid
Gah
My name's Yui! If you've got any questions about the virtual world
You want to know more about me? Well... I am who I am! What you see is what you get! If you don't believe me
I want to get a huge plot of land
Well
Farm work requires two things: physical stamina and love! You've got to work hard to till the soil
Not long ago
Come to think of it
Hello
What I'm good at
Well
My high school memories... Well
Thanks for always being there for me. As long as you're here
Make both of our dreams come true... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still worried about that. But... I'm going to do what I can.
I want to keep on singing. For my friends
I'm Yumi Shiina. I work as a bartender in Shibuya
I was in a dance club back in college
Yeah
The flavor
I'll never forget the feeling of leaping across the stage
Your mocktail-mixing skills are getting better every day... I can't let myself lose! The apprentice must not surpass the master! Just you wait
I think about it once in a while. If I'd never met you... I definitely wouldn't enjoy dancing anymore
