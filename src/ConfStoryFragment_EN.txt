1	That day... I was late getting home that night. I witnessed a drunken man aggressively harassing a woman.
I couldn't just ignore it	 so I stepped in to stop him. However—
Damn brat... I'll sue! | Even though I did what was right	 I was forced to leave my hometown and move to Tokyo by myself. Did I do something wrong after all...?	That day	 even though I did what thought was right...
I was sued and forced to move to Tokyo...
2	I arrived at Café Leblanc.
As I opened the door	 there was a pleasnt ding from a bell.
The owner of Leblanc slowly stood up and introduced himself as Sojiro Sakura. | Sojiro is my guardian while I'm in Tokyo. For the next year	 until my "probation" is lifted	 I will be living on the second floor of this shop. | And for that year	 I will be attending Shujin Academy. Sojiro Sakura warned me	 "If you cause any trouble	 you'll be sent to juvenile hall."	The owner of the café is called Sojiro Sakura.
I will be staying here for the next year.
4	As the female student entered the car	
only a vulgar boy remained...
Dammit... Screw that pervy teacher!
Who does he think he is—the king of a castle?
It looks like he's a Shujin Academy student too.
It also seems like he has a lot going on right now. | "This rain ain't too bad. We better hurry up	 or we'll be late." Despite his appearance	 he seems like a good guy. I started heading toward the school with him...	While we were walking to school...
Something strange happened.
3	AAAAAA==	On the first day of school	 it rained heavily.
Seeking shelter from the rain	 I ended up beside another student...
5	AAAAAA==	A castle appeared right before our eyes.
Is this really the school?
