1059015	Nice going.	AAAAAA==	Ann Takamaki	AAAAAA==

1060006	There might be a Shadow
somewhere 'round here. Don't get sloppy.	AAAAAA==	Ryuji	AAAAAA==

1061011	Hm? Could there be a secret
path in this room?	AAAAAA==	Morgana	AAAAAA==
1061012	Now then	 what do we do from here?	AAAAAA==	Morgana	AAAAAA==
1061013	Hrm	 this door won't open...	AAAAAA==	Morgana	AAAAAA==

1062005	Phew	 we can rest here.	AAAAAA==	Makoto Niijima	AAAAAA==
1062006	Shadow ahead. Take caution.	AAAAAA==	Makoto Niijima	AAAAAA==

1062008	That completes the job. Is everyone okay?	AAAAAA==	Makoto Niijima	AAAAAA==
1062009	There might be something important here.
Why don't we look around?	AAAAAA==	Makoto Niijima	AAAAAA==
1062010	Yes! Excellent find!	AAAAAA==	Makoto Niijima	AAAAAA==
1062011	I'm feeling a breeze.

1065002	Oooh	 there's a safe room.
Should we take a rest?	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065003	Shadow detected. Several	 actually. Be careful.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065004	No Shadow readings.
It's relatively safe here.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065005	That spot's fishy! Watch out!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065006	There's a chest we haven't opened here.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065007	Heh	 piece of cake!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065008	There! Getting a Treasure reading nearby!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065009	Let's go.
We've got a lot of work ahead of us today.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065010	Target reached!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065011	Oooh	 nice job.
Nothing beats a good day's work.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065012	We're here.
So... what's next?	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065013	Hmmm... This room's suspicious.
A hidden path	 maybe?	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065014	It's locked! Maybe we
can open it from behind.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065015	This one doesn't open.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065016	There's a strong enemy around here!
They seem seriously tough... Be careful!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065017	We've been exploring for a while...
Should we take a break soon?	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065018	We've reached a good stopping
point. Should we regroup and
review our intel?	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065019	All right	 we've gathered all the information in this area!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065020	Whoa	 we've got a lot of tickets!
We should be able to go to a new map.	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1065021	We've found a secret area!	AAAAAA==	Futaba Sakura	AAAAAA==
1066001	This is not looking good!	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066002	Got to get refocused...	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066003	This is our destination.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066004	There's a safe room over there.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066005	We won't be found by the enemy here.
Let's get organized.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066006	Enemy spotted. Let's proceed with caution.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066007	It seems to be locked.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066008	I'm glad we were able to finish things smoothly.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066009	What's that...?	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066010	Whoa	 look at that...	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066011	There's something strange about this room...	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066012	So	 what's next?	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066013	It won't open... We shouldn't
try forcing it either.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066014	What could be inside...?	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066015	We made it back safely.
Let's do our best next time too!	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066016	That's a strong enemy... What should we do?	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1066017	Don't overdo it.
Let's take breaks as needed.	AAAAAA==	Seiji Shiratori	AAAAAA==
1067001	Perhaps I... miscalculated?	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067002	Proceed with caution.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067003	Here we are. Now then...	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067004	There's a safe room. Perfect timing.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067005	Let's take a break and reorganize.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067006	It's an enemy! Be on your guard.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067007	It's locked?	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067008	Mission complete.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067009	According to my calculations	
there should be some quality
items nearby.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067010	Not a bad outcome.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067011	There must be a secret path somewhere...	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067012	So far	 so good.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067013	Seems it won't open.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067014	Let's see...	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067015	Mission complete. Let's call it a day.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067016	This enemy seems very strong.
Let's be cautious.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1067017	We should rethink our strategy.	AAAAAA==	Yukimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
1068001	I may need to pace myself...	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068002	Is everyone ready?
Let's go.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068003	Here we are.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068004	There's a safe room.
Let's take a little rest.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068005	What should we do next?	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068006	Shadows ahead. Proceed with caution.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068007	This door is locked.
Can we get in from the other side?	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068008	Mission complete!	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068009	It's a treasure chest. Let's open it!	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068010	Oh	 this seems pretty good.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068011	I hear wind... There might be a hidden passage nearby.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068012	We're here. What's next	 Wonder?	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068013	It doesn't look like we can get through here.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068014	I wonder what's inside. Let's see!	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068015	Good work. Remember to cool down.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068016	A strong enemy... Think we can handle it?	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1068017	We should rest.
Be careful not to put too much strain on your body.	AAAAAA==	Kotone Montagne	AAAAAA==
1069001	No! The invincible hero	
Leo Kamiyama	 cannot fall yet!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069002	Heroes assemble! Let's move out!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069003	Oh? Is this our destination?	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069004	No enemy readings over there. Want to
check it out?	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069005	Let's stop to recharge. Then
we'll continue our fight
against evil.	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069006	An enemy! Let's hit them with all we've got!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069007	Even heroes need to take a detour sometimes...
Let's go find the key.	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069008	Nice! We did it!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069009	Hero senses activate! There
seems to be treasure nearby.	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069010	Just as I thought. Nailed it!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069011	Hero senses tingling... There's a hidden passage around here.	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069012	I'm getting pumped! Let's go!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069013	Dang	 what the heck!?
It won't open!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069014	It must be something that'll make me stronger	 right?	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069015	Big haul today. Let's keep it up!	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069016	What an intimidating presence!
Must be a formidable opponent.	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1069017	Learning to stay
well-rested is also part
of being a hero.	AAAAAA==	Leo Kamiyama	AAAAAA==
1070001	*sigh* I feel quite tired...	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070002	Now then	 let's begin the infiltration.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070003	So	 this is our destination.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070004	Ah	 a safe room.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070005	Say... why don't we rest a little?	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070006	Enemy ahead.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070007	It seems to be locked.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070008	So this completes our job?
I see... Very interesting.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070009	What is that?	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070010	Not a bad result!	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070011	This structure... There could be a hidden passage.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070012	We've arrived. What do we do from here?	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070013	Hmm... Seems like we can't get in this way.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070014	What's in here?	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070015	Well then	 see you.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070016	It seems to be a fairly strong opponent. Stay alert.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1070017	Setting the pace for the team
is one of the leader's
responsiblities.	AAAAAA==	Akechi	AAAAAA==
1075001	Are you guys exhausted	 or is it just me?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075002	Time to get goin'.	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075003	Are we here?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075004	Should we take a short break?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075005	I could use a rest.	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075006	There's a Shadow.	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075007	It won't open... Do we need a key for this?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075008	Nice work!	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075009	Hey	 shouldn't we get that?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075010	Don't mind if I do!	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075011	Isn't there any way to get through?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075012	Where are we...?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075013	Nope... Doesn't look like it'll open.	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075014	What do we got here?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075015	I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075016	Looks like a tough one...	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1075017	Pushin' yourself too hard is no good	 you know?	AAAAAA==	Shun Kano	AAAAAA==
1076001	I might not make it...	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076002	Let's stay focused!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076003	Here we are! Let's be careful	 okay?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076004	There's a safe room. Want to take a break?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076005	Let's go over our situation.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076006	Enemy up ahead! Watch out!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076007	It's locked...	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076008	Phew... Mission accomplished.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076009	Look! I bet it's something good!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076010	Now that's worth celebrating!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076011	I think there's a passage nearby...	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076012	What should we do next?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076013	It won't open...	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076014	I wonder what's inside.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076015	That's it for today. Good job	 everyone!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076016	Oh no	 a strong enemy...
What should we do...?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076017	Are you okay? Why don't we take a little break?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076101	I'm not feeling so great...	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076102	Let's get going!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076103	We're here!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076104	There's an Oasis! Just kidding.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076105	Phew. Wouldn't mind cooling off in a safe room.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076106	Enemy spotted. We should probably be careful.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076107	Is it locked?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076108	Got it done!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076109	I wanna know what's inside.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076110	Wow	 that's incredible!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076111	I feel a breeze... Is there a hidden path there?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076112	Whoa	 we're already here!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076113	Hmmm	 it won't open.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076114	What is it? Something good?	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076115	That was pretty fun! See you next time!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076116	A Shadow... And it looks strong. We should proceed with caution.	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1076117	I'm getting a bit thirsty.
Let's go grab a drink!	AAAAAA==	Tomoko Noge	AAAAAA==
1077001	Um... Is now a good time to heal?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077002	I hope this can provide some fleeting amusement.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077003	Is this the place?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077004	You can't neglect your rest.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077005	The chosen one's sanctuary... I mean	 safe room.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077006	A Sh-Shadow!?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077007	It's locked...	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077008	I saw that one coming from miles away.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077009	Hm? Is that the unmistakable aura of a rare item?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077010	The chosen one will surely make the most of it.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077011	I feel we are being guided by the unseen...	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077012	Is this our first time here?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077013	It doesn't seem like we can open it...	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077014	Aren't you curious about what's inside?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077015	If ever you need my power	
call upon me again.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077016	I sense a formidable enemy approaching.
Is it time to use... that power?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1077017	Even chosen ones need their rest.
Why don't we take a break?	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1078001	I'm reaching my limit...	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078002	All right	 let's get going!	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078003	This is the place.	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078004	Safe room!
Looks like we can take a break here.	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078005	Phew! Now we can relax.	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078006	Shhh! There's a Shadow!	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078007	Uh	 it's locked.	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078008	All done!	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078009	I smell treasure!	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078010	Makin' bank!	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078011	Is there a secret passage around here?	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078012	Here we are!	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078013	Hmmm	 it won't open...	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078014	What's inside?	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078015	All right	 let's go home.	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078016	It looks pretty strong...	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1078017	They say that balancing work and rest gives twice the results with half the effort.
Isn't it about time we rested yet?	AAAAAA==	Yaoling Li	AAAAAA==
1079001	Keep an eye on that HP and SP!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079002	Hey	 hey! I see a place where we can chill!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079003	Whoa	 it's Shadow City around here!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079004	Woohoo	 no enemies here! ♪	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079005	Uhhh	 this looks dicey.
Is it a trap?	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079006	Treasure chest nearby! Check it! ♪	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079007	Hm	 maybe you'd better find a detour?	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079008	Look! Treasure! It's so shiny!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079009	Let's get this party started!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079010	Mission complete!
Booyah!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079011	Alrighty then	 we're here!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079012	Go	 go	 go!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079013	Hmmm	 gettin' some "secret passage" vibes here!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079014	It's locked? How annoying!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079015	Ugh. It's not opening!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079016	What the what now!? That one looks strong	 doesn't it?	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079017	You're not planning an all-nighter	 are you?
Let's take five!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079018	Booyah! That's what I'm talkin' about!	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079019	Been there	 done that... Shouldn't we move on?	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079020	We're absolutely rolling in tickets!
We should be able to go somewhere new.	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1079021	Hm? I think there's something here.	AAAAAA==	Kayo Tomiyama	AAAAAA==
1086001	Sorry	 I'm a bit tired...
Can we take a break?	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086002	Let's give it our best effort. Within reason	 of course.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086003	Well then...	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086004	Let's rest before we get too tired.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086005	*sigh*
It's so comfortable	 I don't wanna leave.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086006	Here's our chance to strike first.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086007	The door is locked.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086008	I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086009	Treasure chests are so exciting	 aren't they?	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086010	This is very nice.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086011	This room feels suspicious somehow.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086012	We all deserve a nice long vacation.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086013	Doesn't seem it'll open so easily...	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086014	I hope it's something good.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086015	I'm a bit tired	
but it was an interesting experience.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086016	I did the best I could	 I suppose.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086017	It looks really strong... Are we still going to fight it?	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1086018	No need to push yourself so hard.
Even phantom theives need a break... right?	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1087001	We're still in danger. We should heal.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087002	It's a safe room. Let's make use of it.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087003	Shadows ahead.
There are quite a few	 so let's proceed with caution.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087004	There don't seem to be any
shadows around. Let's keep
going.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087005	Something feels off. There might be a trap.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087006	It looks like there's a treasure chest...
I'll leave the decision to you	 Wonder.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087007	I see	 an interesting lineup...	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087008	The Treasure is close...
Everyone	 are you ready?	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087009	Let's get exploring.
Everyone	 stay sharp.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087010	This looks like our destination. What's next?	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087011	Mission accomplished. Good job	 everyone.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087012	Seems we've arrived. Where should we start?	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087013	I detect a hidden passage. Try to find it.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087014	Looks like it's locked.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087015	Seems it won't open... Let's find another way.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087016	I've detected a strong enemy.
Stay vigilant.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087017	Long periods of concentration are inefficient.
How about taking a break soon?	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087018	We did it. Let's keep up this momentum.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087019	We've fully explored this area.
Great job.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087020	We've accumulated quite a few tickets.
Should we go redeem them soon?	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1087021	Thought they could hide	
did they? Nothing escapes
my gaze.	AAAAAA==	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
1088001	Taking care of your health is important too	 you know!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088002	Oh	 a safe room.
Want to take a break?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088003	That's a lot of enemies... Will we be okay?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088004	It seems like there aren't too many enemies.	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088005	I have a bad feeling about this...
It's a trap! Everyone	 be careful.	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088006	There's something good nearby.
Let's try to find it!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088007	Oh. What do we have here?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088008	There's something super powerful ahead!
What could it be?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088009	Let's go!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088010	Here we are! 
This is the right place	 isn't it?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088011	Great job today!
Let's work hard together next time too!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088012	So	 what's next from here?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088013	There's a hidden passage here.
Nothing gets past Nemertes!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088014	Looks like it's locked...	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088015	Huh? It won't open.	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088016	That one is definitely strong... What should we do?	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088017	Um	 big bro...
I think it's about time you took a break.	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088018	You're doing great	 just so you know!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088019	If the map says we're here	 then it should be... Uh...	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088020	It looks like you've gathered a lot of tickets.	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1088021	Nothing gets by me!	AAAAAA==	Miyu Sahara	AAAAAA==
1089001	Oof	 this might be bad...	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089002	Here we gooo! This is so exciting!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089003	Goal!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089004	We can rest over there!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089005	Let's take it easy!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089006	Shhh! We'll get caught!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089007	It won't open without a key.	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089008	Exploring was fun!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089009	Ooh	 I bet there's treasure around here!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089010	We found the treasure!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089011	This room's pretty suspicious...	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089012	Whoa! So fast!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089013	Why won't this door open?	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089014	I wonder what's inside!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089015	That went well!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089016	I want to come back and play again!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089017	That enemy looks really strong!	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1089018	If we don't rest soon	
we won't have energy to keep exploring.	AAAAAA==	Haruna Nishimori	AAAAAA==
1090001	This situation seems dire...	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090002	Now then	 let us give it our all!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090003	We've arrived. Now then...	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090004	Safe room!
Just when we needed it	 too.	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090005	Let's take a break.	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090006	It's a Shadow... What shall we do?	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090007	It's locked.
It seems we won't be able to open it from here.	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090008	Hard work equals bountiful harvest!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090009	My intuition says
that there's treasure nearby!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090010	Ah! It's just what I wanted!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090011	There must be some way we can make progress...	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090012	Traesto! ♪
We've arrived!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090013	It's shut tight. Shall we take another route?	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090014	I sense a most excellent harvest!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090015	Simple as that!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090016	Let's call it a day!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090017	Oh?
I feel a very unpleasant presence.	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1090018	I'm exhausted!
I request a short break	 please!	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
1100001	I... can't move...	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100002	Hope it's something good!	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100003	Here.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100004	Safe room! Should we rest a bit?	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100005	Let's take a break. We should mind our health.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100006	The enemy... Be careful.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100007	It's locked...
Let's try and figure out
how to get it open.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100008	Great job	 everyone!
No one twisted their ankle	
right?	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100009	Seems like there's
something good nearby...
Let's look for it together!	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100010	Yep	 this is pretty good!
This should help everyone out.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100011	It looks like there may be another path.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100012	Made it safe and sound.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100013	We can't get through here? Let's try somewhere else.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100014	I really hope it's something good!	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100015	All finished!	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100016	I'm glad we made it back
safely! Nice work	 everyone.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100017	That one looks difficult! Don't push yourself too hard.	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1100018	It's great you're working
hard	 but don't forget to take
 a break	 okay?	AAAAAA==	Minami Miyashita	AAAAAA==
1110001	Granny's not as spry as she used to be.	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==

1110003	We've made it. This is the place	 right?	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==
1110004	This is a safe room	 right?

1110005	Phew. This is too much at my age.	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==

1110008	Well done indeed! Very nice work.	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==

1110013	Looks like it might be a good idea to call it here...	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==
1110014	Wonder if something good's in there...	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==
1110015	Nice job	 you worked pretty hard today!	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==
1110016	It seems this is as far as we can go for now.	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==
1110017	It's normal to hit a few
walls while you're young...
But I won't lose.	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==
1110018	Glad to see you're energetic	
but keep your elders in mind
and give us a break	 would you?	AAAAAA==	Chizuko Nagao	AAAAAA==

1131312	As for this next mission... uhh	 no comment.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131313	This is a tactical retreat... I think...	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131314	Even if you tell me to come back all of the sudden...!	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131315	This	 too	 is the fate
of a chosen one	 isn't it...	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131316	I knew it had to be this way	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131317	The chosen one will surely make the most of it.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131318	I haven't even gotten
started yet.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131319	If you need my power	
call on me again.	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131320	It seems I truly am the chosen one	 after all!	AAAAAA==	Kiyoshi Kurotani	AAAAAA==
1131401	Guess it's my turn.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131402	Perhaps I should show you my mature side once in a while.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131403	The pen is mightier than the sword	 you know.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131404	I'll keep doing my best.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131405	It seems I was able to live up to everyone's expectations...	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131406	It's a bit of a hassle... but I guess there's no other option.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131407	Let's do our best without pushing ourselves too hard.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131408	Ahh	 what a beautiful day. It's the perfect weather for fishing.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131409	I'll treat it like a research trip.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131410	Maybe I should show my motivated side now and again.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131411	No matter the situation	 always keep a clear mind.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131412	I did the best I could	 I suppose.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==

1131416	All thanks to everyone.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131417	It might be nice to go on a trip once in a while.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==

but it was an interesting
experience.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131419	This is very nice.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
1131420	I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.	AAAAAA==	Toshiya Sumi	AAAAAA==
