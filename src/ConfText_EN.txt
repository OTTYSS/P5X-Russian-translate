1050039	About Refunds
1050040	About Charges
1050041	<sprite=0 tint=1> During the Persona5: The Phantom X trial period	 the total amount charged will be refunded after the game's official release according to the Charge Refund Rules.
1050042	About charge refund rules
1050043	Basic charge refund rules
1050044	<color=#EADE10></color>During the Phantom Thief trial period	 the total amount charged (including through Marthym's Rewards Card	 Premium Pass	 Premium Pass +	 and any direct Gift Pack purchases) will be returned at a rate of {1} {0} = 10 Cognition Crystals. The specific return range and rules are as follows:
<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>400%%</color>.
<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>300%%</color>.
<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>200%%</color>.
<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>150%%</color>.
<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0}</color> or more: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>130%%</color>.
1050045	Refund Example
1050046	Even if {1}{0} were charged in the Phantom Thief Trial	 a total of 92	625 Cognition Crystals will be returned after the release version starts. The return calculations are broken down as follows:
<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0}  returned: (30×10 <color=#EADE10>400%%</color>) = 1200 Cognition Crystals.
<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (170×10 <color=#EADE10>300%%</color>) = 5100 Cognition Crystals.
<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (1800×10 <color=#EADE10>200%%</color>) = 3600 Cognition Crystals.
<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (3000×10<color=#EADE10>150%%</color>) = 4500 Cognition Crystals.
<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} or more returned: (415×10 <color=#EADE10>130%%</color>) = 5395 Cognition Crystals.
Total: 1200 + 5100 + 3600 + 4500 + 5395 = 92	695 Cognition Crystals
1050047	Marthym's Rewards Card Return Rules
1050048	<sprite=0 tint=1>If a Marthym's Rewards Card was purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period	 Cognition Crystals will be returned after the official release according to [Rule 1] based on the amount charged for the Marthym's Rewards Card. Marthym's Rewards Cards will also be returned based on the amount of Marthym's Rewards Cards purchased.
<sprite=0 tint=1>Returns are limited to a maximum of <color=#EADE10>2</color> Marthym's Rewards Cards. If one Marthym's Rewards Card was purchased during the trial period	 one Marthym's Rewards Card will be returned after the official release	 and if two were purchased	 two will be returned. If more than two Marthym's Rewards Card were purchased	 only two will be returned; however	 the amount charged <color=#EADE10>will count</color> toward the Cognition Crystal returns for [Rule 1].
1050049	Refund Example
1050050	If four 30-yuan Marthym's Rewards Cards were purchased during the trial period	 the amount charged will be 120 yuan	 and Cognition Crystals will be returned after the game's release in accordance with [Rule 1]. The player will also receive two Marthym's Rewards Cards. (Cognition  Crystals received through Marthym's Rewards Card won't be counted toward returns for [Rule 1].)
1050051	Phantom Pass Refund Rules
1050052	For Phantom Passes purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period	 Cognition Crystals will be returned after the official release based on the amount charged for Phantom Passes in accordance with [Rule 1]. Based on the charges	 the player will also <color=#EADE10>receive the Phantom Pass items for free</color>.
1050053	Refund Example
1050054	<sprite=0 tint=1>During the trial period	 Player A purchased a {1}{0} Premium Pass. As this {1}{0} <color=#EADE10>will be regarded as the amount charged</color>	 Player A will have Cognition Crystals returned after release in accordance with [Rule 1]	 and receive a free Premium Pass.
<sprite=0 tint=1>During the trial period	 Player B used a {1}{0} Premium Pass and purchased a Premium Pass + for {1}{0}. As the amount charged equals <color=#EADE10>{1}{0}</color>	 Player B will have Cognition Crystals returned after release in accordance with [Rule 1] and <color=#EADE10>receive a free</color> Premium Pass +.

Above are details on the Phantom Thief Trial Return Rules.
