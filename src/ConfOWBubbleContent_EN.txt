1	I'm really not
feeling it right
now...
2	This guy... I should
report him online as
a Menace.
3	I wonder if someone
could cover my
shift...
4	Wonder if there's
anything new on
Divine Justice.
5	That ramen shop in
Shinjuku is getting
a lot of buzz.
6	Error: tnxotb-[6]
7	Error: tnxotb-[7]
8	Error: tnxotb-[8]
9	What are they
doing here?
10	They don't seem to
know anything.
11	Ugh...
12	This sucks	 man...
13	What should I do...
14	Sticking around here
isn't so bad	
really...
15	What was my name	
again?
16	I can't remember
anything... I'm just
trapped here...
17	I hope these days
will never end.
18	This sucks. I just
wanna go home and
hit the sack.
19	Ooh	 something's
going down on
Divine Justice.
20	The café over
there is really
good...
21	The doctor at that
clinic is real
strange...
22	What should I do
for dinner?
23	I really want to
pull a rare figure.
24	Old movies aren't
bad. What's showing
next month?
25	Whoa! Someone broke
the record at the
batting cages?
26	Think I'll visit
the bookstore.
27	Wonder if there's
anything good on
TV tonight.
28	Booored.
38	Ugh! Why does
everything have to
be so annoying?
39	That must've been
really tough!
40	Did you hear that?
41	Shhh	 someone will
hear you!
42	Really? Seriously?
43	What's that?
44	I know!
45	Really?
46	What happened?
47	So tired...
48	Booored.
49	Ugh...
50	*sigh*
51	There's too many...
1110	Did you read it?
The article.
1111	Kiuchi's pitch got
hit by some kid.
No way	 right?
1112	He told that
reporter it was
a real pitch...
1113	Huh? So that was the
best he could do?
1114	If it's true	 that's
pretty abysmal.
1115	Yeah. But you know
what he said after?
1116	I didn't really try
because no women
were watching!
1117	Hahaha! Seriously?
Still	 losing to a
kid? Pathetic!
1118	He always talks so
big	 but he might
really be weak.
1119	He may stand out on
our team	 but he's
not all that.
1120	If he does make it
to majors	 he won't
last long.
1121	We should stop
talking. If someone
overhears us...
1122	Those guys...
Are they joking!?
1123	Talking shit behind
my back!?
1124	How dare they laugh
at me... Screw those
bastards!
1130	Sato-senpai is
definitely our
MVP	 but...
1131	Doesn't he have
any weaknesses?
1132	Oh right...
1133	Apparently	 he once
heard a loud bang
and fainted.
1310	Hiih...
Haah...
1311	I wonder how
Kiuchi-sama's
doing...
1312	Kiuchi-sama...
Where is he	 anyway?
1313	He's the only one
not here yet.
271000	I don't feel like
doing much lately...
271001	I don't want to do
anything. It's all
so boring...
271002	Why do I have to
fill in this
dumb form?
271003	I haven't thought
about the future
at all...
271004	I wouldn't mind
staying home and
doing nothing.
271005	Go into the family
business	 or set off
on my own. Hm...
271006	A lot of students
are skipping school
these days.
271007	I can't focus
at all.
271008	Why do I have to
study so much?
271009	Class is
too hard.
271010	Seems like everyone
goes on Divine
Justice lately.
271011	What is there to
even gain from being
a Menace?
271012	I wonder if I
can still get
yakisoba bread.
271013	That was Noge-san
just now	 right?
Cute as always...
271014	There's a scary guy
on the rooftop...
271015	I'm sleepy. Maybe a
nap will make me
feel better.
271016	Afternoon classes
are such a drag.
271017	I wanna go lie
down somewhere...
271018	This weather's
perfect for a
lunchtime walk.
271019	Arai-san and
Noge-san make quite
a pair	 huh?
271020	Someone was shoved
violently at
the station!
271021	I wonder if Noge-san
is okay...
271022	Who would do
such a thing?
That's terrible.
271023	No updates from
Divine Justice yet.
271024	An accident? I hope
everyone's okay...
271025	Things feel really
dangerous lately.
271030	Damn... I had a
shift today	
didn't I?
271031	Maybe I should buy
some new clothes.
271032	Ah... I'm tired...
271033	The airsoft shop guy
doesn't look like
a civilian...
271034	Looks like a new
movie is coming out.
271035	I hope these days
will never end.
271040	The Subway Slammer
was once a pro
baseball player?
271041	Takeyuki Kiuchi?
Who's that?
271042	Were there really
this many victims?
271043	That bastard Kiuchi.
I hope he rots in
jail for life.
271044	Food reviews these
days are pretty
entertaining.
271045	I hear
Victory Kitchen
is pretty good.
271046	Ah... I'm craving
Chinese food...
271047	All he did was shove
people. How is that
newsworthy?
271048	No news from
Divine Justice...
271050	I saw Noge-san earlier.
I hope she's doing
okay now.
271051	When will Heritage
Kitchen reopen?
271052	Do food critics
really have that
much influence?
271053	Arai-san's been
hanging out with
boys a lot...
271054	The internet's
so boring lately.
271055	I wanna go home
and play games.
271056	I heard
that food critic
apologized.
271057	Do you think those
shops that closed
can reopen?
271058	There haven't been
any good anime
lately...
271059	Heritage Kitchen was
really delicious.
271060	I'm tired. I feel
sleep-deprived
every day.
271061	Hey! What are you
looking at?
271062	Wait...
271063	We can't trust
everything food
influencers say.
271064	Let's go back to
that old shop!
271065	Huh? You have
that figure!?
271066	What the heck is
an "educational
advisor"?
271067	The new teacher
seems pretty good.
271068	I don't really like
that new teacher...
271069	Where should we go
after school today?
271070	I saw a great new
anime. You should
check it out!
271071	The new teacher? Oh	
I was distracted by
Riko-senpai...
271072	Wanna head home
together?
271073	Hey	 wait up!
271074	Do you think the
class rep is	 uh	
single?
271075	The new teacher is
so hot... Should I
talk to him?
2102001	That must've been
really tough!
2102002	Did you hear that?
2102003	Shhh	 someone will
hear you!
2102004	Really? Seriously?
2102005	What's that?
2102006	I know!
2102007	Really?
2102008	What happened?
2102009	So tired...
2102010	Booored.
2102011	Ugh...
2102012	*sigh*
2102013	There's too many...
2102014	Not bad...
2102015	It's too crowded.
I can't shop
like this.
2102016	This store is
so last season.
2102017	Whoa! Who can afford
to spend this much
on clothes?
2102018	That movie was
pretty good.
2102019	Wanna go to karaoke?
2102020	I'm hungry.
Let's go eat.
2102021	My muscles are
killing me. I've
been slacking.
2102022	Is this line just
for the fitting
room?
2102023	The airsoft shop
over there is
real cool.
2102024	A lot of people got
hurt by the Subway
Slammer	 huh?
2102025	He's not here	
is he?
2102026	Ouch... It still hurts
where he hit me...
2102027	I heard he hangs
around the station.
2102028	That's seriously
traumatizing.
2102029	Why hasn't he
been arrested?
2102030	Uh... This tastes
strange. I don't
like it.
2102031	Isn't there a nicer
restaurant nearby?
2102032	I wonder which books
are popular lately.
2102033	That guy's
pretty cute.
2102034	Can you believe what
they sell in vending
machines now?
2102035	Let's go eat crêpes.
2102036	The gym trainer
seems a bit strange.
2102037	I want to stop at
the drugstore on the
way home.
2102038	I heard a student
got injured
recently...
2102039	Someone got pushed
on the tracks! Hope
they're okay...
2102040	When are they going
to catch him?
2102041	I hope that girl
is all right...
2102042	I'm too scared
to go out into
the city now...
2102043	He only attacks
women. It's
terrifying...
2102044	I don't even have an
appetite anymore...
2102045	The underground
mall's got new
clothes in stock!
2102046	Where should I get
a part-time job?
2102047	Oh no! I'm going
to be late for
my shift!
2102048	I'm exhausted.
Think I'll go to the
bathhouse.
2102049	There's always
students studying
at the diner.
2102050	The manager of
the airsoft shop
is scary...
2102051	How long should
we practice today?
2102052	Didn't they see him
on the security
cameras?
2102053	The police should
do something soon.
2102054	I wonder if
Magatsukami knows
who he is.
2102055	I've been so busy
lately	 I haven't
had a break...
2102056	I want to
go on a trip.
2102057	Why aren't you
answering the phone?
2102058	My entire body is
covered in grilled
meat stink.
2102059	I can't relax...
2102060	They finally caught
that guy.
2102061	Why would a baseball
player do something
like that...?
2102062	Yes! They finally
got him!
2102063	Now I don't have to
be so scared to go
out anymore.
2102064	Huh? He turned
himself in?
2102065	He came forward?
He didn't get
caught?
2102066	I wonder how long
his sentence is
gonna be.
2102067	There's a good ramen
shop in Shinjuku.
2102068	Ooh	 a fortune
teller in Shinjuku
you say?
2102069	The ramen at
Victory Kitchen
is really good.
2102070	That gourmet food
critic is popular
these days.
2102071	No new stores are
opening lately...
2102072	That bastard should
have been caught a
long time ago.
2102073	It's nice to be able
to go about the city
without fear.
2102074	I hope he spends the
rest of his life
behind bars.
2102075	This place is
delicious! Why's the
rating so bad?
2102076	Wait	 is that
critic just making
stuff up?
2102077	Take online reviews
with a massive pinch
of salt.
2102078	Let's go eat at
that new shop.
2102079	These reviews are
glowing... Were they
paid off?
2102080	Wow	 it looks really
delicious in
the photo.
2102081	I heard that shop is
collaborating with a
gourmet critic.
2102082	These two review
scores are totally
different...
2102083	Let's go get
something to drink.
2102084	Who would want to go
up against a gourmet
food critic?
2102085	Haha	 that pose!
Is he trying to look
like a samurai?
2102086	A Food Fight	 huh?
Sounds interesting.
2102087	Has it really been
that long since the
incident...?
2102088	This place has
gotten a lot of bad
reviews lately.
2102089	This is delicious!
I've gotta bookmark
this place...
2102180	So it was Miyazawa's
fault that store
shut down!?
2102181	Even if you said
sorry	 we don't have
to forgive you!
2102182	Miyazawa's a Menace?
But his show was
so good...
2102183	Does anyone actually
believe what food
critics say?
2102184	Avoid anywhere
Miyazawa recommends
like the plague.
2102185	Don't listen to what
others say. As long
as you like it...
2102186	I can't believe
people like Miyazawa
actually exist.
2102187	A new restaurant's
opening soon. I
wanna try it.
2102188	The food I cook
myself is the
most delicious.
2102189	I want Chinese
food today.
2102090	I heard there was
an owl here during
the day!
2102091	Finally finished
work...
2102092	I feel exhausted
every day...
2102093	Should we grab a
drink somewhere?
2102094	I'm working every
day and have no
time for myself.
2102095	Guess I'm spending
the night at an
internet café.
2102096	That girl's amazing
at guitar.
2102097	Why doesn't that
girl with the guitar
sell CDs?
2102098	Let's ask Shichi-kun
if he knows any new
shops nearby!
2102099	Almost home! Snacks
and a cold beer are
waiting for me!
2102100	I don't want
to go home...
2102101	I'm so sick of the
same old routine...
2102102	We reached our sales
quota for the month!
Let's celebrate!
2102103	I heard there's
a kid with a pet owl
around here.
2102104	It seems unsafe
around here lately.
2102105	I hope I
get scouted...
2102106	Someone got shoved
here in broad
daylight.
2102107	Would anyone really
slam into people
on purpose?
2102108	I heard the Subway
Slammer's just some
office worker.
2102109	Why would someone
slam into people?
It's so scary.
2102110	Every shop feels
short-staffed now.
2102111	I see a young girl
with a donation box
here sometimes.
2102112	Shichi-kun's working
late every day...
2102113	Why isn't the mascot
a cat?
2102114	Let's hurry home.
It's been dangerous
here lately.
2102115	This is the time we
agreed on. Where
are they?
2102116	It's our first time
meeting. Hmm	 what
are they like?
2102117	That Subway Slammer
actually injured
someone?
2102118	Aren't there any
police officers at
the station?
2102119	I dropped
my wallet...
2102120	I heard the train
stopped. What
happened...?
2102121	The world is getting
more dangerous
every day.
2102122	That girl who was
pushed on the tracks
is in hospital.
2102123	I wonder if they'll
catch the Subway
Slammer soon.
2102124	I think I'll have my
boyfriend come
pick me up.
2102125	I'm too scared
to walk alone.
2102126	I heard he only
targets women.
How disgusting.
2102127	It's not even in the
news	 and there's no
info online...
2102128	If I meet him	 I'll
make sure he
regrets it.
2102129	I'm hungry...
2102130	Let's go to the
underground mall
at the station.
2102131	The underground mall
might have a good
gift for her...
2102132	Let's go buy
some flowers.
2102133	I want a new pair
of sneakers...
2102134	Let's just eat
something.
2102135	I heard the
convenience store
is hiring.
2102136	I got it!
Let's get
sushi today!
2102137	I want dumplings...
2102138	I should clean	 but
I get tired just
thinking of it.
2102139	The new release is
out! I'm staying
up all night!
2102140	Has that girl gotten
even better?
2102141	Why hasn't she
been scouted?
2102142	Does anyone even use
phone booths
these days?
2102143	When will I ever
win first prize?
2102144	I want to pet the
pigeons	 but they
always fly away.
2102145	There's a really
cute chubby cat
in Zoshigaya.
2102146	I wish I
had a cat...
2102147	I haven't seen that
half-Japanese
girl today.
2102148	Man	 school was fun.
Aside from tests and
being broke...
2102149	Come on	 I gotta win
someday... This is
so frustrating!
2102150	I heard he was
caught right here.
2102151	I saw when he was
caught. He was just
a normal guy.
2102152	Didn't the people
who got shoved
report it?
2102153	Let's just go to a
place with
solid reviews
2102154	I can finally
rest at ease.
2102155	I guess the police
can do their job
after all.
2102156	It took them way too
long to catch him.
2102157	Did you hear? The
guy who slammed into
you was caught.
2102158	Did that really
warrant a special
news report?
2102159	What was the name of
Miyazawa's channel
again?
2102160	This place seems to
have good ratings.
Let's eat here.
2102161	How'd they get such
good reviews? The
service stinks.
2102162	Wasn't that gourmet
review show on
today?
2102163	That's fake	 right?
No way it looks like
the photo.
2102164	Nothing beats the
usual go-to!
2102165	There are too many
people making food
review videos.
2102166	A one-year wait for
a reservation?
Unbelievable.
2102167	Every store
has a line.
2102168	Let's just go get
ramen from
Victory Kitchen.
2102169	When will that shop
in Zoshigaya reopen?
2102170	Oh	 Miyazawa just
posted some kind of
announcement.
2102171	I want to eat fine
cuisine from all
over the world.
2102172	Diet first... Then I'm
gonna go all out
at a buffet!
2102173	I want to be
a gourmet critic too.
2102174	Nothing beats a
hearty home-cooked
meal.
2102175	Let's go to
Shinjuku.
2102176	Maybe I'm cursed...
Should I get my
fortune told?
2102177	That fortune teller
Chihaya in Shinjuku
is pretty cute.
2102178	I have zero
appetite... Maybe
it's stress.
2102179	I wonder when I'll
be able to take
a break...
2102190	There's been so many
new shops opening
here lately.
2102191	Online shopping is
so convenient.
2102192	If I had a boyfriend	
he would carry my
bags for me...
2102193	These clothes
are so cute!
2102194	Miyazawa's channel
is gonna bite
the dust now!
2102195	Without Miyazawa's
reviews	 I dunno
what to eat...
2102196	As awful as Miyazawa
was	 food reviews do
come in handy.
2102197	That restaurant was
great! I gotta post
pics online.
2102198	I want to eat
something delicious.
2102199	I've been waiting
for a while now...
Where are you?
5000000	What should I eat?
5000001	I've been to all the
shops around here...
5000002	Chinese food really
is the best
after all.
5000003	I'm gonna sing
until dawn!
5000004	Let's check out
that shop.
5000005	Sorry to keep
you waiting.
5000006	That girl's reading
people's fortunes.
Is she legit?
5000007	A fortune teller?
Hmm...
5000008	Hey	 why are you
still not here...
5000009	Let's go to
the bookstore.
5000010	There's a lot of
food review streams
these days.
5000011	I'll stop at the
convenience store
on my way home.
5000012	It's always crowded
here no matter what
time you come.
5000013	Which shop should
I go to today?
5000014	I'm drinking
tonight!
5000015	Choosing is a
hassle. Let's just
pick any place.
5000016	That Subway Slammer
never came to
Shinjuku	 huh.
5000017	I've never run into
him	 but I'm glad he
was arrested.
5000018	I've only seen stuff
about the Subway
Slammer online.
5000019	There are some real
sickos out there.
5000020	I'm in a
good mood today...
5000021	Oh no! I'm gonna be
late for my date!
5000022	What should
I get her...?
5000023	I won't make it in
time... But taxis are
expensive...
5000024	The Subway Slammer
has become quite
a hot topic.
5000025	Didn't the victims
report it to
the police?
5000026	I don't care
anymore...
5000027	My luck's no good
lately. Maybe I'll
go to a shrine.
5000028	This place has a
low rating. Let's go
somewhere else.
5000029	Takeyuki Kiuchi...
The former baseball
pro	 right?
5000030	Didn't Takeyuki
Kiuchi use to coach
little league?
5000031	I went to one of
those! Can't believe
what he did.
5000032	Why are you
always late?
5000033	I wonder if there's
a perfect place for
a date...
5000034	My heart races every
time I see you.
5000035	A food fight with a
gourmet critic?
Sounds boring.
5000036	Huh? Seriously?
5000037	I found a new shop.
5000038	Hurry up and decide
where we're
going already!
5000039	Wait a minute...
5000040	That's not right.
5000041	Nice. I'm gonna
post this online.
5000042	Why haven't you
been texting me
lately...?
5000043	Make sure to take
a good one!
5000044	That car looks
expensive.
5000045	It's a nice shop	 so
why are the reviews
so bad?
5000046	Ah	 right	 right...
5000047	Since Miyazawa's
apology	 a lot of
critics quit...
5000048	I don't trust food
critics. Not
after Miyazawa.
5000049	They're still talking
about Miyazawa? Who
even cares?
5000050	So Miyazawa screwed
over that little
ramen place?
5000051	Miyazawa ruined
Victory Kitchen's
flavor...?
5000052	I miss that izakaya.
5000053	Honey	 I'm here!
Where are you?
5000054	Today I'll treat
myself to a steak.
5000055	I miss those
garlic-filled
dumplings.
5000056	Ramen... Ramen...
5000057	Ahh... Sooo full...
5000058	Sorry I'm late!
5000059	The shop's too
crowded. Where
should we go?
5000060	Drinks these days
come in all sorts of
weird flavors.
5000061	Let's get a drink
after we eat!
