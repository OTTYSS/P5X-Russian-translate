the register?
3100151	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	It'll probably get hectic	 but try to
keep it cool.
3100153	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	You're the best. Thanks again!
3100154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're in fine fettle today.
3100155	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's retain that momentum.
3100156	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Great job! You were in the zone.
3100158	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	You're already an expert at this.
3100159	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Well	 thanks again for today.
3100160	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Come work another shift when you're
free	 okay?
3100161	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've become a first-rate employee.
3100162	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 do not fall into complacency.
3100170	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Okay	 you're on register again today.
3100171	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	We're having a special sale	 so some items
are discounted.
3100172	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Instant foods	 rain gear	 and hot drinks are
20% off.
3100173	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	All right	 good luck out there.
3100174	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Bravo! What exceptional service.
3100175	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's bustling	 but I have faith in you.
3100176	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Customer	I'm ready to pay.
3100177	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Instant ramen	 a plastic umbrella	 and hot
coffee. These are all on sale.
3100178	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The total is 1	540 yen	 so 20% off
would be...
3100180	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Correct.
3100181	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The register appears to agree.
3100182	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Your math is off. It should be 1	232 yen.
3100183	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	We have a lot of customers	 so please be
extra careful.
3100184	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is no time for japes.
3100185	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	No messing around at work.
3100186	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Honestly	 what's gotten into you?
3100188	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Phew	 the rush is finally over.
3100189	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Thanks for all your help. You really saved
my butt!
3100191	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	More customers means more moola	 right?
3100192	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Anyway	 good job!
3100193	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Today was quite the frenzy.
3100194	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Regardless	 you look proud. Such bedlam
begets equal rewards.
3100201	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nvenience Store Clerk	Hey! First day on the job	 huh?
3100202	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nvenience Store Clerk	You must be {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Mind if I call you {NAME1}-kun?
3100203	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nvenience Store Clerk	I'm Nanami Shibuya	 and I'll be showing you
the ropes.
3100204	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	I'd like to have you work the register today	
but let's start you off by watching me first.
3100205	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Hopefully this'll help you get a feel for it.
3100207	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Of course! Let's hop to it	 then.
3100208	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Great! Let's get started!
3100209	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Oh	 it's worth mentioning we sometimes have
sale days which attract huge crowds
of customers.
3100210	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	It's crazy busy	 but the extra pay will be
worth it.
3100211	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	I hope you consider working those shifts.
3100212	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	So	 ready to dive in?
3100213	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 what impeccable hospitality.
3100214	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This Shibuya girl is a service maven.
3100215	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do try to keep up.
3100216	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Oof	 looks like today's gonna be another
busy day...
3100217	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Sorry to throw you in the deep end.
3100218	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	So	 ready to serve with a smile?
3100220	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Ooh! I'll be counting on you	 then!
3100221	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	No worries. We all start somewhere!
3100222	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	We've got this.
3100223	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	You must be exhausted	 huh?
3100224	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Let's end here for today. Good job!
3100225	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	All right. I've got a few things to take care
of first	 so...
3100226	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Get home safe!
3100227	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A side job at a convenience store...
3100228	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Working a customer service job is certainly
one way to spread kindness	 no?
3100229	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This has been an edifying experience.
3100240	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Thanks for taking another shift!
3100241	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Okay	 you're on register today.
3100242	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Don't worry	 I'll guide you through it.
3100243	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	By the way	 there's a trick to ringing
up items.
3100244	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Like	 you can scan items faster if you know
where the barcode is!
3100245	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Remember that	 and you'll have everything
scanned in no time!
3100246	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Now	 let's see you in action!
3100248	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remember	 she advised us to memorize the
locations of the barcodes.
3100249	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A Tokyo Food Tour magazine.
3100251	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Humans can't seem to get enough
of this Mad Bull canned beverage.
3100253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're in top form.
3100254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Superb! Keep at it.
3100255	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Great job today!
3100256	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	You're already a model employee.
3100257	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Sorry to spring this on you	 but it's time
for a pop quiz!
3100258	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Where is the barcode on the "Tokyo Food
Tour" magazine?
3100260	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Correct!
3100261	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Looks like someone's been paying attention!
3100262	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Nope	 sorry.
3100263	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Pay close attention to where the barcodes are
as you scan each item.
3100264	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Sorry to pull rank on you like that.
3100265	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	But this trick will optimize your workflow	
so keep it in mind.
3100266	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Oh	 your shift is already over. See you
next time!
3100267	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 your efforts have been rewarded.
3100268	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Our minds are now enriched	 as are
our pockets.
3100280	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Today	 I'd like you to help stock items.
3100281	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Simply sort them by label.
3100283	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	That's what I like to hear!
3100284	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems organization is your m√©tier.
3100285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keep up the fine work.
3100286	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Great job today. You're a real lifesaver!
3100288	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	You're one fast learner. I think I've taught
you all I know!
3100289	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	No	 really. That's an honest compliment.
3100290	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Well	 until next time.
3100291	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here's to another productive workday.
3100292	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're looking rather pleased with yourself.
3100300	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Thanks for the help!
3100301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're an old hand at this by now.
3100302	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Great job! No complaints here.
3100304	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Well	 until next time.
3100305	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're looking rather pleased with yourself.
3100320	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The store is packed today.
3100321	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remember	 service with a smile!
3100322	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course the line grows the moment Shibuya
goes on break...
3100323	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 I'm sure you'll manage.
3100324	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Nice work! You dealt with that crowd all
by yourself!
3100325	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	The manager was raving about you in the back.
3100326	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Expect a nice chunk of change!
3100328	Nanami Shi<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>uya	Well done! See you next time.
3100329	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I must say	 I'm impressed by your cordiality
amongst the utter chaos...
3100330	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your altruistic nature most certainly
shone through.
3100450	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Hello. I'm Mebuki Furueda	 the owner.
3100451	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	I thought I'd be able to walk you through
everything today	 but...
3100452	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Truth is	 we're short-staffed and don't have
that kind of time.
3100453	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	So	 think you can learn by example by
watching me instead?
3100454	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Learning through observation alone?
Hoo	 goodness. I fear for this establishment...
3100456	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Yeah	 I like your moxie!
3100457	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Let's get crackin'!
3100458	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	No worries	 you'll be fine!
3100459	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	The job isn't that hard... Well	 usually.
3100460	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No path but forward I suppose.
3100462	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 that apron suits you.
3100463	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The owner seems all right too	 though her
words did rattle me earlier.
3100464	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	She is able to handle her duties efficiently
while keeping an eye on you.
3100465	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They even have a loyal customer base.
I'm glad there are no shady affairs afoot.
3100466	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Great work today. Here	 this is what I
owe you.
3100467	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	You're a fast learner. You'll come work
again	 right?
3100468	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	By the way	 we also hold events sometimes.
3100469	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	The shop is swamped on those days	 so I'd
pay you extra.
3100470	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A tempting proposal. We should return when
they're busy.
3100471	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's more	 aren't flowers a balm for
the heart?
3100480	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Are you the new part-timer?
3100481	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Let's skip the introductions. I need you to
start right away.
3100482	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Any questions?
3100484	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Take customers' orders	 prep them	
serve them	 ring them up	 and then
clean the store.
3100485	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	The meals are all ready-made	 so
it should be simple. Just make sure
you're nice to the customers	 okay?
3100486	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	And that's it. You'll be fine	 kid.
3100487	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Okay	 I need to check the other stores!
3100488	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Better go now	 or I won't make it in time...
3100489	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Well	 I'm counting on you.
3100490	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What nerve. How dare he abruptly leave you
alone to figure things out.
3100491	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 do the best you can. I'm right here
with you.
3100492	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 that customer is ready to pay.
3100493	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And this one appears to want to order.
3100494	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Business is relatively slow today	 so let's
ease into this.
3100495	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Good to see you.
3100496	Region<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>l Manager	Not bad for your first day. It's closing
time	 so you can leave now.
3100497	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Working various jobs has most certainly
helped polish your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
3100498	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Although far from glamorous	 this isn't a bad
place to work.
3100499	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It might be wise to work another shift if
the opportunity arises.
3100510	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Oh	 you decided to come!
3100511	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	I was all over the map the other day	 so I
thought I might've put you off...
3100512	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	You did amazing last time	 so today I'd like
you to pick out flowers.
3100513	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Don't worry	 I'm going to show you how
it's done.
3100514	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ahh... real floral responsibilities at last.
3100515	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Sorry to put you on the spot	 but here's a
flower question for you.
3100516	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	If a customer asks for bold flowers that
convey love	 what would you pick out
for them?
3100518	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Correct!
3100519	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Red roses are the embodiment of love
and boldness.
3100520	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Aaand... Bzzt	 wrong!
3100521	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	That wouldn't completely satisfy the
customer's request.
3100522	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	They asked for something to express both
love and boldness.
3100523	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	The lily of the valley can convey love	 but
is too demure.
3100524	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	And although big and bold	 dahlias signify
congratulations and gratitude.
3100525	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Roses are dazzling	 and red ones symbolize
a confession or affectionate gesture.
3100526	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	That's why they're an ideal way to
express love.
3100527	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	I think that's enough on flower language
for now.
3100528	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	I'm sure this knowledge will come in handy
when a customer comes asking for help!
3100529	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	If there's anything you're uncertain about	
you can always reach out to me.
3100530	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	So	 ready for a final review? An order just
came in.
3100531	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	They want something modest to convey their
love. What flower do you suggest?
3100532	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 a small flower might fit the bill
quite nicely.
3100533	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps something the manager told us
before may provide a clue. Do you
have any suggestions?
3100535	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Based on what she mentioned earlier	 I'm not
convinced that is the right choice.
3100536	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A smaller flower size seems to be the most
appropriate for the customer's requirements.
3100537	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 I'd say this one seems to fit
the criteria.
3100538	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hopefully the customer will like them too.
3100539	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Hmm. I'm not sure roses are the best choice
in this case.
3100540	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	No worries. I'll pick one out	 so
watch closely.
3100541	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	The customer was thrilled!
3100542	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	You're really getting the hang of this.
I think you're ready to take more on.
3100543	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	At any rate	 here's your pay.
3100544	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Make sure to keep up with your
flower studies.
3100545	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	I admit I've got a lot to learn too.
3100546	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	If you have any questions	 just say the word!
3100547	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Knowledge is indeed an endless pursuit.
3100548	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Well	 good work today!
3100549	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Come back anytime.
3100550	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems the owner still has work to do.
3100551	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 it's time we head home.
3100560	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Hi there! Thanks for helping out! I've got my
hands full right now.
3100561	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	Today	 I'd like you to focus on sales.
3100562	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	I'll handle the custom orders!
3100563	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why	 you're already a service expert.

coming up...
3100693	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	We'll never finish all these orders unless
we team up.
3100694	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	First up is a bouquet with big	 bright blooms
to congratulate a friend on the birth of
their baby.
3100695	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right	 time to pick some flowers. Big	 bold
ones to celebrate new life.

vibrant and highly fragrant.
3100716	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That flower lacks a strong aroma.
Let's choose another.
3100717	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Surely that one's too pale? They asked for
something vivid. Let's choose something else.
3100718	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 this flower's fragrance and bright
yellow hue are perfect.
3100719	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>buki Furueda	The customer was delighted with the bouquet!

customers today	 okay?
3101201	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You probably heard	 but lately our Gourmet
Special Strawberry Cr√™pe has been trending
on social media...
3101202	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This next customer is staring at
their phone too. They must be checking
those trends as well.
3101205	Customer	Whoa! That's the one! I've been wanting
to try that ever since I saw it online!
3101207	Customer	Oh	 I don't think that's it... I wanted the
one I saw online	 with strawberries in it.
3101209	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work!
3101210	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's what you earned today.

3101224	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	One choco banana	 please!
3101225	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph. According to the procedure	 you just
put in the filling and wrap it up. Take it
easy and you should have no problem.
3101227	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The banana goes in first. Then	 the only
ingredient left is...
3101229	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't think that's it. Let's think again.
It's a choco banana cr√™pe...
3101230	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Alright	 looks like you're finished.
3101231	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thanks again for your help today!

job well done.
3101235	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's clean up and return home.
3102001	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Ahh	 so you must be our new part-time
employee	 huh?
3102002	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I'm always happy to see one of Shun's
friends come by.
3102004	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Hahaha	 you seem like a hard worker! I'm
sure I can count on you for all sorts
of things.
3102005	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	We'll just get you acquainted with the shop
today. I'll give ya some pointers here
and there.
3102006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yamagoshi seems to be right back to his
old self.
3102007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. So you'll be starting with dishwashing
duty today.
3102008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a good place to start.
3102009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take care not to break any of the bowls.
3102010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've finished washing all those dishes...
This truly is a popular place.
3102011	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Would ya look at that! You finished washing
all those bowls. I knew I could count on you.
3102012	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Thanks to you	 I can focus all my attention
on crafting my ramen.
3102013	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Right. Here's what you earned today.
3102014	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	By the way	 if you happen to see Shun	 tell
him to stop by and see me	 all right?
3102015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My customers are coming back and business
is booming. But I think we're still short
on hands.
3102016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps your valiant dishwashing efforts
will be of aid to Yamagoshi	 hm?
3102017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you've got some time later	 why not come
back and help out some more?
3102101	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Oh	 you're back! Good to see ya!
3102103	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You've certainly got the spirit. I won't
make you wash dishes today	 though.
Got something else you can help with.
3102104	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Shun told me you're quite the talented chef.
3102105	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I've been working on a curry for our secret
menu. I was hoping you could help with that.
3102106	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	It's a simple recipe I used to make for the
kitchen staff	 so I'll teach you how to
make it real quick.
3102107	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You'll want to heat up the spices in the pot
first	 'til you can smell 'em. Then add the
meat	 potatoes	 and carrots in order.
3102108	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Add some water	 simmer it for 20 minutes	
then finish it off with a splash of
coconut milk.
3102109	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Did you get all that?
3102111	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Alright then	 let's get to it.
3102112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If everything's ready	 let's start making
the curry.
3102113	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You remember the steps Yamagoshi told you	
right? The first thing is...
3102115	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't believe he said to simmer it
right away.
3102116	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll add the ingredients next. The order
to put them in was...
3102118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you certain that's what he told you?
3102119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 that's correct.
3102120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a marvelous fragrance...
3102121	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well then	 the finishing touch is a splash
of coconut milk. Do you remember when to
put it in?
3102123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Doesn't that seem too early?
3102124	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's too long to let it simmer...
3102125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm	 that timing sounds just right.
3102126	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's finished.
3102127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's have Yamagoshi do a taste test.
3102128	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Oh	 not bad. You really do know your way
around a kitchen. This is perfectly seasoned.
3102129	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Well	 here's what I owe you for today.
3102130	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Feel free to come back and help whenever
you want.
3102131	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That was a challenging task	 but you passed
with flying colors.
3102132	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That bold use of seasoning seems to have
paid off.
3102201	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Ah	 you came just at the right time!
3102202	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	One of the other part-timers called out
sick	 and we're swamped with orders.
3102203	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Take care of the dining area	 would you?
3102204	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Just tell me the orders here	 and we'll
be all good!
3102205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It really is crowded.
3102206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Better get moving and take some orders.
3102207	Customer	Ramen and gyoza	 please!
3102208	Customer	Another ramen for me	 too!
3102209	Customer	One order of gyoza over here.
3102210	Customer	I'll take an order of gyoza as well.
3102211	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like that's all the customers' orders
for the time being.
3102212	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you remember all of that?
3102213	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Hey	 can you tell me what they ordered?
3102215	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Eh? You sure about that?
3102216	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Good work. I'll handle it from here.
3102217	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Once I've made 'em	 you can take 'em to
the customers.
3102218	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like that's the end of it.
3102219	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm glad to see you took all those orders
without incident.
3102220	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Alright	 the orders are ready	 so let's
serve them.
3102221	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Ah	 thank you! You've been a great help.
3102222	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Here's what you made today. And I slipped a
little extra in there for your trouble.

Come back anytime.
3102224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It was a busy day	 but I'd say it was
a fulfilling one.
3102225	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Judging from your expression	 I'm guessing
you agree.
3102226	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 now	 let's go home and get some rest	
shall we?
3102301	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Thanks for coming.
3102302	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Looks like you're getting the hang of
working here	 aren't you?
3102303	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Thanks for your help	 as always.
3102304	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... The shop's bustling again today.
3102305	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll have no shortage of tasks today.
3102306	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Taking orders	 washing dishes	 or perhaps
making curry...
3102307	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well then	 let's see how we can help out
Yamagoshi today.
3102308	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've become a fine hand at this.
3102309	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No matter what the task	 you handle it
with ease.
3102310	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've had sufficient practice	 so this all
must be a breeze for you.
3102311	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time to head home and rest.
3102400	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Thanks for coming in again today.
3102402	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's good to see that business continues

3102421	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	It's not too busy today	 so I'd like it if
you could help make some curry.
3102423	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Here's what you earned. Thanks again.
3102424	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Yep	 looks like I can leave all the
curry-making to you. You've come
a long way	 haven't you?
3102425	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You look quite pleased with yourself today.
3102440	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Am I glad to see you! We could really use
your help right now.
3102441	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	We're packed with customers today	 so it's
a bit hectic...
3102442	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I'll focus on the kitchen	 so I'll leave
all the customer orders to you.
3102444	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Ah	 thank you! You've been a great help.
3102445	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Here's what you made today. And I slipped a

knock those out first.
3102463	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	Thanks	 man!
3102464	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	Let's eat in the kitchen then head home.
3102465	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	Later.
3102480	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	We're in the kitchen today. Uhh	 I'll leave
that section to you.
3102482	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Never would I have imagined Shun bringing
his friends here... let alone as an extra
pair of hands.
3102483	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Here	 this is today's pay.
3102484	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Oh	 and feel free to use my kitchen. Eat
something before you leave.
3102485	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	You're lookin' hale and hearty	 Pops.
Sometimes I stop by 'cause I'm worried.
3102486	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	Wait here	 I'll make us something. You're
hungry	 right?
3102487	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	See ya.

back 'em up!

3102494	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	You saved us today. We would've been
overwhelmed with our usual numbers.
3102495	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	Let's take a breather then head home.
3104001	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Back for more	 huh?
3104002	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You and Tomoko-chan really helped us out
the other day.

counting on you again today.
3104004	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Since you're here by yourself this time...
Could I get you to hop on register?
3104006	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You really are dependable! Well	 then	
you know what to do.
3104007	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Oh	 and remember you can't pick out the
medicine for the customer. You're not a
pharmacist	 after all.
3104008	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Do your best to memorize the shelf locations.
Then you'll be able to help
customers find what they need.
3104009	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	For example	 the adhesive bandages are on
this shelf next to the register.
3104010	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	And cough drops are on shelf 3 near
the checkout	 as well.
3104011	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	The manual lists the locations for
everything we sell	 so give it a read if you
have some time.
3104013	Ho<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rse-Voiced Customer	Excuse me	 do you have any cough drops?
3104014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm fairly certain the manager told us
where cough drops are. Do you recall?
3104016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh? I didn't see any there...
3104017	Ho<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rse-Voiced Customer	Oh	 thanks! I'll go take a look.
3104018	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Good work! That's it for today.
3104019	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	And here. This is your pay.
3104020	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	If you've got the time	 I hope you'll
come again!
3104021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not a bad job	 I'd say.
3104022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's much to be learned from customer
service jobs. Perhaps you should continue in
the future?
3104030	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thanks for coming! We could use the help.
3104031	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	We're very busy today... Sorry for throwing
you into this	 but could you start
right away?
3104032	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You'll earn some bonus pay!
3104033	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Ah	 that's right. I was hoping you could
read the manual and learn the locations of
all the shelves.
3104034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 try to commit all the details to
memory. Particularly the items most frequently
requested by customers.
3104037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears the first wave of customers is
approaching. Let's concentrate on our work.
3104038	Customer	Urgh... I can't stand all this overtime...
Do you sell any energy drinks?
3104040	Customer	I just checked over there	 but it looked
like it was just daily necessities...
3104041	Customer	Huh? Maybe I missed something...
3104042	Customer	I'll go take another look...
3104043	Customer	Thanks! I found them.
3104044	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If he's feeling that enervated	 shouldn't he
simply rest? I fail to understand...
3104045	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer Holding Stomach	Oof	 my stomach... I ate way too much...
Where's the antacids?
3104047	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't believe that's right.
3104048	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer Holding Stomach	Thank you so	 so much. Urgh	 I really hope
this does something...
3104049	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looking good. Try to maintain this pace.
3104050	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Good work! You're free to go now.

3104052	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's your pay for today. And as promised	
you earned a bonus rate.
3104053	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thanks again! And be careful getting home!
3104054	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Even in such chaotic conditions	 you were
able to provide excellent service.
3104055	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You must have felt such compassion for the
needs of others today.
3104061	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The shift went by without incident.
3104062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A commendable job.
3104063	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work today!
3104064	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's your pay.
3104065	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thanks for your hard work!
3104066	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Working with others is truly enlightening.
It would be worthwhile to come back.
3104070	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	So glad you could make it! It's another busy
one today.

issue. You've become quite adept here	 too.
3104076	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Working with others is truly enlightening.
It would behoove us to come back	
wouldn't you agree?

3104081	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The customers have been streaming in for a
while. It's pretty busy	 but we can do it!
3104083	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Nice work! It got pretty crazy there...
3104084	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But thanks to you	 we made it through.

3105004	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	Scuse me. I don't remember the title but I'm
looking for an adventure novel set in space.
3105006	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	Yes	 that's the one! "Through the Cosmos!" The
hero gallops through space on a horse!
3105007	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	It's like you read my mind! Thanks!
3105008	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	This looks like a generic sci-fi novel...
3105009	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	I'll find it myself. Thanks anyway.
3105010	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	This looks like a magical girl manga...
3105011	Cust<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mer Wearing Glasses	I'll find it myself. Thanks anyway.
3105012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! You know your books. I suppose I
shouldn't be surprised.
3105013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The customers won't be pleased if you make
wild guesses.

give them their gift.

3105068	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They bought a how-to book	 so they should get
a metal charm.
3105069	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	H-hoo!? Get your hands off me! I'm not a
special giveaway!

busy	 but we'll make it work!
3105204	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Nice work! It really was crazy	 huh?
3105205	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm not sure I could've managed if you
hadn't been there!
3105206	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Good with customers and well-read to boot!
You've been a great help today.
3105207	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway	 see you next time!
3106001	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	So you're the new part-timer	 huh?
Thank goodness.
3106002	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Our shop's been crazy busy. I'm thankful	
of course	 but that means it gets
crazy hectic!
3106003	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	The job's pretty straightforward. There's
just not a lot of downtime!
3106004	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	It might be a bit rough at first	 but the
busier it is	 the more money you'll make!
3106005	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Good luck!
3106007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It really is a popular shop.

to have no end...
3106008	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work! You some kind of robot? No one's
ever been that good on their first day.
3106009	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Lemme guess	 are you too a die-hard
croquette fan? Either way	 you were a
huge help!
3106010	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's your pay. Come back soon	 'kay?
3106011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's only been one day	 but you seem to have
gained a wealth of knowledge on croquettes.
3106012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely	 but
perhaps we should change clothes
before heading home?
3106050	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You came back! Glad to have you.
3106051	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I'll leave all the customers to you. You're
just that capable!
3106053	Customer	Let's see... I'll take one potato croquette
and one roast pork!
3106056	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 that's right. Well calculated.
3106057	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 that's too much! Try again...!
3106059	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work as always! Here's your pay.
3106060	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You really are a natural! What did we ever
do without you?
3106061	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Stop by any time.
3106062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You had to calculate every bill	 so your
mental math must be in tip-top shape!
3106063	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely	 but
perhaps we should change before heading home?
3106100	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thanks for coming in! We're super
short-staffed today!
3106101	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	It's always busy	 but today's especially
crazy. You'll get a pay boost	 of course	 so
can I count on you?
3106102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a preposterously long line...!
3106103	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In times like this	 staying level headed is
crucial. Don't panic and all will be well.
3106105	Customer	Five beef croquettes	 please.
3106108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Exactly! Bravo.
3106109	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've doubled the amount	 try again!
3106110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's far too cheap! I understand it's busy	
but this is no time for games.
3106111	Customer	Lately	 our kid is obsessed with pork belly
skewers! We'll take six.
3106114	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 that's far too low! Try again.
3106115	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Exactly! Bravo.
3106116	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey! This is a business	 not a charity!

3106118	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's your pay! I added a little extra for
the hard work you put in!

always welcome here!
3106120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It was busier than ever but you calculated
with ease. You truly continue to impress.
3106121	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely	 but
perhaps we should change before heading home?
3106150	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Today you're on stocking duty! Once they're
ready	 put them out for the customers	 ‚Äòkay?
3106151	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I'm counting on you!
3106153	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The scent of meat in the air is divine...
The fact that you can focus at all
is commendable.
3106154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey! The meatballs are about to sell out.
Go grab some more from the back.
3106155	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work today! Thanks to you	 we didn't
run out of a single thing!
3106156	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's your pay for the day! Come back
anytime. We're always happy to have you!
3106157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You quickly picked up the job through mere
observation. A remarkable feat	 indeed.
3106200	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thanks for coming in! When it's busy	 things
just don't run the same without you.
3106201	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I'll leave the customers to you!
3106203	Customer	I'll take a bite-sized pork cutlet and some
meatballs	 please!
3106204	Customer	Can I have five fried potato mochi	 please?
3106205	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work today! You really came in clutch!
3106206	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Here's your pay! I added a little extra for
the hard work you put in!
3106207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It was busier than ever but you calculated
with ease. You truly continue to impress.
3106208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your clothes smell veritably deep-fried!
Go change and let's go home.
3106250	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I'm counting on you today! I'm sure you
won't disappoint.
3106252	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work today! You really came in clutch!

3106254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You handled the customers well. I expected
no less from you.
3300003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's packed today. This certainly isn't the
ideal environment for studying.
3300004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's noisy and customers are constantly
entering and leaving. This may not be the
best place to focus.
3300006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo! To think you were able to
concentrate amidst all this distraction.
3300007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems your efforts paid off despite the
hustle and bustle.
3300023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... You could hear a feather drop. Why	
it's the perfect environment for studying!
3300025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems you were able to concentrate
rather well.
3300027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's about to get quite crowded in here.
Shall we get going?
3300040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. It's quiet and peaceful here.
3300041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This seems to be an optimal studying
environment.
3300043	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Complete quiet isn't for everyone. Studying
around others seems to suit you.
3300044	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You seem to have made good progress. We'll
have to come back again sometime.
3300061	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like you're having trouble focusing.
3300062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we call it a day?
3300064	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not a very efficient study session	 I'm
afraid. You did manage to make some
progress	 though.
3300065	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Now looks to be a good stopping
point. Shall we head out?
3300081	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The rain outside is creating a peaceful
atmosphere. Quite ideal for a study session	
is it not?
3300084	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The perfect environment truly gives rise
to success!
3300085	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can tell you progressed by leaps and bounds!
3300086	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Now looks to be a good stopping
point. Shall we head out?
3300102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not as busy as usual	 perhaps due to
the rain.
3300104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo my	 you are truly in the zone. I'll
leave you to it.
3300105	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that's a look of satisfaction. Your
concentration was truly a sight to behold.
3300106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is worth coming back	 hoom? Well	 shall we
head home?
3300111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your pen hasn't moved for quite
some time.
3300112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is concentration eluding you?
3300113	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 you don't seem to be making
much progress.
3300114	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We all have those days	 I suppose.
How about we pack up and get going?
3300125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo! Your pen hasn't stopped moving!
Your rapid progress is nothing short
of incredible.
3300126	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo! You made it this far already?
3300127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems you are truly in the zone today.
3300128	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not good to push yourself too hard	
though. Why don't we call it a day here?
3300150	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Have you finished warming up?
3300151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't hold back!
3300152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Harder! Faster! Show me what you can do!
3300153	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done.
3300154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems your brutal training has honed
both your mind and body.
3300156	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 you look thoroughly spent.
3300157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How about cooling down and heading out?
3300160	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What an elegant facade. Is this a bathhouse?
3300161	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is certainly quite different from the bath
at home	 hoom?
3300162	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... There are even days with medicinal
baths. They're sure to have many effects.
3300165	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! You look mightily refreshed.
3300166	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In fact	 you're practically glowing!
3300167	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is nothing wrong with a bath at home	
but bathhouses have an appeal all their own.
3300168	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you wish to become more charming	 it may
benefit you to visit regularly.
3300176	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! You look mightily refreshed.
3300177	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In fact	 you're practically glowing!
3300178	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that you're rejuvenated	 shall we
return home?
3300188	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 haven't you been in there a little
too long?
3300189	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Any longer and the wonderful effects from the
bath will go to waste.
3300190	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You certainly seem to be feeling its
medicinal benefits	 though...
3300191	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that you're rejuvenated	 shall we
return home?
3300200	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Physical training	 you say? A fine idea.
3300201	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They appear to have even more obscure
equipment here.
3300202	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 what on earth? Is that... a wooden
training dummy?
3300203	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears that using this dummy as a
sparring partner would allow you attain
a full-body workout.
3300204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... There don't seem to be many other
people using it.
3300205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It will take a bit of <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to try it out.
3300206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Meaning you're certain to train your spirit
as well as your body here!
3300207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're holding back! Remember	 the dummy is
your enemy!
3300208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes! That's more like it!
3300209	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fight like you mean it! That's it! Keep it
coming!
3300210	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems your brutal training has honed
both your mind and body.
3300211	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 you look thoroughly spent. How about
cooling down and heading out?
3300220	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The trainers gave you a special sports drink.
3300221	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Drinking it should improve the results of
your workout.
3300222	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	May as well drink it before your workout.
3300223	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent form! Keep it up!
3300224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a magnificently productive session!
3300225	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo. I can tell from your face that
you agree.
3300226	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 you look thoroughly spent.
3300227	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How about cooling down and heading out?
3300240	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You keep things in good order as it is.
A little more cleaning should hardly prove difficult.
3300241	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The effort you put into tidying your room
is proof enough.
3300242	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By cleaning up even more thoroughly	 your
consideration will surely flourish.
3300243	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very well. Once you've finished preparing	
you can get to cleaning.
3300244	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Were the corners truly this dusty?
Well spotted.
3300245	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done. A clean room fosters peace of
mind.
3300246	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By cleaning every nook and cranny	 your
conscientiousness will reach new heights.
3300247	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 all that remains is putting away the
cleaning supplies.
3300260	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's clean every inch of this room until
it's spotless.
3300261	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keep in mind that proper cleaning requires
careful consideration.
3300262	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! Not a single speck of dust!
3300263	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By cleaning every nook and cranny	 your
conscientiousness will reach new heights.
3300264	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 all that remains is putting away the
cleaning supplies.
3300270	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You already keep it very neat...
3300271	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 there shouldn't be any egregious messes.
Instead	 clean where you don't normally look.
3300272	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'd be surprised by how much dust gathers.
3300273	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? Why is there dirt here of all places?
3300274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd say that about does it for today. It
feels good as new	 doesn't it?
3300275	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By cleaning every nook and cranny	 your
conscientiousness will reach new heights.
3300276	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 all that remains is putting away the
cleaning supplies.
3300280	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A video game?
3300281	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From my understanding	 games allow you to
enjoy experiences otherwise unavailable to you	 yes?
3300282	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In other words	 one could say they bring
your fantasies to life.
3300283	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For example	 in this game you become the
hero and defeat the demon king.
3300284	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To be someone special and gain acclaim.
That's the desire being fulfilled here	 yes?
3300285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've heard there is a great deal of
variety	 too.
3300286	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I ask that you play all manner of games so
that I might learn more about human desires.
3300287	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which means you'll first need to beat
this one!
3300288	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	After all	 our own adventure has only just
begun!
3300290	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Will we play as a different protagonist
going forward?
3300291	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... Seeing the story from a different
perspective provides us with more nuance.
3300292	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though at times like these	 it helps to review
what's already happened.
3300293	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Time seems to have flown by.
3300294	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We shall have to pick up where we left off
at a later date.
3300295	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You see	 even I have heard the phrase "when
it comes to games	 don't play more than an hour a day."
3300296	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that commanding a wide range of
characters has also increased your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
3300297	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which character will you choose next time?
I'll let you think on it.
3300298	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we call it a day?
3300310	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah yes	 the story continues.
3300311	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... We want to progress the story	 but
this boss is quite challenging.
3300312	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps the difficulty level is too high?
3300313	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We somehow managed to beat the boss.
3300314	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Overcoming the enemy's strength may have
been a crucial step in our journey.
3300315	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... By utilizing a wide range of
skills	 your personal <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>is
even stronger.
3300316	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That was quite the difficult session. Let's
stop there for today.
3300321	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems you can play a previously completed
stage at a higher difficulty...
3300322	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very well. Let's give it our all.
3300323	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... So the route you take is key. If you
don't progress efficiently	 your enemies
will outmatch you.
3300324	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wha‚Äî! The boss is truly formidable!
3300325	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Be sure to use your skills wisely!
3300326	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That was a close one...
3300327	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But our victory was the natural result of
utilizing strategy.
3300328	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By continuing to efficiently defeat enemies	
you'll be able to adapt to anything.
3300329	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears that your refined approach has
further honed your <sprite=4><color=#ffb400>Proficiency</color>.
3300330	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You must be mentally drained. I believe
that's enough for today.
3300340	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. How about hopping on the
treadmill today?
3300341	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It may be a tad tiresome running in place
with unchanging scenery...
3300342	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But it does allow you to run come rain or shine.
3300343	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 you're going too fast. Pace yourself.
3300344	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Did I not say you would overwork yourself?
3300345	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Pushing yourself that hard takes some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>
	 I'll give you that.
3300346	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You must be exhausted. Perhaps it is time to
head home and rest?
3300360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another day on the treadmill?
3300361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take care not to trip.
3300362	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Could you try running for me again?
3300363	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your courage allows you to challenge yourself
and push past your limits. Thank you for
allowing me to see it.
3300364	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You look positively beat. Why not head home
after a brief respite?
3300370	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo	 taking on the bench press today?
3300371	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In addition to upper body strength	 it's
important to regulate your pace	 which takes
practice.
3300372	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we begin?
3300373	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 isn't it a bit unreasonable to start
with that amount of weight?
3300374	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I suspected...
3300375	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though I commend your courage to take on
such a challenge.
3300376	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You look positively beat. Why not head home
after a brief respite?
3300380	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're certainly brimming with energy and
stamina today.
3300381	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I imagine heavier weights will prove no
match for you today.
3300382	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo	 excellent form!
3300383	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You really had the tenacity to overcome your
limits. Incredible.
3300384	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You look positively beat. Why not head home
after a brief respite?
3300400	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 an action game today?
3300401	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why don't you show me your aim?
3300402	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your technique could use some refinement.
3300403	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Intense focus takes its toll. Why not call
it a day?
3300404	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A modicum of rest will benefit your future
progress.
3300405	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In dealing with the oncoming threat	 I can
tell your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color> has been further honed.
3300406	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us continue another time.
3300420	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 a more toothsome level to try...
3300421	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This fight looks to be quite the challenge	
but far be it from me to try and stop you.
3300422	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 show me what you're capable of.
3300423	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! What ferocious offense! How will you
turn the tides?
3300424	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A splendid display of combat!
3300425	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The boss is stunned! Seize your chance!
3300426	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 looks like you handled that well.
3300427	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a spectacular outcome. I believe it's
fair to say you rank among the top in this
game.
3300428	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Greater accomplishments await you. Let us
continue another time.
3300440	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Playing games outside is quite refreshing.
3300441	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you ready? Then let's begin.
3300442	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Spot the target and wait for a clear shot...
Perhaps this can double as firearms training.
3300443	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Pay close attention. Enemies will appear at
the edges of the screen.
3300444	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... It appears that we lost.
3300445	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think you did quite well	 considering this
game was unfamiliar to you.
3300446	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us try again some other time.
3300460	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 you seem to be doing well today.
3300461	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I look forward to seeing your score climb.
3300462	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're predicting the next attack based on
their movements! What discerning judgment!
3300463	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perfect! You defeated the boss with
such ease!
3300464	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With such focus	 you'll make it to the final
level in no time!
3300465	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems you've beaten your old high score.
3300466	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a fulfilling use of our time.
3300467	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 time flies. Let us leave for now and try
again some other time.
3300480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tending to the plants in the garden?
3300481	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Be careful as you handle them. They can be
quite delicate.
3300482	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... I can tell you care for these plants
by your tender administrations.
3300483	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see you've finished tending to the plants.
3300484	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps this affection you show them
means your <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> has increased?
3300485	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think that's enough for today.
3300500	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Today	 the whole garden needs your attention.
3300501	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seem to be cracks in that pot.
3300502	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Be sure to take good care of your tools	
as well as your plants.
3300503	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo! It's so beautiful now I barely
recognize it!
3300504	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Putting all that work into the garden
surely teaches you greater <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>.
3300505	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All that careful work must have been tiring.
I think that's enough for today.
3300520	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The cats are gathering...
3300521	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not very good with cats... Perhaps	 you
should be the one to play with them.
3300522	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Spending time with animals has
deepened my <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
3300523	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 the they seem to have departed.
3300524	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. Interacting with those animals seems
to have had a positive effect on you.
3300525	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's with that look? I'm not some kind of
animal like they are!
3300543	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 aren't you forgetting something?
3300544	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 milk! I've heard there is nothing like
a cold bottle of milk after a hot bath.
3300545	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 drink up.
3300546	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo! You downed it in one gulp!
3300547	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that you're rejuvenated	 shall we
return home?
3300801	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Male Student	I told you	 it's impossible! You can't eat
that much!
3300802	Stuf<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>ed Male Student	*belch* I'm no quitter! This time was a 
bust	 but next time...
3300803	Stuf<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>ed Male Student	I'll finish every last drop of the
Universe-Sized Ramen!
3300804	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Male Student	Big words	 pal. In that case	 call me next
time you challenge Victory Kitchen!
3300805	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Victory Kitchen... That's the ramen shop in
Shinjuku. Let's visit when we have
the chance.
3300814	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A contest for gorging on as much food as
possible... Sounds like a fine event awash
with desire.
3300815	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There appear to be three ramen sizes:
Large	 Extra Large and Universe-sized.
3300816	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Universe-sized...? I shudder to think.
Why not step up to the challenge?
3300821	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Welcome! Oh	 it's you! Care to try our
Eating Challenge?
3300822	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	It's our shop's latest idea. The first stage
is the Large-sized Challenge.
3300823	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	One large	 then! Comin' right up!
3300831	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	L-Look at those noodles! This is the size of a
small mountain!
3300832	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Surprised? Don't worry	 we didn't compromise
on flavor!
3300833	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Most customers can't handle the large	
so don't let your guard down.
3300834	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Finish it	 and you'll earn a fabulous cash prize!
3300835	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You can't lose now... Think of the prize!
Good luck	 {NAME2}!
3300836	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Okay	 you have 30 minutes to complete the
Large-sized Challenge!
3300837	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Ready	 set... Eat!
3300843	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't panic! Use your chopsticks to lift and
eat the noodles as they cool!
3300851	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 what a pity... Still	 you did as best
you could.
3300852	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll need more training to best this ramen.
3300854	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Regardless	 you put in a valiant effort
against that enormous ramen bowl.
3300861	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wh-What!? Incredible! You actually finished
that huge bowl of ramen!
3300862	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Congratulations! You beat the Large-sized
Challenge!
3300863	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	For this achievement...
3300864	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	...your fabulous prize is 3	500 yen!
Impressive work!
3300865	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Now that you've conquered the Large-sized
Challenge	 you can proceed to the next stage.
3300866	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Let us know when you're ready to take
on the Extra Large-sized Challenge.
We'll be waiting!
3300867	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You were superb	 {NAME2}!
3300868	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I was especially shocked by how you deftly
used your chopsticks to cool the noodles!
3300869	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The way you scooped every last noodle from the
broth was masterful as well.
3300870	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The stomach played a part no doubt	 but your

3300902	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	The next stage is the Extra Large-sized
Challenge! Think you've got what it takes?
3300903	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Extra large	 hoom...? In other words	 it must

Don't tell me the sheer quantity has you

too great...
3301032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll need to train more if you wish to best this
ramen.
3301034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 I respect the courage you displayed in

3301116	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm honored to witness such a daring feat.
Now	 let's be on our way.
3302003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's surely some benefit to such vocal
expression.

improvement.
3302033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your singing has improved. Practice truly

3302244	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What wonderful singing! Your voice carried
such raw emotion.
3302274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a perfect song! I only wish my wings

3303001	P<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>iest	You're welcome to stay for as long as
you'd like.
3303002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm astounded there is such a quiet retreat
near the shopping district.
3303003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's an ideal moment to relax.
3303004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is something on your mind? You've been silent
for a while now.
3303008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh? Whatever is the matter?
3303010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears you've hit upon something.
3303031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a scenic hideaway in the city.
3303034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would seem you've recalled something.
3303036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a tranquil retreat. We should visit
again to rejuvenate.
3303061	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... It's nice to rest like this every once
in a while.
3303065	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What is it? You look as if you've recalled
something.
3303067	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You seem eager to confirm something. Very
well	 let's be on our way.
3303091	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a pleasant breeze.
3303095	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears lightning has struck.
3303097	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've had an insightful day I see.
Well then	 shall we head home?
3303121	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I	 too	 feel at peace here.
3303125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would seem you've had an epiphany.
3303128	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Appears you've gained something of import.
Shall we return home?
3303151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... That cloud looks like braised pork...
3303155	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would seem you've gathered your thoughts.
3303157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems you gained some new understanding	
whilst I gained a craving for braised pork.
3303181	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's particularly quiet today.
3303185	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo!? What is it? You suddenly grew pale.
3303188	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... For some reason	 you're aglow with a
sense of triumph.
3303189	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks as if you've conquered a fear.
Well	 shall we call it a day?
3303211	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This place is always so pleasant
and meticulously maintained.
3303215	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What is it? From your expression	 it appears
inspiration has struck.
3303218	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 shall we head back?
3303241	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your home is comfortable	 but I find this
place equally soothing.
3303245	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You look rather inspired.
3303248	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can tell you've gained something of import.
3303249	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 shall we be on our way?
3303271	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Many birds flock here	 but the mere sight of
me frightens them away...
3303275	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What is it? Has something occurred to you?
3303277	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You appear preoccupied.
3303301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your home is comfortable	 but I find this
place equally soothing.
3303305	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You seem to have remembered something.
3303307	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 you appear deep in thought. What a
kindly countenance.
3303331	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The hustle and bustle of the shopping
district outside is inaudible here.
3303335	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What is it? You look pensive.
3303337	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 I sense a minor shift in your aura.
3303361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What silent serenity. Here	 we many find
reprieve from all worldly thoughts.
3303366	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? Has your posture improved? You could
be mistaken for a Zen master with such a
statuesque pose.
3303368	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 you were quite entrenched in your
thoughts. Well then	 shall we be off?
3304031	Shop O<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>ner	Welcome! Oh? You're a young one.
3304032	Shop O<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>ner	We also have non-alcoholic drinks available.
Go ahead and sit wherever you like.
3304033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 this bar has a unique ambience. I sense
desire not found elsewhere.
3304034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Today's special drink should be a sensible
choice.
3304035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What an ostentatious color. It would be
impossible to surmise the flavor...
3304038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 it looks like it did not disappoint.
3304040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo. We're here	 so why not relax and
enjoy the bar's ambience?
3304061	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm curious about today's special drink.
3304062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My	 what a lovely hue. However	 we've yet to
sample it.
3304066	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I take it the drink is to your liking. Shall
we order another?
3304069	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's enjoy ourselves a while longer before
returning home.
3304151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I wonder what today's special could be.
3304152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm. The hue makes it look palatable	 but...
3304155	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh? Your expression has shifted. Hoohoo	 you
look like you're one of the regulars now.
3304158	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 since we're here	 why not savor the
moment a while longer?
3304181	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Today's special drink is only available for
a limited-time	 but it's quite... peculiar.
3304182	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The colors commingle yet remain beautifully
harmonious within the glass.
3304183	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 whatever could it taste like? Go on	
give it a try.
3304187	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You seem stunned.
3304188	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These new flavors have certainly brought
about a change in you.
3304190	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're in no hurry	 so let's enjoy ourselves.
3304212	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The hue tells us scant little of the taste.
3304215	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 your face brims with confidence.
While we're here	 might as well take a moment
to unwind.
3304241	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a stunning drink. Whatever could it
taste like?
3304244	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Slow down. I understand your enthusiasm	
but the drink isn't going anywhere.
3304245	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 what could have produced this
mysterious hue?
3304332	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 this drink has a tranquil hue	 but...
3304335	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 your expression has changed. You have
the look of someone who frequents
this establishment.
3304336	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's make the most of our time here and
take the chance to unwind.
3304361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Apparently this special drink is rarely
available. What luck!
3304363	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Go on	 take a sip.
3304366	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 the subtle flavor is to your liking? It
seems your expression has softened as well.
3305004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? {NAME2}?
3305005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 what's the matter with you?
3305008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 can you hear me? Could it be that you've
fallen asleep?
3305010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do try to stay alert. Well	 if you must...
Take a short rest if you wish.
3305032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	{NAME2}?
3305036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're free to enjoy the aroma	 but I also
require your attention... Are you listening?
3305063	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 are you all right?
3305066	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 wake up!
3305068	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I understand you're relaxed	 but who falls
asleep like that?
3410001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 how skilled. You even saved on materials.
3410002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 how skilled. You even made extra.
3410003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why	 for your very first tool	 this is
expertly made.
3410004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What craftsmanship! You saved on materials
without compromising quality.
3501001	Langu<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>d Male Student	My folks are away on business. I love the
freedom	 but now I'm low on cash...
3501002	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Male Student	Get a part-time job	 then. It's not against
school rules or anything.
3501003	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Male Student	Plus	 a lot of places are short-staffed right
now and looking for help.
3501004	Langu<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>d Male Student	A part-time job? Ugh	 sounds like a pain.
3501005	Langu<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>d Male Student	I don't wanna wooork... There's gotta be a
super easy job somewhere	 right?
3501006	Langu<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>d Male Student	Guess I'll check out a few job huntin' apps...
3501007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A part-time job... The Phantom Thieves do
need funds to operate. Why not get one too?
3501009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 such initiative.
3501010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't sound so pathetic.
3501011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't be ridiculous. What business would hire
an owl?
3501012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll find various leads on job search apps.
3501013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If a job interests you	 add it to your
scheduled activities.
3501014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's start with a place looking to hire
students and branch out from there.
3501020	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ckadaisical Male Student	Why the hell are exams even a thing?
Like	 seriously...
3501021	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ckadaisical Male Student	Even if I get a good score	 what good
will it do?
3501022	Letha<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>gic Female Student	It's not like I wanna go to the best
university or anything.
3501023	Letha<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>gic Female Student	Ughhh	 what's the freaking point
of studying?
3501024	Letha<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>gic Female Student	Can't we leave all the book crap
to the nerds? They actually like it.
3501025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I thought humans were highly
inquisitive creatures.
3501026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But it seems these ones have lost their
intellectual desire.
3501027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Study is always beneficial	 no matter the
field. That reminds me	 there's a bookstore
in Shibuya.
3501028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With a book you can study anywhere	
even at home.
3501035	Ne<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>scaster	Onto other news...
3501036	Ne<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>scaster	Research has shown lifestyle diseases are
prevalent among today's youth.
3501037	Ne<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>scaster	Cases are up since last year	 and officials
strive to promote a healthy lifestyle.
3501038	Ne<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>scaster	Now for the weather...
3501039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... So	 today's humans have even lost
their desire to stay healthy?
3501040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The situation is dire. You must also remain
vigilant.

remember something...

3303092	AAAAAA==	The surrounding noise is
fading away...
3303093	AAAAAA==	My mind feels strangely clear
when I come here...
3303094	AAAAAA==	I suddenly thought of a way to
use the new math formula we
learned in class...!
3303096	AAAAAA==	I think it'll help me study for efficiently!
3303122	AAAAAA==	The surrounding noise is
fading away...
3303123	AAAAAA==	My mind feels strangely clear

something on TV the other day.

and stand with style.
3303367	AAAAAA==	Good posture is important.
I'll keep it in mind.
3304000	AAAAAA==	The faint sound of music is
coming from inside...
3304001	AAAAAA==	People probably come here
to enjoy music and have
a few drinks...
3304002	AAAAAA==	Looks like they're not
open yet...
3304003	AAAAAA==	I'll come back another time.
3304036	AAAAAA==	I steeled myself and drank it.
3304037	AAAAAA==	It packs a punch	
but it tastes amazing...!
3304039	AAAAAA==	Trying new flavors took
some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>...
3304063	AAAAAA==	It really is a pretty color.
I wonder what's in it...
3304064	AAAAAA==	Bottoms up...
3304065	AAAAAA==	It tastes sweet yet mild.
3304067	AAAAAA==	The stimulating flavor gets
my mind running and keeps me
coming back for another sip...
3304068	AAAAAA==	I feel a growing thirst for
knowledge...
3304091	AAAAAA==	It's a vibrant green drink...
3304121	AAAAAA==	It's a pretty	 pink cocktail...
3304153	AAAAAA==	Here goes nothing...
3304154	AAAAAA==	It's slightly bitter yet
subtly sweet. The taste really
grows on me.
3304156	AAAAAA==	The slight bitterness brings
out the sweetness...
3304157	AAAAAA==	I think I've discovered a new
appreciation for drinks...
3304184	AAAAAA==	Here goes nothing...
3304185	AAAAAA==	...!
3304186	AAAAAA==	It's sweet	 sour	 and...
complex	 but each note works
together in perfect harmony.
3304189	AAAAAA==	I can't help but smile at the
taste of these strange
new flavors.
3304211	AAAAAA==	I ordered today's
special drink...
3304213	AAAAAA==	I steeled myself and drank it.
3304214	AAAAAA==	It's surprisingly good!
3304242	AAAAAA==	Let's try it...
3304243	AAAAAA==	I coughed a bit at first	 but
it actually tastes
pretty mild...
3304246	AAAAAA==	I leisurely sipped my drink
while imagining how it
was made...
3304271	AAAAAA==	Today's special is a
refreshing green drink...
3304301	AAAAAA==	Today's special is a
pretty	 pink drink...
3304331	AAAAAA==	The owner prepared today's
special drink...
3304333	AAAAAA==	The slight bitterness brings
out the sweetness...
3304334	AAAAAA==	The taste is growing on me...!
3304362	AAAAAA==	The drink has a strange mix
of colors. I wonder what it
tastes like...
3304364	AAAAAA==	I carefully bring the glass to
my lips for a taste...
3304365	AAAAAA==	You'd never guess by the way
it looks	 but the drink tastes
mild yet complex...
3304367	AAAAAA==	I feel relaxed... I think I'll
take my time and stay
a bit longer...
3305000	AAAAAA==	Apparently this caf√©
is quite popular...
3305001	AAAAAA==	I tried the owner's
recommended coffee blend...
3305002	AAAAAA==	It smells nice...
3305003	AAAAAA==	I feel like I've matured
a bit...
3305006	AAAAAA==	Taken by the aroma	 I close
my eyes...
3305007	AAAAAA==	It's like I've been set free.
I feel as though I've
discovered something...
3305009	AAAAAA==	I was so absorbed in the
coffee that I dozed off...
3305031	AAAAAA==	Bewitched by the coffee's
sweet aroma	 I closed
my eyes without thinking...
3305033	AAAAAA==	Lufel sounds far away...
3305034	AAAAAA==	Wrapped in the comforts of
coffee	 I feel like I've
discovered something...
3305035	AAAAAA==	I accidentally nodded off...
3305037	AAAAAA==	I'll slowly savor my coffee
before heading home...
3305061	AAAAAA==	I got to try a special blend
that was in the works.
3305062	AAAAAA==	I've never tasted anything
like this... The aroma is
making my head spin...
3305064	AAAAAA==	Lufel sounds far away...
3305065	AAAAAA==	As I drifted off to dreamland	
I feel like I
discovered something...
3305067	AAAAAA==	I closed my eyes for a second
and accidentally fell asleep...
3305069	AAAAAA==	That was nice. I guess I
should start heading home...
3501008	AAAAAA==	I'll look after school.|I don't wanna...|I thought you'd provide for us.
3501043	AAAAAA==	A gym... Maybe I should check
one out the next time
I'm in Shibuya...
3501050	AAAAAA==	It's a text from Mom.
3501055	AAAAAA==	Sounds like it'll be a
long vacation...
3501056	AAAAAA==	Come to think of it	 no one's
cleaned the house since
they left...
3501057	AAAAAA==	Guess it's up to me.
3501140	AAAAAA==	There's a nice caf√©...
3501141	AAAAAA==	No one seems to be inside...
3501142	AAAAAA==	It probably went
out of business...

3701140	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Right	 future plans! If you think of anything	 let me know	 okay?
3701141	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Thank you for speaking with me. Get home safe.
3700351	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Female Student	Look! Another post about that creep pouring some unknown liquid on people.
3700352	K<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en-Eared Female Student	Gross	 there's a video? Damn	 that's graphic...
3700353	Thin Fe<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ale Student	Someone's already sent it in for
<color=#FF423F>Divine Justice</color>. Do you think Magatsukami will
condemn him as a Menace?
3700002	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Female Student	Hang on	 that's like a serious crime. Shouldn't someone report it to the police?
3700003	Thin Fe<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ale Student	I don't know. It's kinda pointless	
don't you think?
3700004	K<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en-Eared Female Student	Every time there's a Menace	 the cops just
throw up their hands.
3700356	Long-<#000000	H	#FFFFFF>aired Female Student	Would you girls mind moving this chat to the cafeteria?
3700357	Long-<#000000	H	#FFFFFF>aired Female Student	No running in the halls.
3700358	K<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en-Eared Female Student	Tanemura-senpai just spoke to us!
3700005	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Female Student	A student council member AND she's loaded! Tanemura-senpai's like something out of a manga! *sigh* She's so cool.
3700359	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	Ugh...
3700302	Girl Call<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>d Tanemura	Are you okay? I noticed you having trouble passing through.
3700368	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	No need to thank me. Just doing my part.
3700369	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	I've seen lots of people acting self-involved
lately. Being inconsiderate to the people
around them and that kind of thing.
3700370	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	Don't forget that you can choose to stand up for yourself.
3700371	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	People have free will after all	 so speak up and use it.
3700374	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	Sorry. I guess you didn't ask for my advice.
3700372	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	I'll be going then.
3700400	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Owl	Is he really the one...? He certainly seems
as though it's been <color=#FF423F>stolen</color> from him...
3700401	A<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>sentminded Girl	......
3800020	F<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ippant Male Student	Hey	 did you see that video?
3800021	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>eepy Boy	Yes! That guy's such a creep! I really hope I never run into him.
3800022	F<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ippant Male Student	It's only a matter of time till he's declared a Menace.
3800023	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>eepy Boy	Come to think of it	 I saw someone steal an
umbrella right out of the stand the other
day. How's that for a Menace?
3701173	Station Announcement	The train is leaving the station.
3701174	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man Who Was Slammed	Hey!
3701177	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man Who Was Slammed	*sigh* Just great...
3701178	Apat<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>etic Man	Huh? What the hell!?
3701179	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ol-Headed Man	Someone's... up on the roof?
3701180	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>red-Looking Woman	No way... Is she gonna jump?
3701182	A<#000000	p	#FFFFFF>athetic Man	Ah...
3701183	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ol-Headed Man	Well	 from that height	 she'll probably live.
3701184	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>red-Looking Woman	I know how she feels. It's not like there's anything to live for.
3701185	A<#000000	p	#FFFFFF>athetic Man	Man	 I wish I caught that on video.
3800205	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Owl	So	 even without "it	 you still manage to question your own will?
3800207,S<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>range Owl,Hoo hoo... I found you.
3700501,S<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>range Owl,I knew you were the one.
3700502,S<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>range Owl,We meet again, as promised.
3700503,S<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>range Owl,I'll give you a piece of advice...
3700504,S<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>range Owl,There is a difference between that which never existed, and that which simply can't be seen.
3700505,S<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>range Owl,I sincerely hope that you are the latter.
3700601,???,I must say, of all the places to make an entrance, this isn't half bad.
3700602,???,If I squint really hard, you almost have a fierce look about you.
3700604,???,Hm, so you've come to.
3700605,???,Hm, that's a reasonable response.
3700606,???,It seems you still have hold of your curiosity. Heh, looks like finding you was worth the trouble.
3701172,???,I know your name... {PLAYER_NAME}, isn't it?
3700500,???,You may call me <color=#FF423F>Lufel</color>. I expect
your respect.
3700609,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hm? Do you not use names anymore?
3700610,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,How strange. And here I was sure I'd performed a perfect human introduction.
3700611,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Well... no matter. You must still be
confused.
3890095,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,But we're losing time, so I'll keep the explanation brief.
3700740,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Right now, you are not in the world you know. This realm is called the Metaverse."
3700612	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You might better understand it as "the collective unconscious	 where the masses' innermost cognitions coalesce.
3700613,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,In the real world, hope continues to be lost...
3700620,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,That's why this world appears to be on the verge of a terrible and tragic collapse.
3700777,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,You losing your desire to know is just one example.
3700778,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Humanity's hopes, desires, motivations... are being stolen out from under your noses.
3700779,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Believe it or don't. It makes no difference to me.
3800298,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,The fact remains, your hope was stolen. But I will show you how to get it back.
3700774,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Huh!?
3700614,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Looks like they found us... Follow me.
3800299,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We have to get out of here first. I'll explain the rest on the way.
3700775,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Just come on. All you need to know right now is that I'm on your side.
3700704,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What I said before, about humanity's hopes and desires being stolen...
3700705,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,You've sensed it yourself, haven't you?
3700706,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,When something goes wrong, you feel the urge to go against your instincts and throw in the towel.
3700709,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It's easy to forget that desire" can mean more
than greed or lust; it also fuels the will to live.
3700710	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If someone gives up on all of their desires
or has them stolen	 what do you think would happen to that person?
3700711	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You saw for yourself	 didn't you? Someone who
could not hold onto hope	 and so	 let go of life.
3700701	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course	 this won't spell the end of the
world immediately	 but...
3800300	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Little by little	 it will eat away at humanity	
and inevitably lead to ruin.
3800301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And the source responsible for this is...
3700712	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tsk	 so you plan to get in our way	 huh?
3700703	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Those are <color=#FF423F>Shadows</color>. In other words	 enemies.
They're here to kill us.
3700713	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They have no concept of morality. They attack
humans by nature.
3700714	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But these aren't their true forms. They're
influenced by someone powerful in the real world.
3700715	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I wonder if they're also responsible for 
draining the hopes from the crowd at the train station...
3700717	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. These Shadows...
3800302	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...are one part of how humanity's desires
are being stolen.
3700719	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For now	 you should run!
3700720	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No!
3700722	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is a difference between that which never existed	 and that which simply can't be seen.
3700733	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Is it possible that who you are now... is not the real you?
3700738	Merope	Consider this place a tunnel in a sea of souls	 paving the way to the innermost depths of your heart.
3700734	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Something was stolen from you‚Äîsomething that was meant to be yours	 and yours alone.
3700723	Student Called Tanemura	Don't forget that you can choose to stand up for yourself.
3700724	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Deception	 loss...
3700725	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	You continue to reject your own free will.
3700726	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. These Shadows are one part of how humanity's desires are being stolen.
3700728	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	How do you see yourself?
3700735	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	What will you do? You could end this story right here and now if you wanted to.
3700721	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	A lack of desire can lead to losing sight of yourself...
3700730	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	So	 I will ask you this once...
3700731	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	To remain lost... let go of your future	 and give up your life...
3700732	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Do you accept this as your decision?
3700739	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Yes! That's what I like to hear!
3700729	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*gasp* You...
3700750	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Let me see you break away from indifference by your own will.
3700751	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	You have chosen. Now make it so.
3700752	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Disregard what you have been told. Do not be afraid	 for if you can see it	 you must seize it.
3700753	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Could this be...?
3700754	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	Ahahahah! I thought this day might never come!
3700780	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Voice	I am <color=#FF423F>J√°no≈°√≠k</color>! Driver of your rapturous	
blazing desire...
3700781	J√°n<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>≈°√≠k	Henceforth we shall be bound	 as my mighty belt ties us to our destiny!
3700782	J√°n<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>≈°√≠k	The contract is formed.
3700783	J√°n<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>≈°√≠k	I am thou...
3800800	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That form... I can feel it... Its radiant	 bursting zeal for life!
3800808	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's probably no need to ask	 but are you ready to fight?
3800809	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Heheheh	 it's like you're a whole different person. Let's go!
3800802	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The enemy's getting ready to attack. They'll be certainly out for blood.
3800803	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you want to live	 you'd better put that weapon to use.
3800804	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Use it to slice up the enemy!
3800805	J√°n<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>≈°√≠k	What are you fighting for? Channel that desire into power... and unleash it!
3800806	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Masterfully done. You hardly need my assistance.
3800810	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Reinforcements	 huh... If the battle drags on	 it won't be in our favor. Time for a secret weapon.
3800807	J√°n<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>≈°√≠k	Now	 let your desires run free!
3700800	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like it's over...
3700801	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To think you awakened your <color=#FF423F>Persona</color> on your
own! Here I was thinking I'd have to walk
you through every step!
3700804	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is what you just witnessed. That power.
3700818	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is the name your power has given itself.
3700821	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A Persona is another self... A manifestation of your innermost desires.
3700822	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In this cruel world	 many struggle to see themselves clearly	 and yet you...
3700823	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Heheheh	 it seems as if I've chosen well. You may just become this world's hope.
3700820	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And if it wasn't clear	 your stolen desires are right back where they belong.
3700806	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us hurry onward.
3700807	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're still inside <color=#FF423F>Mementos</color>	 so Shadows
may attack us at any moment.
3700809	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I understand you must have many questions. But first	 we need to get out of here.
3700811	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If I die	 there will be no one left to answer your questions anyway.
3700813	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm glad you understand.
3700814	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You can run	 can't you?
3700815	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That battle likely caught the attention of other enemies nearby. We had better hurry.
3800650	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What terrible timing...
3800651	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I suppose now is as good a time as any. I'll show you the best way to knock down the enemy.
3800820	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is how you fight. Watch and learn.
3800821	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Some enemies have <color=#FF423F>weaknesses</color> you can
exploit to knock them down.
3800822	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Use that opening to strike again.
3800659	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like there's a big one headed this way. That must be what I was sensing earlier.
3800322	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh would you just‚Äî
3800340	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...Fine. Between your Persona awakening and back-to-back battles	 you must be feeling tired.
3800661	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There you are.
3800662	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Use that to heal when you're in a pinch. Let's move.
3800663	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh would you just‚Äî
3800664	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...Fine. Between your Persona awakening and back-to-back battles	 you must be feeling tired.
3700900	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're near the entrance.
3700901	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The exit should be right here	 but...
3700902	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait!
3700903	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I know you're there... If you're trying to hide	
you're not doing a very good job of it.
3700916	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	H-Hoo!?
3700905	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No... it's not him. He's not the one I
was sensing.
3700917	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But this area does seem to be linked to the source that stole your desire.
3700919	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Metaverse and the real world exist in parallel with each other. They're structurally linked	 which means...
3700920	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...there's someone in the real world whose desires are being exploited	 and their will to live stolen from them.
3700922	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm...? Looks like that struck a chord with you	 huh?
3700923	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This feeling... It appears we won't be able to take down this enemy easily.
3700908	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time to take on the mantle...
3700909	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Come forth	 <color=#FF423F>Robroy</color>!
3700910	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's only fair to warn you.
You're up against two beings who've lost everything.
3700912	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you try to get in our way	
we will take everything from you...
3700914	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...and color your defeat in crimson red!
3800830	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You took a hit! <color=#FF423F>Heal</color> yourself!
3800331	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like they're packing a powerful
wallop next! <color=#FF423F>Defend</color> yourself!
3799832	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here's the pummeling I promised.
3799333	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	{NAME2}	 I'll leave the finishing blow to you.
3798834	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Heed your desires!
3701007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nicely done.
3701009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That was quite the coup de grace. Your skill in battle's left me flabbergasted.
3701011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Flab-ber-gas-ted! It means	 to be surprised!
3701012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tell me	 do present day humans no longer use
such words? It would appear I must make
amendments to my body of knowledge.
3701000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If all goes well	 I was hoping we'd come across them	 but...
3701001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we'll need to gather more information first.
3701002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 witnessing the true scope of your
power was quite the boon.
3701003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems I'll have no problem putting you
to <color=#FF423F>work</color> right away.
3701005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's the exit. We'll talk in more detail
once we've safely made it out.
3701190	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A Shadow!?
3701191	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... I'm not sensing any hostility from it.
3701006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like a person...|Is it really a Shadow?
3701199	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Much is still unknown about Shadows.
3701200	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They come in many forms. Some are belligerent toward humans	 while others may be agreeable.
3701201	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They pillage the Metaverse	 lured by strong desires even if they're from a human...
3701202	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's possible to convince them to surrender or negotiate a trade depending on the Shadow's own desires.
3701192	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This one appears to just want to sell us
something. Seems there are a few irrepressible
entrepreneur types in the lot.
3701193	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can stop by when we have time.
3701194	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us hurry onward.
3701196	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I appreciate your enthusiasm	 but it'd be best for us to get going.
3701197	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My thoughts exactly. I'm glad you understand.
3701198	Saleswoman Shadow	*sigh*
3800307	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Owl	Are you curious about your outfit change?
3800310	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Owl	Allow me to explain. In the Metaverse	 the strength of our desire causes...
3701102	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Owl	Hey! Don't look at me like I'm a stranger. We just met each other's Personas a minute ago!
3701105	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. It's me	 Lufel.
3701108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tsk	 I was just about to explain that	 so if you don't mind...
3701109	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*screech* I was getting to that! Don't interrupt.
3800311	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Firstly	 in the Metaverse your clothing changes to reflect the will of your desires.
3800312	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In the event we're sensed by nearby enemies	 we become sheathed in the armor of our hearts	 so to speak.
3800313	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though	 that's not to say I'm 100% certain of this. Some theories posit the armor is a symbol of one's rebellious spirit.
3800314	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyhoo	 that's the long and short of it.
3700786	Male Passerby	Is that an owl?
3700787	Young-Lo<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>king Woman	City life sure has its surprises.
3701106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Apologies	 but perhaps we should call it a day. I was hoping not to stand out this much.
3701118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your intellectual curiosity is certainly admirable. But I think you've had enough for one day.
3701119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What with your Persona awakening and the previous battles	 you ought to head home and rest.
3800054	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do not worry... We will surely meet again
soon. After all	 I have a job to ask of you.
3800055	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Before then	 there's something I need to look
into. Once that's done	 I'll come find you.
3701112	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Arai	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!?
3701113	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Arai	How did he get here...?
3800000	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>llow Student	Hey	 ever feel like you can't muster up interest in anything?
3800001	Undeci<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ed Girl	What did you put for your answer to the last question?
3800002	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Boy	I couldn't think of anything	 so I just wrote "N/A."
3800003	Undeci<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ed Girl	Same here. It doesn't really matter what we choose	 anyway.
3800010	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Student	Honestly	 I can't even bring myself to think about what to do after graduation...
3800011	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Student	I've got no idea what school I want to go to.
3800012	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Student	The school probably only cares about the advancement rate.
3800050	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This way.
3800051	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Jump down.
3800052	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's keep going.
3800053	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Almost there.
3800204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You certainly appear to have gotten the hang of battle. Keep it up now.
3800206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We don't have much time. Let's make quick work of them.
3800304	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	{NAME1}-kun?
3800323	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Exploring this place any longer may put our lives at risk.
3800343	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is it	 I'm sure of it. Let's go	 Wonder.
3800350	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can hear something near the entrance. Stay vigilant and keep close to me!
3800360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That will get you nowhere. Try the other escalator instead.
3800361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't leave from here.
3800362	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's the wrong way.
3800363	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That way's too dangerous.
Let's leave it for now.
3800367	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've made good progress.
Why don't we take a seat and talk here?
3800368	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We might be able to find a suitable
workbench in Yongen-Jaya...
3800370	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A frontal assault would be difficult here.
Let's search for another path of entry.
3800371	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 follow me!
3800372	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should be able to sneak in to the Palace
from here. Stick close to me!
3800375	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First	 let's defeat an enemy with
<color=#FF423F>melee attacks</color>.
3800376	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 now try calling your <color=#FF423F>Persona</color>!
3800377	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your Persona allows you to call upon
fantastic power.
3800378	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Target the enemy's <color=#FF423F>weakness</color> to take
control of the battle.
3800379	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hitting an opponent's <color=#FF423F>weakness</color> lets
you do a <color=#FF423F>follow-up</color> attack.
3800380	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ugh... That was quite a powerful blow...
3800381	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But no need to panic	 this can be <color=#FF423F>healed</color>!
3800382	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems to be preparing a powerful attack.
3800383	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	At times like this	 survival should be your
first priority. <color=#FF423F>Guard</color>!
3800384	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't be careless here...
3800385	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There	 that's its<color=#FF423F>weakness</color>!
3800386	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is your chance!
3800393	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us enter Mementos without being spotted.
3800394	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 there's a strange noise coming from the
next room...
3800395	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should check it out.
3800460	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Careful	 there's a Shadow ahead.
3800461	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll find that being the one to initiate a
battle is to your advantage.
3800462	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Try to catch Shadows off guard and get
the first strike!
3800470	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This looks like a good spot.
3800471	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hide and strike while the enemy is unaware!
That's how a phantom thief should fight.
3800472	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 let's conceal ourselves.
3800601	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	First time fishing here? Have fun!
3800602	Fishing Pond At<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>endant	Every day's a perfect day for fishing!
3800603	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	How about it? Wanna cast a line?
3800604	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	All righty	 let's see what you got today!
3800605	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	A %d cm %s... That's %d points!
3800606	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	Ooh	 you landed a rare one! That's double
points	 so %d for this one.
3800607	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	Your current total is... %d points!
3800608	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	Wanna trade all of them in?
3800610	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well then	 what now?
3800613	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	You need a %d yen ticket to fish here. Wanna
buy a ticket?
3800614	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	Buy|Not now
3800615	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's next?
3800616	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>shing Pond Attendant	You don't have enough money.
3800617	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems you're out of bait.
3800618	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps you should purchase more?
3800631	Mune<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>isa Iwai	You again? What do you want?
3800657	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now we can set up a workbench here!
3800658	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Try making a hook.
3798840	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Use your <color=#FF423F>Gun</color> to aim for the enemy's
weak points and knock them down!
3798850	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is... a cognitive being.
3798851	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If I can be an asset to the team	 I'll rest easy.
3798852	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Start by targeting their weak points!
3798853	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Listen carefully!
3798854	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The flying ones are weak to gunfire. Shoot
them down.
3798855	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This Shadow looks formidable.
3798856	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Search the Palace while avoiding fights
with Shadows.
3798857	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come forth	 <color=#FF423F>Awilda</color>! Let's take back
what's ours!
3798858	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This girl... Did she awaken?
3798859	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Never a dull moment around you	 Wonder!
3798863	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense the presence of a special Shadow
nearby... Keep an eye out for it.
3798864	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a Treasure Demon! Defeat it	 and its
treasure will be ours!
3798865	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's proceed with hunting down our target.
3798866	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can sense danger in the area ahead...
But	 with danger also comes treasure...
3798867	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... That treasure chest is sealed with
chains. I wonder what might happen if we
<color=#FF423F>defeated the Shadow</color> beside it...
3798870	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The area beyond this point is completely
under Kiuchi's control. It would be wise to
proceed only when you're fully prepared.
3798871	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's your call	 Wonder!
3798872	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sure!
3798875	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's a <color=#FF423F>Depraved Shadow</color>.
Defeat it	 and you'll get <color=#FF423F>something good</color>.
3798876	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Bringing it down may help us reach the next
area	 but be prepared for a tough fight!
3798877	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something isn't right... Let's go back to
that machine.
3798878	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seems to be something behind us. Maybe
we can use it to open the door?
3798879	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seem to be Shadows nearby.
3798880	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's nothing left here. Let's try
somewhere else.
3798881	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't let your guard down just because the
enemy is alone.
3798882	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed	 in cases like this...
3798883	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's best to use <color=#FF423F>single-target</color>
skills to attack.
3798884	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems the numbers are against us... Let's
proceed with caution.
3798885	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To take out all of our foes efficiently...
3798886	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's best to use <color=#FF423F>multi-target</color>
skills to attack.
3798887	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The enemies here are protected by some sort
of ward.
3798888	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's avoid direct confrontation until we
know more.
3798889	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First	 secure some method of <color=#FF423F>healing</color>	
then try to <color=#FF423F>knock the enemy down</color>.
3798890	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It doesn't look like we can sneak in here.
Let's try elsewhere.
3798891	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This isn't where we need to go right now.
3798892	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This isn't where we need to go right now.
Our priority is to <color=#FF423F>defeat Kiuchi</color>.
3798893	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I never imagined <color=#FF423F>slamming into things</color>
would bring us here. Let's explore.
3798894	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've uncovered a hidden area. Let's
investigate.
3798898	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	You know I'm only using 50% of my power	
right? This ain't even a warm-up for me!
3798899	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Oh	 I'm getting fired up now! Playtime is
over for you kids.
3798900	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	I feel it! My power's building up!
Say your prayers!
3989901	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's not an attack you want to take
head-on. You'd better guard this one.
3989902	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Pardon the interruption.
3989903	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have arranged a mock battle to help you
hone your skills. I would like you to try.
3989904	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please keep this in mind.
3989905	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This trial... I suppose we can call it the
<color=#FF423F>Velvet Trial</color> for convenience's sake.
3989912	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I will provide special phantom idols to
help whip your combat know-how into shape.
3989906	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now if you don't mind	 let us
begin the trial.
3989907	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let me commend you on a battle well fought.
Your commands were undeniably splendid.
3989908	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That will be all for this trial.
3989909	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If you would like to try again	 just find
me in Mementos and ask.
3989913	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... I hear a voice coming from the
depths of Mementos.
3989914	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Some new entity may have appeared.
3989915	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This may require investigation.
3899916	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we want to go further	 we'll need to
defeat this one.
3899917	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Be cautious. It feels powerful.
3899918	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm...?
3899919	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Isn't that the peculiar-looking Shadow we
saw earlier?
3899920	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Do you two know her?
3899921	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We met her before you joined us...
But what's more curious is that machine there.
Wonder	 perhaps we should investigate.
3899922	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Shadow	Howdy! So wonderful to see you again!
3899923	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Shadow	Did this ol' hunk o' junk here catch your
eye? Why don't ya come over here and take
a closer look?
3899924	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't sense any malicious intent	 but...
what precisely is your objective here?
3899925	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>range Shadow	Well	 sugars	 what can I say? <color=#FF423F>Marthym</color>'s the
name	 makin' sales is my game! And y'all look
like you could benefit from my services.
3899926	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	With so few customers about these days	 I'd
be plum crazy not to take this opportunity!
3899927	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Anyways	 about this machine. I'll spill them
beans for ya.
3899928	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Now take a good look at this beauty!
3899929	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	This here is a <color=#FF423F>Fare Machine</color>	 and it's your
ticket to satisfying that hankerin' y'all got
for adventure!
3899930	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Just slide your <color=#FF423F>Train Tickets</color> into the
slot and you're all set. Simple as pie!
3899931	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	You'll find tickets scattered everywhere like
leaves durin' fall	 so make sure to collect
'em. Good things happen to those who do.
3899932	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I'll bet my sandals it'll cause the area
nearby to <color=#FF423F>shift</color> in ways you can't imagine...
3899933	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Now go get yourselves a good heap of those
tickets and try it out!
3899934	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	There're plenty of fare adjustment machines
all around Mementos	 so don't hold back!
3899935	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This woman and her sales pitches... Clearly	
we have no use for this.
3899936	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Well excuse me darlin'	 but it's not just me
who benefits from you using them machines.
You'd regret sitting this one out!
3899937	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. Wonder	 what do you think?
3899939	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 I trust your judgment.
3899940	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't really get what's going on here	
but I don't feel like she's out to cause
trouble for us.
3899941	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Error: tnxotb-[3899941]
3899942	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	AAAAAA==
3899943	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Error: tnxotb-[3899943]
3899944	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something's changed in Mementos	 I can
feel it in the air. We should investigate.
3899945	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we go right now?
3899946	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's investigate.|Let me think about it.
3899947	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 let's make haste.
3899948	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll be waiting here	 then.
3899949	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do apologize for my uninvited arrival.
3899950	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have come to offer you a new service
as your concierge.
3899951	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Providing this service required a great
deal of research on my part.
3899952	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I learned that the words<color=#FF423F>limited time only</color>
hold great power over human hearts.
3899953	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Therefore	 I created a limited-time-only
trial to give you greater motivation.
3899954	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have titled this limited-time-only trial
<color=#FF423F>The Trials from the Sea of Souls</color>.
3899955	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please understand that this trial has been
made time-limited to improve your experience.
3899956	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Additionally	 you will need to find your way
to the<color=#FF423F>Path of Aiyatsbus</color> to undertake
this trial.
3899957	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would appreciate it if you would come
as soon as possible.
3899959	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Understood. I will be waiting for you in
the appointed place.
3899960	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah	 I see. In that case	 I will wait here
until you are ready.
3910457	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Thank you for speaking with me. If you would
allow me	 I wish to propose a special plan
that I have devised for you.
3910459	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have prepared a trial space in which you
may battle powerful enemies... In other
words	 a place for training your desire.
3910464	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	AAAAAA==
3910465	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like to begin at once. Are you
prepared to start?
3910466	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hmhm	 a splendid display of desire.
Let us begin.
3710479	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Understood. Speak to me again when you
are ready.
3910473	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have prepared a trial space in which you
may battle powerful enemies... In other
words	 a place for training your desire.
3910474	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like to begin at once. Are you
prepared to start?
3910476	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hmhm	 a splendid display of desire.
Let us begin.
3910477	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Understood. Speak to me again when you
are ready.
3899961	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... So this is the strange area I sensed?
3899962	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you remember what I told you about
Palaces before the fight with Kiuchi?
3899963	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It was... After we beat Kiuchi	 the Palace
disappears. Cattle said it	 right?
3899964	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Then at some point the Palace
might show up again	 right?
3899965	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. Now just as I predicted	 the lingering
cognition of Kiuchi's Palace lies ahead.
3899966	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A "lingering cognition"...!? What the heck
does that mean?
3899967	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The ruler's Shadow is gone	 but old memories
and cognition may have restored it.
3899968	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So Kiuchi's Palace is still here!?
3899969	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Does that mean everything we did stealing
the treasure is just... undone now?
3899970	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 no need to worry. There's no sign of
his treasure here.
3899971	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To venture a guess... this place may be the
<color=#FF423F>cognition of Kiuchi's palace itself</color>.
3899972	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The cognition of the Palace itself...
3899973	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can sense the Palace ruler here too.
Likely another cognition	 but we should check.
3899974	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	<color=#FF423F>%s</color>! Lend me strength!
I'm gonna tear these brats apart!
3899975	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>voted Girl	3	 2	 1!
Kiuchi	 Kiuchi	 ace pitcher Kiuchi!
3899976	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>lusional Girl	Let's go	 Kiuchi!
Kiuchi the undefeated!
3899977	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems like we can't get in now.
3901414	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	My apologies for appearing unannounced.
3901415	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have once again prepared a special trial.
3901416	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As always	 I must ask to you go to the trial
location in <color=#FF423F>Area 3 of the Path of Qimranut</color>.
3901418	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I will be waiting in <color=#FF423F>Area 3 of the
Path of Qimranut</color>.
3901419	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Understood. Speak to me again when you
are ready.
3901423	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Watch your health during difficult fights.
You mustn't neglect your healing!
3901424	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll need to <color=#FF423F>heal</color> before anything else.
3901426	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We won't be able to continue here now...
Let's settle things elsewhere.
3901427	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Leader	 I have a proposal to make...
3901428	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why don't we head back to Miyazawa's Palace
and try exploring even deeper?
3901430	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That may be so	 but I'm not proposing this
without good reason.
3901431	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Firstly	 the shadows will not anticipate
us returning to the palace so soon after
leaving.
3901432	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd wager that if we went now	 they would
have their guards down.
3901433	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Secondly	 the shadows will need time to reassemble their forces.
3901434	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Thus	 I believe there is no better time to
act. What do you say	 Leader?
3901436	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very good. Then off we go.
3901437	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very well... Then I shall be waiting here.
Do let me know if you change your mind.
3901438	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 we should be ready to complete that
deal with Marthym now!
3901439	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right! Ah	 but there's still lots of tickets
lying around. Shouldn't we pick 'em up?
3901440	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I shall leave that decision up to Wonder.
3901441	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are still tickets lying around.
3901442	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think you'll need to defeat the <color=#FF423F>Shadows
in the back</color> before I can continue.
3901451	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 could we discuss something?
3901452	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course.|Maybe later?
3901453	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sorry about that.
3901443	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I just realized I should tell you...
3901444	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've noticed something rather disquieting
during our recent explorations.
3901445	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I had convinced myself it was just a Shadow	
but I've now realized what it truly is.
3901446	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's the presence of a Palace ruler. It's
different from before	 but there's no doubt.
3901447	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't know why such a presence would
reappear	 but we must investigate at once.
3901449	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 I do value your decisiveness!
Let's go	 Wonder!
3901450	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's something else I need to tell you...
3901454	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ibuya's Shichi-kun	A new attraction just opened!
Want to hear all about it?
3801001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The door here is locked. Let's search the
area for anything unusual first.
3801002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That round hole in the middle... Something
probably goes in there.
3801003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like that unlocked it... Let's check
that door from earlier.
3801012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps we could open this door by solving
the puzzle we saw earlier...
3801013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Use your environment to hide in enemy
territory! That's the way of a Phantom Thief.
3801014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 already putting it into practice!
That's our Wonder.
3801015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The door doesn't seem to open from
this side.
3801016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There should be a way around. Let's find it.
3801022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like we can't open the door yet. Let's
look around the room first.
3801023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we're unable to enter. Let's press
on for now.
3801024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A phantom thief must also know how to avoid
unnecessary conflict. Be careful here!
3801025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom! I sense a presense much stronger
than the other shadows... Be on your guard	
Wonder!
3801030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 we should search the area for clues.
3801035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This looks like a specialized lock...
Perhaps it needs to be disabled remotely?
3801037	Voice on Scr<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en	Unauthorized access.
3801038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No response... Nothing we can do here now.
3801040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We were very nearly spotted just now!
3801041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This route is thick with Shadows.

3801085a	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't worry. Locks like this are mere
child's play.

3801193	Voice on Scr<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en	Obtaining 12 trophies is a feat only
Kiuchi-sama is great enough to achieve!
3801194	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes!
3801195	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes!
3801200	Voice on Scr<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en	......
3801201	Voice on Scr<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en	For access to the guide	 please consult
the administrative staff.
3801202	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems like we got the order wrong.
3801203	Voice on Scr<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en	F0r acCeSs to thththe guide	 please cons-slt
the admini#%^ staff...
3801204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? This looks promising!
3801205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? This looks promising!
3801206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We have the order wrong. Hm	 wasn't that
Shadow over there an administrator?
3801207	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm	 maybe we got the order wrong?
3801207a	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What did the Shadow say again...?
<color=#FF423F>3	 1	 3	 2	 0</color>?
3801209	Voice on Scr<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>en	Configuration complete. Access to the guide
is now restricted.
3801210	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 where are you going?
3801211	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You know we can't go through the front
entrance. We need a different way in.
3801220	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 what's this?
3801222	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is... a <color=#FF423F>Palace map</color>.
3801224	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So we can just find out where the treasure
is by looking at this?
3801226	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not that simple	 I'm afraid. This map
shows only one section of the Palace.
3801228	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Should've known it wouldn't be that easy...
But	 we can use this to tell where we
haven't been yet	 right?
3801230	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 indeed. However... there are some areas
that we cannot reach. For now	 let us keep
moving forward.
3801240	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh	 what is this?
3801242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 it's a card with Kiuchi on it!
3801244	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess it's a kind of <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>	 like for
a pro baseball player's fan club?
3801246	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then I take it that the big <color=#FF423F>C</color> on it means
it's for <color=#FF423F>C-tier</color> fans?
3801248	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We might be able to use this to get into
areas we couldn't access before!
3801250	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	While exploring every nook and cranny
of the Palace is important	 stealing the
Treasure is still our first priority.
3801252	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would seem that the <color=#FF423F>elevator</color> we passed
earlier will bring us closer to the Treasure.
3801254	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But the elevator wasn't working...
3801256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No matter. If my suspicions are correct	
we just need to take this mechanism here...
3801258	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And if we press this...
3801260	Announc<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ment	The elevator is now operating.
3801262	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow	 it worked!
3801264	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo! Now	 shall we board the elevator
and head for the treasure?
3802000	Announc<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ment	The training area is currently closed.
3802001	Announc<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ment	Please use the <color=#FF423F>southern gym</color> instead.
3802002	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rst Baseman	You're the intruders? Well you're not getting
past this base. Not with me to guard it!
3802003	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>nouncement	The elevator is now operating.
3802005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should be able to activate the elevator
from the room ahead	 but that Shadow looks
rather formidable...
3802006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks pretty tough! Better get ready first.
3802007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. Better to form an attack plan before
approaching it.
3802010	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>nouncement	At Kiuchi-sama's recommendation	 today's
exercise will focus on core strength.
3802011	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>nouncement	Please push the equipment box onto
the plate marked with the emblem.
3802012	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 that's that then!
3802012a	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ughty Man's Voice	Huh? I didn't say "do chores	 I said to do
core training exercises!
3802012b,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hey, wasn't that Kiuchi's voice just now?
3802012c,K<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>uchi's Voice,There, you got some core training in, right?
So now you can help me with my routine!
3802012d,K<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>uchi's Voice,...What? You've got your own training to do?
3802012e,K<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>uchi's Voice,Sorry, but mine's higher priority! Yours
doesn't have the same prospects	 okay?
3802012f,K<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>uchi's Voice,That TV anchor lady's here to interview me.
If I don't impress her, it'll ruin my image!
3802012g,K<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>uchi's Voice,You get it now? Then hurry up and
give me a hand!
3802013,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>nouncement,The base runner has been tagged out!
Please restart and try again.
3802014,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Pushing the box around won't do anything.
Let's look around the room some more.
3802016,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems as though this door won't open...
3802017,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Why is the middle of the display case empty?
It's like something's missing...
3802018,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Do you think this case has something to do
with unlocking the door?
3802019,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Perhaps we should try a different room.
3802021,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Isn't this ball the same kind they had on
display in that case?
3802022,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom... Shall we go back and check?
3802023,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I was right, it's the same ball! Let's put it
in that suspiciously empty slot!
3802024,Announc<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>ment,Team members who have finished their core
exercises, proceed to the next exercise.
3802025,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Good, it seems we can proceed now!
3802030,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hey, this looks just like that <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>
we picked up earlier.
3802031,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,They do indeed look similar! This one appears
to be... <color=#FF423F>B-Tier</color>?
3802032,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,So we've risen in the ranks of Kiuchi's fan
club, huh? Can't say I'm exactly thrilled...
3802033,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Still, having this card should grant us
access to further locations.
3802034,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Wonder, let's keep an eye out for places to
use this card as we proceed.
3802040,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Judging from the map, there's a lot of
exercise equipment in this area.
3802041,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Well, stadiums have spaces for the athletes
to train in, so this must be one of those
areas, right?
3802042,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,We saw a lot of stuff like this earlier, too.
3802043,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom, you're right. As with that training
exercise earlier, who knows what awaits us?
We must proceed with caution.
3802050,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Whoa, what are pitching machines doing here!?
3802051,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,A former pitcher, attacking people with
baseballs... How twisted.
3802052,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,No kidding... Those things fire balls at a
crazy speed. Getting hit by one would
seriously hurt!
3802053,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Indeed. We'll need to proceed with extreme
caution to avoid getting hit.
3802055,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hey, look! There's no fencing around that
machine!
3802056,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,You're right. We may be able to destroy it.
3802057,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah! Breaking it would make exploring
easier, right?
3802058,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We can either continue dodging the balls,
or destroy the machine... It's up to
you, Wonder.
3802060,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,The <color=#FF423F>diary</color> that Shadow mentioned earlier
may contain some kind of hint.
3802061,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We can also proceed deeper into the palace.
Your choice, Wonder.
3802065,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,Kiuchi-sama's exercise regime from hell
really wore me out today...
3802066,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,But, I made it through with <color=#FF423F>Senpai</color>'s
support!
3802067,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,Senpai is just a reserve player, but he
still hasn't given up on becoming
first-baseman!
3802068,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,He says he has to keep practicing to be
ready<color=#FF423F>when he's finally called up</color>.
3802069,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,I wonder if he's training alone in the
<color=#FF423F>South Gym</color> again today...
3802070,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,He says you gotta work to be in the main
lineup. Kiuchi-sama doesn't need weaklings!
3802071,S<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>meone's Diary,I've gotta keep trying too...
3802072,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh, the Shadows are competing with
each other?
3802073,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It sounds like the <color=#FF423F>senpai</color> mentioned in the
diary is a reserve first baseman.
3802074,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,There's a closed area in the gym left of the
elevator. Maybe that's where this senpai is.
3802075,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,If he's a reserve team member, maybe he'd
appear if the regular first basemen is gone?
3802080,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Wait, I hear a voice from that room...
3802081,P<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>e-Practice Shadow,Okay, finished writing my <color=#FF423F>diary</color> entry, now
I'd better get back to practice!
3802082,P<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>e-Practice Shadow,Whoa, who are you!?
3802083,P<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>e-Practice Shadow,You're those devious intruders going
after Kiuchi-sama, aren't you?
3802085,Trap-S<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>tting Shadow,Okay! I've set the trap, just like
Kiuchi-sama ordered.
3802086,T<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ap-Setting Shadow,Hey, who's that!?
3802087,T<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ap-Setting Shadow,You must be the intruders!
3802095,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,It looks like moving this box also moves that
pitching machine.
3802096,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Look at the rail on the floor! You may be
able to move the pitching machine with that.
3802097,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We can't reach from here. Let's move the box
so we can get it into the other room.
3802110,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,The equipment reset!? Hoom... It seems you
have to keep standing on it somehow.
3803001,Voice on Scr<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>en,Starting the Game Simulator. Follow the
instructions on screen to reenact the game.
3803002,Voice on Scr<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>en,Game reenactment inaccurate.
You have failed.
3803003,Voice on Scr<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>en,Success. Accept this trophy as a mark of your
victory.
3809001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,According to the map, there should be a path
just ahead... But it doesn't seem we can
get through.
3809002,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,It looks too heavy for us to move...
Oh! Unless...
3809003,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What is it, Closer?
3809004,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh, well, I thought I saw some boxes we
could smash through back the way we came...
3809005,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Maybe there's another way through!
Wanna check it out?
3809006,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom... It could be another way through.
Let us proceed, then.
3809010,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,According to the map... This area is Kiuchi's
club."
3809012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The control room for this area is on the
first floor. We can start the elevator there.
3809014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So we head there first?
3809016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This map has no details for the third floor.
It might not lead to anything	 but...
3809018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But we always needed to start the elevator
to make progress	 right?
3809020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is true. Wonder	 let's go to the control
room first.
3809030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 this mark on the door here... I can't
really make out what it is.
3809031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph... Perhaps that is deliberate.
They could be hiding something from those who
don't know its meaning.
3809040	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You think we should go over there? But I
don't think we can get past the fence...
3809041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's nothing to be done about that now.
Let us think of a solution.
3809042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First	 let's search the area	 Wonder.
3809045	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	When you step here	 the upper part reacts.
So if we keep an eye on that...
3809047	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So we follow the hints on the floor	 and that
should activate the mechanism.
3809048	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like a hint appeared over there.
We should check it out.
3809050	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like the red one is a trap.
3809051	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So we want to avoid the red ones. Gotcha!
3809100	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's an enemy ahead. Watch out.
3809105	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	An electric fence... Security's getting
tighter as we go	 huh.
3809105a	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Kiuchi's becoming more wary	 I expect.
It means we're getting closer to the treasure.
3809106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If the fence is electrified	 there must be a
power source somewhere...
3809106a	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So we just need to find the power and take it
out. Let's look around here first.
3809107	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent	 the power is cut. Shall we proceed?
3809110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 this is a larger area.
3809111	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	They've got the same traps here from before.
Why put them around an empty space?
3809112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 there should be a <color=#FF423F>power box</color>
near here. Let's look for it.
3809115	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hrm	 so taking out that box wasn't enough to
take out the power. We'll have to find more.
3809120	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The hall's blocked off... Maybe there's
another way to get up there?
3809122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent climbing!
3809125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a symbol on the plate by the door.
It's a... raised thumb gesture?
3809126	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A thumbs-up	 yeah. There's a light over there
with the same symbol on it.
3809126a	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps this means... Wonder	 could you try
pushing that light for me?
3809127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I thought	 we need to push the door plate
and the matching light in order!
3809127a	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3809127b	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah... What is it	 Closer?
3809127c	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi did this pose a lot when he was still
playing	 right?
3809127d	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know how the infielders gather on the
pitcher's mound when they need to strategize?
3809127e	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	When they finish their huddle	 they all
do this pose.
3809127f	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess he'd been doing it since high school.
3809127g	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I used to imitate it as a little kid	 even.
3809127h	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Plenty of other kids did the same	 too.
3809127i	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He took all those kids' admiration and shit
all over it! I'll never forgive him	 ever.
3809127k	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah... Sorry	 I was rambling. Let's go.
3809130	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>cable</color>is going into this room...
There's a strange mark on the door	 too.
3809132	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>cable</color>'s over here!
3809133	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So it goes through this room...
3809134	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's an odd mark here too.
Let's take a closer look.
3809135	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another one	 really? That's even more places
we can enter now.
3809140	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's up with this room? Part of the floor's
glowing red!
3809140a	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The glowing red part seems dangerous.
But what on earth was that just now?
3809140b	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think it was some kind of... tag out? A
glove-looking thing came out and...
3809140c	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What on earth is a tag out?
3809140d	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh... I'm not sure how to explain...
You tag a runner while holding the ball	
and they're out?
3809140e	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A rule from baseball	 then. So maybe it's an
expression of Kiuchi's attachment to baseball?
3809140f	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In any case	 we need to reach the destination
while avoiding the glowing red spots.
3809141	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's probably it. Watch where you step here	
Wonder!
3809145	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You made it across. Excellent poise
as always.
3809146	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's a <color=#FF423F>right-facing</color> light here...
Let's try pushing it.
3809150	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>cable</color> goes to this room...
3809151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The cable passes through	 but the door won't
open. Is that odd symbol the key?
3809153	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't see any other exits.
3809154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hang on	 we may be able to return to the
previous hall via the air vents.
3809160	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 another power line down!
We'll have 'em all out soon.
3809161	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's further to go still. Shall we
investigate there too?
3809165	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There was a light with the same symbol as
this door in that passage earlier.
3809167	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This isn't the right place.
3809170	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This door is locked. There may be a key
somewhere nearby.
3809172	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's room for another ball in this case.
Maybe a pink or purple one?
3809173	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should be able to open that door now with
this ball. Let's go back and try it out.
3809175	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another light? Maybe this will open the
inner door.
3809177	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is that flashing some kind of countdown?
This one may have a <color=#FF423F>time limit</color> on it.
3809178	Worshipp<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Shadow	Kiuchi-sama! I've been waiting so long!
3809179	Worshipp<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Shadow	Huh!? Who are you!? Don't tell me you're those
intruders that Kiuchi-sama warned us about!?
3809180	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The same trap again. You can handle
this	 Wonder!
3809185	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Amazing as always	 Wonder!
3809190	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With this	 the locked door should open.
3809195	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a switch on the back here.
3809200	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now the electrified traps in the big hall
should be down. Let's go check.
3809210	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This floor seems far more difficult
than the others... Keep your wits about you	
Wonder!
3809211	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Be careful	 Wonder!
3809220	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I admit I never imagined this hall's entire
floor could be a trap...
3809223	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A passage? Here?
3809230	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... We've barely had time to catch our
breath so far. A break is in order.
3809233	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If there are Shadows here	 that means they're
guarding something valuable	 right?
3809234	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 to battle!
3809236	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We are regarded as <color=#FF423F>A-Tier</color> Kiuchi fans now.
3809237	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think assigning tiers to your own fans is
pretty gross	 to be honest.
3809238	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're making good progress toward the
treasure. Let's stay focused!
3809239	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! Whatever Kiuchi's twisted desires are	
we've got to steal them away!
3809240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think we just have to push this on the
control panels and then...
3809241	Announc<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ment	Everyone	 gather at the playing field!
Kiuchi-sama's exhibition match will
soon begin!
3809242	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	An exhibition match? Whatever that means	 it
sounds like Kiuchi is at center field.
3809245	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow	 that looks like a super rare <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>.
3809246	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	S-Tier? That sounds like it should be
the highest rank.
3809247	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're close to totally conquering
this palace	 right?
3809248	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The treasure is within our grasp... But there
are some areas we haven't explored yet.
3809249	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we want to be as thorough as possible	 we
could go there first. It's up to Wonder.
3809250	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Howdy there! Have you ever wanted to
try fishing?
3809251	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	There's a super-duper amazing <color=#FF423F>fishing pond</color>
in <color=#FF423F>Ichigaya</color>!
3809252	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Go check it out sometime! You'll have a
reel-y great time!
3809260	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Are you into working up a sweat? Swinging a
bat? Making balls fly? All of the above!?
3809261	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	There's some super-duper great <color=#FF423F>batting cages</color>
in <color=#FF423F>Yongen-Jaya</color>!
3809262	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	You should go and give it a try for sure!
You'll have a ball!
3809263	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Howdy there! Do you like capsule toys?
3809264	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Well	 there happen to be some irresistibly
cute <color=#FF423F>Shichi-kun capsule toys</color> available now!
3809265	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	You can find them in the capsule machines
right here in Shibuya	 so be on the lookout!
3809266	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	You can put 'em on display	 carry 'em around	
anything you want! Woof-woof!
3809267	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something seems to be changing in the
Metaverse...
3809268	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This may require investigation.
3809350	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something seems to be changing in the
Metaverse...
3809351	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This may require investigation.
3809270	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3809271	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's wrong	 Cattle? Something on your mind?
3809272	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 no... It's nothing important	 but...
3809273	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 as you're fully aware...
3809274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In the Metaverse	 the threat of Shadows
means we're constantly looking over
our shoulders.
3809275	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I just wish we had a safe spot to enjoy
leisurely conversations in the Metaverse.
Like Wonder's house in the real world.
3809276	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That does sound nice... but a place like
that's gonna be super hard to find.
3809277	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Quite. One doesn't just stumble upon such
hidden treasures so conveniently...
3809278	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Well	 it seems like someone could benefit
from some assistance!
3809279	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 it's you!
3809281	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I didn't come here to sell anything	 silly.
I came to offer you some humble guidance!
3809282	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you mean?
3809283	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I shall explain everything you need to know...
when we get there!
3809284	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Today	 my lovely customers	 I would like to
introduce you to... the Companio!
3700743	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Companio...? What does that even mean? Um...
what should we do	 Wonder?
3700745	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you say so	 then very well. But we should
remain cautious.
3809285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Where are we?
3809286	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	This here is the main area of the Companio!
3809287	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I care little for what it's called. The
question is... what exactly is this place?
3809288	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	We are standing in a crevasse between the
past and present. Where the wills of the
masses surge and flow...
3700746	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	In simpler terms	 a lot of strange things
happen here!
3700747	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Strange things	 you say? Hmm...
3809289	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not sensing any danger from this...
Companio. Am I correct in thinking you are
offering this place to us?
3809353	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Indeed I am! Here	 take this. It's all the
fine print!
3809354	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	By the by	 there are certain items that can
only be found here.
3700770	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Helpin' me collect 'em would certainly be
one way of repayin' the favor...
3809355	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So that's your motive for bringing us here.
A shrewd business plan indeed.
3809356	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But	 I think we've found ourselves a rather
decent base in the Metaverse...
3700749	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should discuss this before we make a
decision. Could you give us a moment?
3809357	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Why	 of course!
3809358	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll head back to Mementos for now	 then.
3809359	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Come back anytime!
3809360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right... Now	 let's hear both of your
thoughts on this.
3809361	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why not give it a shot? The "strange things
happen there" aspect of it is kinda spooky	
but otherwise	 it sounds kinda fun!
3809362	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 while I'm not against it	 I don't think
we should be making this decision lightly...
3809363	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In that case	 maybe Wonder should make the
call. He's the leader after all.
3809364	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose so... All right then. What we do is
up to you.
3809290	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Perfect timing	 {NAME2}! I was hoping
I'd bump into you!
3809291	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I was wondering if I could ask you for
a favor...
3809293	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I knew I could count on you!
3809327	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 so the band club is looking for an
extra member.
3809328	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I'm not really in a position to help them...
so I was wondering if you might be
able to help them instead!
3809330	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 no need to worry about that! The club's
vice president is Ritsuka Takanashi...
3809331	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...and she'll teach you everything from
scratch! So do you think you could help 'em
out!? Promise to treat you to a burger!
3809332	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 and there should be a post for band club
on the club bulletin board with more details	
so be sure to check it out!
3809294	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Oh	 you must be {NAME1}	 right?
Motoha told me about you.
3809295	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I'm really sorry for the sudden request.
If there's ever anything you're unsure about	
feel free to ask me anytime.
3809296	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Okay	 how about you play something for me to
start off with? That way	 I can come up with
a suitable practice routine for you!
3809297	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	No need to to be shy. Music's all about
having fun!
3809298	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 perfect timing	 {NAME2}! Guess what?
3809299	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've got just the perfect workout plan
for you! Wanna hear it?
3809301	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I was hoping you'd say that!
3809302	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then without further ado	 allow me to
introduce... the soccer team captain	
Yota Kurosawa-kun!
3809303	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	So you're {NAME1}	 huh? Arai was telling me
about you!
3809304	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You seem to be in pretty good shape	
just like she said! Sharp eyes	 too!
3809305	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha	 as you can see	 Kurosawa-kun here's
a pretty energetic guy.
3809306	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It's all thanks to soccer! It doesn't just
strengthen your leg muscles	 but your
heart	 too...
3809307	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on	 let's back up a sec. We haven't
even explained the situation to
{NAME2} yet!
3809308	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Oop	 sorry!
3809309	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So Kurosawa-kun told me that one of the
members of the soccer team was injured and
can't play anymore...
3809310	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He said that they're looking for another player	
and I was wondering if you might be
interested.
3809311	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I bet soccer training would make the perfect
workout plan for our operations.
3809313	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Haha	 well	 we've all gotta start somewhere	
right? Don't worry! As captain	 I'll support
you every step of the way!
3809314	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Hey	 don't sell yourself short! I bet you'll
love soccer if you just give it a shot!
3809315	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Good luck	 {NAME2}. I'll be cheerin'
for ya!
3809316	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you remember that ominous-looking door in
the Companio?
3809326	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nightmare's Gateway... was it? I don't know
why	 but it worries me.
3809365	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd like to check it out. My apologies	 but
let's head to the Companio.
3809317	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Oh	 you're back! Impeccable timin'!
3809319	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I've been startin' to feel somethin' real
sinister from beyond Nightmare's Gateway.
3809320	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	If things keep goin' like this	 I reckon
we're headed for a whole heap of trouble...
3809372	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... So my fears were not unfounded.
3700771	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 you want us to defeat whatever is on
the other side then?
3809321	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Oh	 I'm so glad we're on the same page!
3809322	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	There'll be a marvelous reward awaitin' your
return... if you succeed!
3809323	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Always meaning business	 I see. There is
much to be gained	 but not without risk.
What should we do	 Wonder?
3809325	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Great! I just knew you'd say yes!
3809371	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then we have a deal. Let us prepare	 and
then crack open this Nightmare's Gateway.
3809346	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nd Club Member	Hey	 are you interested in joining the
band club?
3809347	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nd Club Member	Yeah	 I am.|Not right now	 sorry...
3809333	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nd Club Member	Being in a band's the best. Nothing beats
performing with your buds	 and seeing the
crowd go wild...
3809334	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nd Club Member	If you are interested	 you've really gotta
try it. You're bound to love it!
3809348	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team Member	Oh hey	 are you interested in joining the
soccer team?
3809349	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team Member	Yeah	 I am.|Not right now	 sorry...
3809340	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team Member	Soccer's the most beloved sport in the world!
There's nothing like passing the ball at the
perfect moment and scoring a goal!
3809341	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team Member	If you do have an interest	 I urge you to
give it a shot. We welcome new members
with open arms!
3809342	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team Member	Join us as we aim for nationals!
3809366	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	So	 sugar	 how are you finding the place?
You seem like you're having fun here.
3809368	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Glad to hear it	 glad to hear it! Can't be
much of a merchant without satisfied
customers	 now	 can I!?
3809369	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Come visit as much as you like	 whenever you
like! You're always welcome here!
3809370	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Every so often	 we'll get something extra
special in stock at the shop here	 so look
forward to that!
3820001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... It doesn't seem as though this door
is going to open. Let's look around a little
more and see what we can find	 Wonder.
3820002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good work	 Wonder. Keep it up.
3820003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we'll need a key to open it up...
Let's search the area	 shall we?
3820004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm...? I think that might have changed
something...
3820007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that this door still won't open...
3820008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... Perhaps there is something that we
still need to do	 Wonder.
3820009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are we perhaps forgetting something	 Wonder?
3820010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense something on the other side of
that gate...
3820011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 did you hear that...? I think that's
unlocked it	 Wonder.
3820012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that we cannot use the camera...
3820013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that we cannot use the camera...
3820014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that we cannot use the camera...
3820015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that we cannot use the camera...
3820016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need flint in order to light the flame.
I wonder where we could find some...
3820017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is there not something else that we need
to do right now?
3820018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait. Let's defeat the shadow near the
treasure chest before we open it.
3820019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would seem that was the wrong order...
Perhaps you could use your skills of
perception to uncover a hint.
3820101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 there's another camera here...
3820102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's this...? Might it have something to do
with that camera...?
3820103	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 it seems that we can use this camera.
3820104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This camera appears to be slightly
different.
3820105	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seems to be a row of torches here...
3820106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's something slightly different about
this torch...
3820107	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a peculiarly-shaped device...
3820108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've spotted another camera.
3820109	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cameras here	 too? There's something off
about this.
3820110	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But it's not movin'... Is it broken?
3820111	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa-like Voice	Long	 long ago... Four self-proclaimed "true"
shinobi challenged the great
Castle Miyazawa.
3820112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What... Is that Miyazawa's voice?
3820113	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa-like Voice	Brave samurai and countless automata await
them! Few will return alive!
3820114	Miya<#000000	z	#FFFFFF>awa-like Voice	With trained eyes and skills	 can the shinobi
conquer the castle and reclaim their honor?
3820114b	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa-like Voice	A new masterpiece written	 directed	 and
starring Hiromu Miyazawa	 in theaters now!
3820115	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Four shinobi? Does that mean... us?
3820116	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Probably	 yeah. Which would mean that
Castle Miyazawa is...
3820117	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed... We've seen palaces take different
forms	 but this one sounds like a movie pitch.
3820117b	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So it's Miyazawa's idea for a movie	 then.
He did say something about a script...
3820117c	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 does that mean we have to actually
follow his script to go through the palace!?
3820117d	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is a significant possibility. If this
is a movie... The <color=#FF423F>cameras</color> may be key.
3820118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 it isn't usable right now.
Shall we investigate the area first?
3820119	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No getting through here. There's a big box in
the way.
3820120	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 look over there! There's something
by the camera.
3820121	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What is that thing? Doesn't look like it's
just for decoration...
3820122	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	The shinobi foolishly entered Miyazawa Castle
still proclaiming their own truth...
3820123	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Dun dun dun! Hunt for the Shinobi:
the Impregnable Automata Fortress!
3820124	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that supposed to be a movie title? It's...
Uh	 I'm not sure about that one	 man...
3820125	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Soon	 the first automata block their path.
3820126	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Can they use their <color=#FF423F>powers of transformation</color>
and observation to escape? Or are they stupid?
3820126b	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Nothing but cheap shots from this guy...
I'm not falling for it.
3820127	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I get what you mean	 but the problem is	 what
do we actually do now?
3820129	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very sharp	 Wonder. I was thinking about that
part myself.
3820129b	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That thing Closer spotted may be a hint. We
should at least take a closer look.
3820130	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is that what he meant by transformation?
I guess it changed shape	 but come on.
3820130b	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Usually "powers of transformation" would mean
transforming yourself	 right?
3820131	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right! He's really phoning this shit in	
ain't he?
3820132	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The gate's not opening... Is it locked or
somethin'?
3820133	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Look	 there's a camera over there	 too.
It looks different from the others.
3820134	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Having passed the first trial	 the shinobi
were faced with a second trial!
3820135	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Only the shinobi's Eyes of Truth technique
had any hope of overcoming this automata...
3820135b	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Delinquent brats who rely only on brute force
shall weep! For they are powerless!
3820136	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ugh... I know he's trying to get to me	 but
it still pisses me off!
3820137	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He mentioned Eyes of Truth... You think that
has anything to do with that camera?
3820139	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Miyazawa does seem to have a strong attachment
to film and cameras.
3820139b	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not clear what he means by Eyes of Truth	
but we can go ahead and test some theories.
3820140	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The gate's clear now! We can keep going!
3820140b	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's great and all	 but... is this really
a ninja technique?
3820141	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right!? Ninja arts	 Eyes of Truth	 all this
crap is just a way to stretch his
shoddy premise...
3820142	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? It's a dead end?
3820143	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's another camera. Which must mean...
3820144	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Battered and bruised	 the shinobi forged on	
only to find themselves facing a new trial...
3820145	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I knew it!
3820146	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	The way was blocked by an <color=#FF423F>ancient seal</color>! Will
this be the end for our little miscreants!?
3820147	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A seal? Whatever that means	 I'm sure it'll
have to do with cameras again.
3820149	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed... Time for more trial and error	 then.
Good luck	 Wonder.
3820150	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay	 what kind of "seal" opens just by
pointing a camera at it?
3820150b	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Maybe this is supposed to be ninjutsu	 too?
I think I'm losing the plot now	 though...
3820151	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Don't worry	 Closer. It's probably better not
to think about it too much.
3820152	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Now he's blocking the way with bales of rice?
Man	 these'll be a pain to move...
3820154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's been consistent so far	 but really	 how
are we supposed to apply a camera here?
3820155	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	My cunning little burglars	 I see you've made
it into the heart of my fortress...
3820156	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	For delinquent children you've done well...
However! You will go no further!
3820157	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	For this trial can only be surmounted by the
demonic art of the <color=#FF423F>Cursed Eye of Time</color>!
3820158	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cursed Eye of Time	 huh? And it's a "demonic
art" this time?
3820159	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sounds like it. Guess he realized the "ninja
techniques" thing wasn't gonna cut it this time?
3820160	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I know you all have critiques to make	 but
we're not here to workshop Miyazawa's script.
3820160b	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right now we need to figure out what this
Cursed Eye of Time really is.
3820160c	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right. I guess we should go check
out the camera.
3820161	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So it... rewinds time? Wow	 these cameras can
really do anything...
3820161b	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No kidding. Maybe the next one'll transport
us to another dimension?
3820161c	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're in an alternate dimension right now	
you know...
3820162	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh!
3820163	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Another camera... But we can't get to it	
huh.
3820164	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We'll have to do something about the fence.
Maybe those lantern things do something?
3820165	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Dun dun dun... Our cocky little brats refused
to learn their lesson and kept going...
3820166	Miyaza<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a's voice	To proceed	 they will need to light the
lanterns in the <color=#FF423F>proper order</color>... However!
3820166b	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	They will never be able to discern the true
pattern! Struggle and despair! Ahahaha!
3820167	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 I think he's breaking character now...
3820167b	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He didn't even mention ninjas once
this time.
3820169	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agreed. But even if his script is a joke	
his automata are not...
3820169b	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should examine this place carefully. We may
find some hint about the pattern we need.
3820170	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Aw yeah	 we got it! Miyazawa said it was
impossible	 but that wasn't so bad!
3820171	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. Well done	 team.
3820172	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	What!? How could they complete this trial so
easily? My whole script is ruined now!
3820173	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yazawa's voice	Don't think this means you've won	 brats!
The story's not over yet!
3820174	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's he got up his sleeve this time?
3820175	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Who knows... Whatever it is	 it doesn't
change what we've gotta do	 right?
3820175c	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. Still though... That last line from him
sure was a clich√© villain quip	 huh.
3820175d	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This "movie" has a D-list ham for a lead
actor on top of a garbage script... What a
hack job.
3820176	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I really must agree...
3820200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 is that a map of the palace?
3820202	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Seems we're in the Third Bailey from the
looks of it.
3820204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In order to infiltrate the palace	 it is
crucial that we grasp its layout. Be sure
to check the map as we proceed.
3820300	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah	 there's another map!
3820302	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Looks like we're in the Second Bailey...
Hey	 wait a sec	 this place's even bigger than
the Third Bailey!
3820304	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Guess we've still got a long road ahead of
us... Well	 no use complaining. Let's keep
moving!
3820400	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I spy a map! Let's see here...
3820402	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This castle seems rather
labyrinthine...
3820404	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's proceed carefully so we don't get lost.
3820500	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 found another map.
3820502	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Jeez	 does it really need all these
passageways!? And it looks like there's
obstacles round every corner...!
3820504	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed	 it does seem dangerous	 but I sense
that we are getting closer to the Treasure.
We have made good progress.
3820600	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This must be the final map... The Treasure is
within our grasp.
3820602	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 but this area seems like it's gonna
be a real pain to get through. Looks like
there's even more obstacles...
3820604	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This place has a different vibe to the rest
of the castle	 so this has to be the final
stretch. Let's do this!
3880001	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If I may speak	 you appear ready to
face a trial.
3880002	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Here	 you may see what I have prepared.
3881001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 it's time.
3881002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like you've found a real prize!
3881003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Success!
3881004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This Shadow can't support the Palace ruler
anymore...
3881005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's have it assist us now!
3881006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we've been sent somewhere
outside Mementos...
3881007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense a large number of Shadows here.
Let's proceed with caution.
3881008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 wait. I sense intense malice here.
Be careful.
3881009	Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow Lord	So you're the little rats who snuck into my
castle. Have you come for my head?
3881010	Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow Lord	Your quest is futile! For I am protected
by the<color=#FF423F>loyalty</color> of my vassals...
3881011	Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow Lord	If you have any sense at all	 you'll turn
tail and flee this place!
3881012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Much as I hate to grant credence to enemy
taunts	 what he said is true.
3881013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would be unwise to challenge him now.
3881014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But we're not without recourse! The Shadow
himself gave us the hint we need.
3881015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He said that the loyalty of his vassals is
protecting him.
3881016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps if we defeat those vassals	
<color=#FF423F>something will change</color> here.
3881017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Loyal vassals...
3881018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How about we start by looking for Shadows
that fit that description?
3881019	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Soldier	I am an honorable warrior! I will not yield
to the likes of you!
3881020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 we've removed that Shadow's protection
from the lord shadow.
3881021	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Soldier	Let me out! Damn you! I'll win the next
fight. Just you wait!
3881022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Say	 Wonder	 have you noticed that we can
steal these Shadows' powers?
3881023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They seem to have a variety of abilities.
They may be quite useful if we're smart
with them.
3881024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another enemy! Let's take it out!
3881025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's use this power.
3881026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ugh... They must have sealed the doors to
prevent us from stealing more of their power.
3881027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We won't be able to fight any more of
the vassal Shadows...
3881028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But...
3881029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With the powers we've already taken	 maybe
we're prepared to face <color=#FF423F>his lordship</color>.
3881030	Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow Lord	Come and challenge me if you dare	 cowards!
3881031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are we going to fight this <color=#FF423F>Shadow</color>?
3881032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The underlings are already captured	 so we
can't fight the them anymore.
3881033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are Shadows lurking around here
somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
3881034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a strong one	 but if we can fight and
take out its underlings	 we'll stand a chance!
3881035	Choices	Got it.|Let's find them.
3891000	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Excuse me.
3891001	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have been sent to inform you that the time
has come for you to make a deal.
3891020	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	*chuckle* I look forward to your next visit.
3891021	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You can obtain new power...
3891040	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Use its power well...
3891041	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	May we meet again soon.
3891050	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't go in here now it seems.
3891060	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... We can't go in here. Let's try again
another time.

the morning. Sorry to pester you first thing	
but I have something to report.
3890080	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems your desire to know takes
precedence over social niceties.
3890081	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 perhaps that's a good sign. Your
Persona has only just awakened	 after all.

attendance at school is drawing closer	 yes?
3900036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Given your responsibilities as a student	 I

other better.

the comestible hour	 but...

within you.
3800477	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You may deliver this world from fading hope
to salvation... Or perhaps to devastation
instead.

3900044	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That being said	 the state of your room
leaves much to be desired.

nurturing hope	 I would prefer it have a
splash of color...

bit since I was your age.

3890008	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Though scientifically	 the principle applies
to various kinds of produce.
3900112	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Yes	 well done. The answer is apple.
3900113	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	One bad apple spoils the whole barrel	 as
the old saying goes.
3900115	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	These days	 we use bad apple to refer to a
person in a group who causes problems
for the others.
3900116	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Aaand no one is listening.
3900117	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	It might remind one of the recent "Menacing"
incidents. We might think of these as bad
apples who've fallen from the wagon...
3900118	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	But people are more complex than you may
think. I'm sure even Menaces had extenuating
circumstances that led them astray.
3900119	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What am I saying...? Okay class	 open your
textbooks to where we left off last week.
3900120	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rge Male Student	Anyway	 it's lunchtime now.
3900121	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>llow Girl	Ugh	 we still have more classes after this.
Definitely the work of a Menace.
3900123	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What happened yesterday was pretty scary	
wasn't it?
3890092	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're kidding	 right? It wasn't exactly
something you could easily miss...
3890093	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Pretty crazy	 right? I guess they just like
living on the wild side...
3900125	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I mean	 what kind of person rides their bike
through a train car?
3900126	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By the time the station attendants showed
up	 the rider was already gone.
3800537	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And the person they hit doesn't seem to be
doing too great either.
3900127	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wonder if they'll be condemned as
a Menace.
3900129	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You haven't heard of <color=#FF423F>Magatsukami's</color>
<color=#FF423F>Divine Justice</color>?
3890094	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Magatsukami's the one who runs Divine
Justice	 a site that compiles videos of people
who've been causing trouble in the area.
3890096	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course	 that's not their real name.
3890097	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's the name of a website that compiles
videos of people who've been seen causing
trouble throughout town.
3890098	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The person who runs the site is called
Magatsukami. 'Course that's not their
actual name.
3890012	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Apparently	 if you're condemned by
Magatsukami	 you're officially named
a Menace.
3890013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But honestly	 I only scroll through the site
to kill time so I don't really know much
about it.
3800541	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's no criminal intent or any hard
evidence	 so there's not much the police
can do about it.
3800542	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Or... they're just unwilling to make a move.
3890014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But it seems like Divine Justice's getting
really popular.
3890015	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's got more subscribers than a B-list
celebrity's channels. Here	 let me pull
it up...
3900137	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on...
3900138	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME1}-kun	 there's something I've
been meaning to ask you... How is it you
ended up in Shibuya yesterday?
3900140	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	One minute you were on the train... and then
you just disappeared.
3900141	K<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nd Female Student	Motoha! Let's go grab lu‚Äî ...Oh?
3900142	K<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nd Female Student	We met this morning! You're in the same
class as Motoha?
3900143	Kind Female S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	Thank you again for finding my train pass.
3800543	K<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nd Female Student	I'm <color=#FF423F>Tomoko Noge</color> from Class D. Motoha and I
are best friends! Nice to meet you!
3900144	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 hang on. Since when do you two know
each other?
3800545	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	He really helped me out of a jam this
morning. Wait	 am I... interrupting something?
3800546	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nope	 not at all!
3900145	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We're still getting lunch	 right? It's gonna
get crowded if we don't hurry.
3900146	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh crap	 it's already that late?
3900147	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ugh	 we're really late. It's probably a
circus in there by now.
3800547	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable	
{NAME1}...
3809373	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's go	 Tomoko.
3900151	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah...
3900152	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We keep running into each other today	 huh?
3900153	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Motoha was worried her favorite bread would
sell out	 so she went ahead to the
school store.
3900154	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Even though she brought lunch from home.
Kinda reminds me of how she used to be before
she stopped playing.
3900157	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Back in the day	 Motoha and I would play
baseball together	 but she ended up
quitting the team.
3900165	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's been pretty down ever since... but
lately	 she seems to be getting more upbeat	
which is a big relief.
3900166	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 and I bet I know why! Maybe it's because
she sits near you in class!
3900168	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You're pretty modest	 huh? You should be
more confident in yourself! You did save
my skin this morning after all.
3900169	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No... I haven't done anything special. All I
can do is try and be there for her...
3800548	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 sorry. I shouldn't be holding you up.
3800549	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You're headed to lunch now too	 right?
Where do you usually eat?
3900159	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The roof...? So that's why you were heading
for the stairs.
3900160	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe. Big fan of the private	 fine
dining experience?
3900162	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I guess some of my classmates are like
that too.
3900163	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway	 I should go meet up with Motoha.
See you later!
3900172	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Over here.
3900173	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've come to answer your questions
as promised.
3900174	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What you witnessed yesterday... Mementos
and Shadows...
3890017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This isn't something for the faint of heart.
Are you ready?
3900175	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ahoom. Very well then... The other world
you visited is called "Mementos."
3900176	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Mementos is an embodiment of the collective
human unconscious	 manifested as
physical space.
3890019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you imagine the real world as one side of
a coin	 Mementos exists in perfect parallel
on the opposite side.
3800560	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Mementos is filled with the consciousness
of various humans	 so it would be apropos for
you to consider it a cognitive realm.
3900178	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Think of it as a place constructed from the
thoughts and feelings people hold toward
their world.
3900179	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is a dark world. Bleak	 and malignant.
A place that light itself cannot reach.
3890099	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is to say	 at present	 people cannot
even imagine the existence of hope in
their world.
3890100	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And I am sure you know why	 do you not?
3890101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. You are quite the sharp one. Now	
to continue...
3900186	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Metaverse contains two distinct species
of Shadows.
3900187	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The first	 enemies that attack with no rhyme
or reason.
3800562	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These Shadows are not human	 but monsters
formed from warped desire.
3800563	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The second	 Shadows that are born from the
darkness of a human's heart in the
real world.
3800564	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A person's true nature concealed within their
heart	 the embodiment of their desires... To
put it differently	 another self.
3800571	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 you should already be aware of this.
3800572	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Because you awakened your Shadow as
a Persona.
3800573	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 not just anyone can control what
lies inside their heart.
3800574	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If by some reason one's desires become
corrupted	 their Shadow will run amok.
3800575	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In the real world that person becomes
willing to hurt others with reckless abandon.
3800576	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In my estimation	 the Shadow of someone from
the real world is the central cause of the
problem we are facing now.
3800577	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That person has been using the Metaverse as
a means to exploit the desires of others.
And I am intent on catching them.
3800579	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course it is not something one might
accept so easily	 but you have witnessed it
for yourself.
3800580	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows	 the Metaverse	 and what becomes of
those people who've lost all desire.
3800581	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To make matters worse	 when a human's
Shadow goes out of control...
3800582	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...their warped desire can influence the
Shadows around them.
3800583	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	While it may be inadvertent	 the triggering
of those Shadows...
3800653	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...stands as one cause for the loss of hope
seen across the real world.
3800655	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 much about the Metaverse still
eludes me. Therefore	 it is of critical
importance we learn more about it.
3800656	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I hate to throw so much at you at once	 but
I would like to move on to discussing the
job I have for you.
3890102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Correct. I wish to employ your abilities	
so to speak.
3890103	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That I did. Simply put	 I wish to employ
your abilities.
3900189	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I want you to join me	 and become a
<color=#FF423F>Phantom Thief</color>.
3798835	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As to what we will be stealing	 I am sure
you can already guess.
3890104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I believe this will provide you the chance
to experience the full range of your newly
awakened Persona's abilities as well.
3890106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	One cannot choose the time that opportunity
comes knocking. Though I can understand
your hesitation.
3890107	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Average? Are you mad?
3890108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No. It must be the influence of this world's
fading desire talking.
3900193	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us leave it here for today.
3798836	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps it will be more efficient to explain
further once I've introduced our target.
3900194	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I will be waiting for you in Shibuya
after school.
3900195	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For you humans to recover what's been taken
from you	 we must steal it back.
3900196	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To that end	 we'll begin preparations later.
See you soon.
3989911	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*screech*
3890073	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you think you're doing!? You ruined
my takeoff!
3900074	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh forget it	 we can continue this later!
3900210	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry	 {NAME1}-kun! I was so deep in
thought I wasn't looking where I was going.
3900211	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It actually had something to do with you...
3900213	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh right! Here's your phone. It looks like
it wasn't scratched or anything	 but...
3900214	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait. That icon...
3900215	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Called Tanemura	Let's save the diving catches for outside	
shall we?
3900216	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 Riko-senpai. Sorry about that. I just
didn't want his phone to break	 so I...
3900217	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Looks like you'd still make the starting
lineup even now.
3900218	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's ancient history.
3900223	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're the one from the other day.
3900225	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It was nothing	 really. But...
3900226	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're the one who had trouble getting
through the hallway yesterday	 right? But...
3900227	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It seems like there's something different
about you. No	 it's probably just
in my head...
3900219	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Anyway	 fifth period's about to start. Don't be late	 you two.
3900202	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Earth to {NAME1}-kun.
3900220	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Fifth period is in the lab. If we don't leave now	 we're totally screwed.
3900231	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It was on {NAME1}-kun's phone too. This weird app that keeps reappearing no matter how many times I delete it...
3900233	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I asked around	 but no one has any idea what I'm talking about.
3900234	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So why does {NAME1}-kun have the exact same app on his phone?
3890024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Plus he disappeared into thin air while on the train yesterday! Something seems off about him...
3900235	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Tomoko	 don't you have club today?
3900236	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The club room's closed for maintenance	 so we have it off. Thought it'd be nice to walk home together!
3900238	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sure!
3900250	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So you've come after all.
3900254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I am somewhat fatigued. Your half empty bag makes for a comfortable reprieve.
3890111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just act natural. Standing out too much will alert our target.
3900253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All in good time. Now look over there.
3900257	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is our target. <color=#FF423F>Takeyuki Kiuchi</color>.
3890026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He works for a company in Tokyo.
3900260	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	People have taken to calling him the "Subway Slammer."
3900259	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He targets women he thinks won't fight back	 and intentionally bodychecks them.
3890065	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	His way of satisfying a certain desire. A most repellent kind of human.
3900204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I feel the same.
3900262	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To him	 it's just an ordinary habit. But the root cause lies in the Metaverse.
3900264	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm sure you can figure out why.
3890113	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. Although...
3890114	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have yet to confirm the state of his Shadow for myself	 so it is just conjecture at this point.
3890115	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	At a glance	 this sort of behavior might not seem all that threatening to some.
3890116	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For that reason	 the police refuse to take
action. Simply claiming it was an "accident"
is enough for them to drop the issue.
3890117	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the victims are left with no recourse but to give up	 as their faith in the world erodes away.
3890118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To be precise	 Kiuchi's self-serving misdeeds are causing his victims to lose hope.
3890120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It won't work. If his Shadow is running loose	 then...
3890121	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...there's no way for us to stop his actions in the real world	 and no chance he'll listen to reason.
3890122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The irony is	 as long as he continues to believe there's nothing wrong with his behavior...
3890123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...he will never change	 and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
3890124	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we were to confront him here	 there is a possibility that he'll fly into a rage and endanger everyone in the vicinity.
3890125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 in the worst case...
3890127	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man Glued to Her Phone	Ah!
3890128	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man Glued to Her Phone	Uh...
3900206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done.
3890129	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fending off selfish desire with righteous
indignation. You truly have awakened.
3900276	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch! But now he's seen us. We should get out of here.
3900277	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Aaah!
3890030	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n	Are you okay!?
3890130	O<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>her Woman	The baby! Oh dear god!
3890131	O<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>her Man	I think... I think it's too late...
3890133	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What are you talking about?
3890134	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears you're seeing things... Perhaps you're still exhausted from yesterday's excitement.
3900207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should get away from here for now. Kiuchi is surely on his guard.
3900208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us make our way to the station square	 where we exited Mementos last time.
3900279	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that {NAME1}-kun? What's he doing here?
3900280	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It looked like he was talking to that guy over...
3900281	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He...
3900282	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sooorry! Apparently the ticket gate didn't like my train pass	 so I got held up at the gate.
3900283	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Is something wrong?
3900284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nope	 all good! Wanna hit the underground mall?
3900293	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh	 what are you talking about?
3900300	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This seems like a good spot for now.
3890135	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's get back on track. You understand the
point I was making	 yes? It won't be possible
to stop Kiuchi from the real world.
3890136	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I said before	 I doubt the police are
going to be of any help either.
3890137	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Their desires are being siphoned just like
everyone else's.
3890138	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sometimes there are problems of such
magnitude it takes the whole world working
together to reach a solution.
3890139	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In our current state	 even people's basic
human desires are evaporating.
We are in crisis.
3890141	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is a way for us to stop it.
3890142	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We find Kiuchi's Shadow in the Metaverse
and steal a certain precious item from it	
thereby becoming Phantom Thieves.
3890144	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I refer to such items as <color=#FF423F>Treasure</color>.
But before we get into that...
3890145	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As you are aware	 the Metaverse is filled
with Shadows and other dangers
yet unknown to us.
3890146	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here's what I need you to understand
going forward.
3890147	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By taking on this job together	 you and I
will become business partners.
3890148	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you truly understand what it means to be
a Phantom Thief?
3890149	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What say you?
3890151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 that's to be expected.
3890152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Until yesterday you were an ordinary high
schooler	 and here I am asking you to take on
a job that will put your life at risk.
3890153	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I want you to remember this.
3890154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All those who've been abused by the
egocentric actions of people like Kiuchi
continue to lose hope every day.
3890155	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The worst outcome being that abuse drives them to take their own lives.
3900308	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But you... You awakened your Persona through your unquenchable thirst for life.
3890033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And seeing as Shadows can only be defeated by Personas...
3890156	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You are the only one who can take action against them.
3890158	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If fiends like Kiuchi are pushing people to the brink of despair...
3890160	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...then you may have the power to lead them back to light.
3900076	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I will tell you after you become a Phantom Thief.
3900090	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All I can say for now is	 I strongly believe humans should embrace their desires.
3900110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But perhaps I am pushing this on you.
3900111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	After all	 choice is another precious human desire we ought to embrace.
3890010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Forget my words and take some time now to think it over for yourself.
3900130	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why not take a stroll around <color=#FF423F>Central Street</color>
to clear your mind?
3900131	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If it behooves you	 you might consider procuring restorative healing goods vital to our mission while you're there.
3900132	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I will await your answer from here. If you decide to take on the job	 do give a shout.
3900330	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So you've returned. Might I take that to mean you wish to accept my offer?
3900340	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your answer	 if you please.
3900335	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's what I've been longing to hear.
3900336	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us head to Mementos straight away.
I trust you have your <color=#FF423F>Metaverse Navigator</color>
handy?
3900338	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The eye-shaped icon on your phone.
3900345	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Metaverse Navigator. Give it a tap.
3900339	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Understood. I will wait here until you've decided.
3890035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Metaverse Navigator. Give it a tap.
3900341	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your answer	 if you please.
3900343	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well? Are you feeling prepared?
3900350	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now our work has officially begun. From here
on we'll need to establish <color=#FF423F>code names</color>
for ourselves.
3900353	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I stated previously	 Mementos is the collective unconscious of the masses.
3900356	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we use our real names	 it might have an effect on their cognition...
3900357	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...and risk our identities being discovered.
3900135	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 we should use code names while working	 to keep our real identities secret.
3890547	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In any case	 don't you find the thought of having a code name rather debonair?
3711617	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What!? You don't understand "debonair"?
3711618	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's‚Äî Well	 it means	 um... "spiffy and happening"!
3890036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As for your code name	 since I find you to be a marvel beyond my own imagining	 we shall call you...
3900358	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder.
3900360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A keen intuition is necessary for this kind of thing. And my intuition tells me that you should be called Wonder.
3900362	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And I would like you to refer to me as Cattle.
3900364	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not sure myself	 but this is another intuition that I have. I shall henceforth be known as Cattle.
3900369	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I will share the details of the job as we make our way	 including the Treasure I mentioned earlier.
3900366	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 Wonder	 let's move.
3900367	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Argh! To think I didn't take notice of the enemy's approach!
3900368	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These Shadows must be under the influence of Kiuchi's warped desire.
3711619	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder! Strike them down!
3895956	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No need for combat instructions anymore	 correct? Cut your way through them one by one!
3901300	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 that's sorted. Let's make quick work of the rest.
3901301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Reinforcements!?
3901302	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch	 now we're surrounded. This is bad!
3901310	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd really like to	 but our way out is blocked!
3901311	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ngh! We'll have to fight our way out.
3901312	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll deal with the Shadows behind us. You cut your way through!
3901313	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder!
3901314	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Who is that?
3901320	Joker	Follow my lead!
3901321	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 I expected you to come to that conclusion.
3901322	Joker	Resist it...
3900304	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He disappeared... What just happened?
3900306	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyway	 let's get moving	 Wonder.
3900307	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We may have cleared out the enemies	 but we shouldn't dawdle in a place like this.
3900309	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You have been summoned.
3900310	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please come with me.
3900370	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have brought {NAME1} as requested.
3900372	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In the real world	 you are on your way home from school	 hence your appearance.
3900374	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	So	 you have made another deeply intriguing decision.
3900376	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Master informed you before about
<color=#FF423F>strengthening your desire to ward off ruin</color>.
3890037	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your decision to enter the Metaverse tells me you possess the will to do just that.
3900399	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	As such	 we may offer you our support.
3900414	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Merope	 I believe there was something you wanted to try. Go ahead.
3900385	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The beings you have just witnessed are
<color=#FF423F>cognitive forms</color>.
3900387	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yes. They are manifestations I constructed
from cognitions buried deep inside
your heart.
3900391	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Correct. They are manifestations I have
constructed from cognitions buried deep
inside your heart.
3900407	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Whether they are persons you know closely	
familiar faces you've seen in passing...
3900408	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...or those of whom you have no memory	 but
came into contact with unwittingly...
3900409	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That I do not know.
3890162	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yet what is certain is that you are all
linked by the possession of strong desires.
3900388	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	They continue to embrace said desires	
or perhaps	 they once did.
3900389	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your cognitions reflect these persons at the
time they embraced desire most intensely
in varied forms.
3890163	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Even if you do not recognize them at present	
embracers of desire are drawn
to one another.
3890164	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Sooner or later	 you will certainly come
to know them.
3890165	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And in your world of fading desires	 they
will sparkle like brilliant gemstones...
3890166	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...like idols.
3900400	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Furthermore	 they can employ the power
of Persona Duo.
3900393	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A Duo	 or pair	 in this case refers to your
Persona's second.
3900394	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Envision it as two singers performing
together in a duet.
3900395	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Correct. A Duo	 or pair	 in this case refers
to your Persona's second.
3900396	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Envision it as two singers performing
together in a duet.
3900401	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Like a duo of idols in concert	 these
cognitive forms will act as your backup in battle.
3900402	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We shall call them <color=#FF423F>Phantom Idols</color>!
3900397	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The Phantom Idols find inspiration from
your own Persona.
3900398	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have formed this prototype out of Shadows
from Mementos and the desires of those
persons stored in your cognition.
3890041	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	To act as Phantom Thieves	 they will require
code names of their own.
3890042	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Consequently	 please forgive my boldness	
as I designate names for each of them.
3890044	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hehe. I haven't felt such a sense of
accomplishment as I do this moment.
3890045	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I shall endeavor to provide you with even
greater support.
3900492	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh	 there is one more thing I must inform
you of.
3710741	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Housed within your psyche there exists not
just one personality‚Äîor Persona‚Äîbut multiple.
3890022	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As your perceptions materialize	 they'll take
root in your heart. These faint flickers you
feel emerging are potential Personas.
3890023	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Harness Phantom Idols	 their Persona Duos	
and everything else at your disposal...
3900221	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...and you may yet escape the coming ruin.
3900256	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...?
3900261	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am unaware of such a person	 but...
3900265	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Heheh. Just as I thought.
3900266	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Forgive me. There are still many mysteries
in this world... and perhaps some distortions
as well.
3900267	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Irregularities formed from the endless
intermingling of consciousness... The extent
of which we can never know.
3900268	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If the matter intrigues you	 I would suggest
taking action. It will likely prove
another way to strengthen your desire.
3900269	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And I	 as your concierge	 will continue to
offer you the fullest extent of my support.
3900405	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	That concludes our time here for now.
3900406	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Should you require the strength of the
Phantom Idols	 call upon me from the depths
of your heart.
3900410	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You went blank for a moment there. Something
the matter?
3890168	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're not making any sense...
3890169	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Whatever utterance	 it seems to be beyond my
comprehension. Or perhaps you intended to
flout the conventions of communication?
3890170	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your code name is "Wonder." Mine is "Cattle."
3890062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Was that... relevant to something?
3900412	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You must be fatigued.
3900413	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Between school and battling those shadows	
you've certainly overdone it.
3900415	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In that case	 I know just the thing.
3900416	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Brace yourself...
3900422	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You	 Wonder	 are about to be the first human
to ever witness this.
3900418	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Transform!
3900419	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Phew. This will do.
3900421	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I mentioned that Mementos contains the
cognitions of the masses	 yes?
3900423	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well I just made use of someone's cognition
about "animals transforming into vehicles."
3900311	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why such a thought is abundant here...
I do not know.
3890046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now get in! I'll need you to be the driver.
3900425	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Start the engine and step on the gas. Then
use the wheel to steer.
3900426	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll keep an eye out and take action if
need be.
3900427	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent. Now let's get to work.
3890068	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First	 let's head deeper into Mementos.
I will alert you as we approach
our destination.
3900430	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows... But our destination is just ahead.
We're going to have to fight them.
3900431	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There aren't as many as before	 but don't
drop your guard. Here they come!
3900435	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A new enemy!?
3900437	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You know what that is? Then I trust you.
Let's wipe out those enemies.
3900450	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 that's sorted.
3900451	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	About that	 um... Phantom Rival	 was it?
3900453	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They seem to have an uncompromising air
about them... Well	 no matter.
3900454	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Cognitive forms with Persona-like power...
I never could have imagined such a
thing exists.
3900455	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll let you manage these um	 Phantom Idols	
as you put it.
3900456	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's hurry onward.
3900460	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A boy you're curious about?
3900461	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah...
3900462	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oooh	 who is it? Someone from school?
3900463	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well...
3900464	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 sweet	 sweet Tomoko. I can read you
like a book. To think you have eyes for more
than just baseball!
3900466	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay	 listen	 it's not that I like him or
anything! I'm just a little curious is all.
3900467	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's get some food and you can tell me
all about it.
3900468	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Hm?
3900469	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	That short-haired girl...
3900470	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 according to my intelligence	 this
is the spot.
3900472	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As a native to the Metaverse	 I have a
certain level of understanding about
its structure.
3900474	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can hear	 just barely	 the voice at the
heart of the collective unconscious.
3900476	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You probably can't hear it yourself	 but I
use it to gather information on
the Metaverse.
3900477	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's certainly around her‚Äî Hm?
3890048	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no mistake. Kiuchi's <color=#FF423F>Palace</color>
is just ahead.
3900480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Within the vast bounds of Mementos exist locations manifested from the warped desires of certain individuals.
3900481	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Like a fortress from which the Shadow of an unscrupulous human can steal other's desires.
3900483	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here Kiuchi rules as the castle's king	 and enemy Shadows are his loyal subjects.
3900487	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This Palace is also the site of our first job.
3900488	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Come along	 Wonder!
3900490	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So this is Kiuchi's Palace	 huh? Looks a lot more like a baseball stadium to me.
3901323	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose Kiuchi has a vivid imagination.
3900495	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like we won't be getting in through the front door.
3900497	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's investigate the surrounding area.
3900500	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm?
3890049	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like we could get in through that duct.
3890171	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hehe	 I agree.
3890157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It will leave no trace of our intrusion	 in addition to being quite stylish.
3890172	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Taking an alternative entrance feels much more suited to us Phantom Thieves.
3890173	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 we'll have to put a pause on that plan for the moment...
3900506	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sorry to disappoint you	 but I am unable to fly in the Metaverse.
3890159	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Besides	 I would stand no chance against enemy Shadows as an owl.
3900509	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And of course	 this form has a much more stylish	 Phantom Thief feel to it	 don't you agree?
3900507	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think I know of a way in.
3900508	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Simply locating Kiuchi's Palace is good enough for today.
3890050	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's return to the real world. We can discuss our next steps there.
3890177	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We shouldn't stay here.
3890051	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's‚Äî
3900520	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're back.
3900521	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 I'd like to coordinate our plan
for infiltration. Do you have a <color=#FF423F>workbench</color>
we can make use of?
3900526	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have some crafting expertise to share with you.
3900524	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To enter the Palace through unconventional
means	 we'll need to construct some special
instruments I like to call...
3900525	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...infiltration tools.
3900527	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But we'll need a workbench to make them...
which I'll assume you don't have	 based on
your expression.
3890053	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then we'll have to procure one.
3890054	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now where would one go to pro‚Äì
3900529	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Voice	Oh?
3900530	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hello again	 {NAME2}-kun.
3900531	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What are you doing milling around here?
3900533	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	A workbench? Are you planning to take up a new hobby?
3900534	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Why don't you check the secondhand shop
in <color=#FF423F>Yongen-Jaya</color>?
3900535	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	They probably sell that sort of thing.
3900536	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	{NAME2}	 have you been to Yongen before?
3900538	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You can take the Hanzomon Line straight there from Shibuya. The Hanzomon Line's right down those stairs there.
3900540	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ahh	 Yongen... That brings me back to when
my hubby and I decided to move in together.
We were both broke back then	 you see...
3900541	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And so we went to that little secondhand shop to pick out a fridge for our place...
3900542	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Now I wanted a fridge with an ice maker	 but of course he said	 "I will not be a man with a pink refrigerator!"
3900547	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But he finally gave in in the end. And just when I was thinking	 "Can I really go on living with a man like this?"
3900548	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I hate to say it but...
3900549	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is nothing in my power to stop this lady from talking. If you wouldn't mind stepping in...
3900543	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh my	 look at the time! I've got to get dinner started.
3900544	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	My hubby's coming straight home from work today	 so I better hop to it. Later	 hon!
3900550	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Thank goodness	 the torture's over.
3900551	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That "hubby" fellow she's always talking about...
3900552	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He must be a saint to stay married to her.
3900553	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 good for them I suppose.
3900545	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The secondhand shop in Yongen-Jaya	 huh? We should take the Hanzomon Line.
3900560	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>katsu Academy Boy	Hm?
3900562	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>katsu Academy Boy	That guy... It's almost like he's with someone even though he's alone...
3900563	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>katsu Academy Boy	No	 I'm probably imagining things. He looks just like a regular guy...
3900564	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What are you doing? We're headed to Yongen-Jaya	 aren't we?
3900580	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're here.
3900581	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is the first time I've been here	 but it feels familiar somehow.
3900585	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see...
3900589	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 no use ruminating on it.
3900587	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see...
3900588	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're probably right.
3900620	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>xious-Looking Girl	Hmm...
3900621	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>xious-Looking Girl	I can't seem to find anywhere that sells loose leaf tea... I'm still not used to reading Japanese either...
3900584	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 there's the secondhand shop. Let's find ourselves a workbench.
3900600	Shop Owner	Hello there! Can I help you find something?
3900602	Shop Owner	Oh	 this is just delightful!
3900603	Shop Owner	These days it's all about the internet	 isn't it?
3900604	Shop Owner	Everyone's desperate to keep up with the latest trends.
3900605	Shop Owner	All they care about is what's new	 while the old ways are forgotten more and more every day.
3900606	Shop Owner	So to see a youngster like yourself take an interest in secondhand goods...
3896054	Shop Owner	...it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.
3900607	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3900608	Shop Owner	Anyway	 you wanted a workbench	 right?
3900609	Shop Owner	Here you go! It's antique	 but should still be up to the task.
3910641	Shop Owner	This one's on the house.
3900611	Shop Owner	Don't worry about it. Just be sure to come around again	 all right?
3900612	Shop Owner	I'll have to charge next time though. Hahah.
3900613	Shop Owner	It's big	 so I'll have it delivered for ya. You live in the city	 yeah?
3900614	Shop Owner	In that case	 it should be delivered by tonight. I'll be right back with the paperwork.
3900619	Shop Owner	Here you go. Just write your name and address right there.
3900616	Shop Owner	Thanks.
3900617	Shop Owner	Okie doke	 I'll get this shipped to the address you gave. Come again!
3900618	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Okay	 workbench secured. Now let's head to your house and await its arrival.
3900630	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You were scouted? That's amazing! We should celebrate!
3900632	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Slow your roll! It still depends on how I do in the tournament next week.
3900633	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just getting invited to compete is amazing in itself! You've worked so hard for this.
3890178	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Compared to you I'm just aimlessly drifting through life. Haha.
3890179	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	......
3890180	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 Motoha... Do you ever miss baseball?
3890181	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Oh	 well um... I don't know.
3890182	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I was just thinking	 if I win the tournament...
3890183	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe we could play catch together? Just like old times?
3890184	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Not as like hardcore training or anything	 just simple fun.
3890185	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmmm...
3890186	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 sure.
3890187	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	*gasp* Hurray!
3890188	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I think the last time we got to play together we were still in grade school. Gosh	 how many years is that?
3900647	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	All right	 I've gotta win next week for sure.
3900648	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're just beaming	 aren't you	 Tomoko?
3900649	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehehe.
3900650	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 so how are things with you lately? Any good news?
3900651	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 I wouldn't call it good exactly	 but...
3900652	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	More like there's been some weird things going on that I'm interested in.
3900622	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But wait	 what about you? Who's this guy you're interested in?
3900623	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah...
3900624	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He goes to Kokatsu	 right? I could tell by your face before.
3900625	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So... who is it? Somebody I know? Is it... a full-on crush?
3900626	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sheesh	 enough with the third degree. It's... um... the person who sits... behind you...
3900627	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Behind me!?
3900628	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You mean... *gasp*
3900629	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wait	 hold on!
3890189	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's not that I like him necessarily	 I'm just interested in him as a person	 kinda...
3890190	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haha. Ah... I see. I mean this isn't a great example	 but...
3900554	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Remember in elementary school when there was that one player I really looked up to? Kinda like that?
3890191	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Uh... Oh	 yeah! Totally. Anyway	 I'm keeping an eye on him till I can find out more.
3900555	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You mean until you start getting misty eyed and your heart goes aflutter? Ah	 sweet	 sweet	 Tomoko.
3890192	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's Divine Justice... Whoa	 apparently there's another Menace.
3890193	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Whoa	 Motoha	 look! There's a post from Magatsukami. This looks serious.
3900656	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They'll be condemned tomorrow morning! We can't miss this!
3900658	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess it's stupid to look for love when the world's like this.
3890194	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sorry. Talking about the tournament's made me wanna get my body movin'!
3890195	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's cool. I've got nothing going on	 so I don't mind tagging along.
3890196	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Gosh	 when is the last time I went to the
Yongen <color=#FF423F>batting cages</color>?
3890197	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 Motoha?
3890198	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah?
3890199	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 listen...
3890200	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If going there brings back bad memories for you	 we can totally just forget about it	 okay?
3890201	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah!
3890202	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 it's {NAME1}-kun.
3890203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's wrong?
3890204	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't know! I guess 'cause of what we talked about before	 now this!
3890205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh-huh	 uh-huh	 I see... Interested in him as a "person	 are we?
3890207,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,You headed out somewhere? Or are you on your way home?
3890209,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,*gasp*
3890210,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Uh, don't worry about her. We were just about to head that way is all.
3890211,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Yeah...
3890212,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I know that place! Yongen, right?
3890213,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Oh...
3890214,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,......
3890215,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Pheew! Boy am I thirsty! I'm just gonna go grab a drink real quick...
3890216,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Wai‚Äî Huh? What!? Where are you going!?
3090218,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Don't worry about it, I'll be riiight back. Keep an eye on Tomoko for me, {NAME1}-kun, would ya?
3090219,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,W-Wait, come back!
3090220,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Motoha's taking her sweet time, huh?
3090221,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,She's probably picking out drinks for us too. She's always putting other people first...
3090222,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,You know, Motoha's always been really selfless.
3090223,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Of course it makes her a really kind person... but it also means she doesn't think enough about her own needs.
3090225,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Yeah. We were battery mates in little league.
3090226,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Unlike me, Motoha was this ultra-skilled baseball prodigy.
3090227,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Like scarily good... Pitching, hitting, defense... She was a triple threat.
3090228,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Motoha could definitely go pro. That's what
everyone said.
3090229,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Even Motoha herself wanted to. It was her dream. I used to love listening to her talk about it.
3090230,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,But... there was an incident, and she felt responsible for what happened. She ended up quitting because of it.
3090231,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Of course it wasn't actually her fault. If anything it was more of an accident, but how do I say this... She...
3090233,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Yeah...
3090234,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Quitting something she loved that much must've been really hard on her.
3090235,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,She was still depressed by the time she started high school.
3090236,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,......
3090237,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,That's why I...
3090238,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I'm gonna chase that dream for both of us!
3090239,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I'll become a baseball player, and leave a mark big enough to fill Motoha's shoes.
3090240,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,That way, maybe Motoha can love baseball again... and smile with her whole heart like she did back then.
3090241,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Someday... even if it's just for fun...
3090242,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,...I just want us to be battery mates again.
3090244,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Th-Thanks!
3090245,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,But please don't say anything to Motoha, okay? I don't wanna burden her with it.
3090246,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,This keychain's actually a present we exchanged back in little league.
3090247,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,She's a pitcher, so I got her the one shaped like a baseball, and she gave me the catcher's mitt.
3090248,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,It's really precious to me...
3090249,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I seriously panicked when I almost lost it.
3090250,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Thanks again for finding it for me, {NAME1}-kun.
3090251,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,When she quit she said she didn't deserve" to keep hers anymore	 and gave it back.
3090252	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But when the day comes that we can finally play together again	 I'm gonna give it back to her.
3090253	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sorry! I didn't mean to start talking about something so heavy. Really	 sorry	 {NAME1}-kun.
3090254	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Speaking of	 where is that girl? She still picking drinks?
3090255	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko...
3090256	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*sniffle* *exhale* Okay	 pull it together. Not in front of them...
3090257	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry for the wait! I got some for everyone!
3090258	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 we'll meet tomorrow morning on the platform for the Inogami Line!
3090259	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Talk to you then! See ya!
3090260	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	See you later.
3090261	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So... that's how kids your age mingle?
Sounded complicated.
3890217	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The workbench should be arriving tonight. We should get home as soon as possible.
3900692	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You haven't heard of Magatsukami's Divine Justice?
3900693	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's the name of a website that compiles
videos of people who've been seen causing
trouble throughout town.
3900670	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Found some interesting article	 have you?
3890218	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 caught you off-guard	 didn't I?
3090262	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Forgive me. There's much I want to learn
about you humans. It seems smartphones are
very convenient sources of information.
3090263	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyhoo	 your workbench should be arriving soon	 yes?
3890219	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What an odd thing to say. I'm already home	 aren't I?
3890220	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't see the issue here. Your parents are overseas	 are they not?
3890221	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To be clear	 I consider this place our base.
3900675	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To me	 "base" is synonymous with "home."
3890222	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now don't get upset	 I understand. Whatever trouble my staying here causes	 I promise I'll make up for it.
3900679	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Besides	 if I stay here	 I can teach you how to make infiltration tools.
3900680	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With those	 we can surely get into Kiuchi's Palace with ease.
3900686	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>livery Person's Voice	Delivery!
3900687	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like we'll need to assemble it first. Okay	 let's bring it up to the second floor.
3900689	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd prefer to keep the first floor as a place for unwinding	 so let's set it up in your room.
3900710	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 nicely done. It fits the space perfectly too.
3900712	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now I can guide you on how to make infiltration tools.
3900713	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In the future we'll craft them from supplies we've collected	 but this time we can use what I have on hand.
3900715	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Follow my instructions.
3900716	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes...
3900717	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 that part's not meant to overlap... Try to pass it through the bottom there and... Yes	 that's it.
3900720	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent work.
3900721	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can certainly infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace with this.
3900722	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll explain how to use it when the time comes.
3900723	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 here's a leftover part. Hold onto that.
3900725	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 looks like crafting infiltration tools has given you some confidence. Splendid!
3900727	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 the night's waning. It's been quite the big day of firsts for you. Good work.
3900730	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You should rest soon. I will as well.
3900750	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Apologies for the lateness of the hour.
3900751	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	It seems you have devoted yourself to strengthening your desire. Excellent.
3900753	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Do you recall what I said about seeking interaction?
3890223	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Splendid.
3890224	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You may forge hope through interaction with other embracers of desire.
3900776	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like to stress the significance of this possibility.
3900755	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	There are some in your world who cannot take
notice of their desires on their own.
3900757	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	That is why interaction with others is so meaningful.
3900758	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You likely haven't noticed yourself	 but there are people you've influenced through your interactions.
3900760	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Isn't that right	 Merope?
3900761	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Multiple in fact...
3900763	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Preamble aside	 I must relay another warning.

3900813	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ation Staff	Is she a friend of yours? Please take her away from here.
3900814	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ation Staff	We'll take care of the girl on the tracks. Leave the rest to us.
3890066	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But...
3900818	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 sure.

3900847	Vex<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>d Man	Dear lord... That's definitely the Subway Slammer. Menace in the flesh.
3900848	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ightened Woman	Menace...? So the police won't be interested	 then.
3900849	Vex<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>d Man	Hey	 it's a busy station. It happens. Kid just got unlucky...
3890275	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tsk. It seems desire is being drained left	 right and center.
3900878	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To not even bat an eyelid upon witnessing the misfortune that befalls another...
3900819	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I at least want to go with her to the hospital.
3900820	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ation Staff	That's fine. We'll let you know when we're leaving.
3900821	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm sorry...
3900822	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Can we talk?
3900823	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry	 my thoughts are a mess right now...
3900824	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...so I'm just gonna say what's on my mind.
3890243	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That guy who pushed Tomoko... You spoke to him in Shibuya the other day	 didn't you?
3890245	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh... Then I guess I misunderstood. Sorry.
3890246	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Because I know him.
3900851	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi. An ex-pro baseball player. He's... retired now.
3890247	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This girl knows Kiuchi!
3900832	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Who said that...?
3900833	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not just that	 but she can hear my voice as well!
3900834	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that an owl?
3890248	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's an owl... in your bag!?
3890249	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Which means that voice was...
3900837	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ation Staff	The ambulance is waiting outside.
3900852	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ation Staff	There's only room for one though. What would you like to do?
3900838	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm going!
3900839	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll head to school after I find out Tomoko's condition. We'll continue this later.
3900841	Station Announcement	The train on track one will resume operation momentarily.
3900842	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I know you must be worried about the girl who fell... but we should let her handle it.
3900843	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's head to school.
3890250	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Girl	A train pulling into Shibuya stalled this morning. You really think it was the Subway Slammer's fault?
3890251	Sleepy G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl	Can't say for sure. You know	 I've been struck by him at Shibuya Station before.
3890252	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>eepy Girl	I noticed a bad bruise on my shoulder when I got home.
3890253	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Girl	Oh my god	 that's got to be a criminal offense! Did you file a report?
3890254	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>eepy Girl	No... It seemed like it wouldn't be worth all the trouble.
3890255	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Girl	I know what you mean.
3890256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These people are losing hope as well. The situation is more dire than I thought.
3890257	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Because I saw him do it with my own eyes!
3890258	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It was the Subway Slammer!
3890259	Tired Poli<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e Officer	Well	 are you sure it's the same guy? Do you have any proof?
3890260	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Proof...?
3890261	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cameras! Check the security cameras!
3890262	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	I mean	 we'll take a look but...
3900777	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh!
3890263	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know his name! He's an ex-baseball...
3890268	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	Unless we catch him in the act	 there's really no way to arrest him.
3890269	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	Getting pushed around at rush hour's just an everyday occurrence.
3900778	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	Even if we catch him	 there's really nothing we can do if he says it was an accident.
3900779	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	Any other officer would tell you the same thing.
3890270	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	B-But...
3890271	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	I know it's hard to hear	 but it's better to just avoid people like that in the first place.
3890273	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Police Officer	If you see him	 run. That's really the best advice I can give.
3890274	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But that's...
3900860	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Okay	 that's it for homeroom today.
3900861	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Oh	 and about what happened this morning... I'm sure many of you've already heard	 but...
3900862	Anxious-Looking G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl	Noge-san from Class D...
3900863	Anxious-Looking G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl	I was right there when it happened.
3900865	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Quiet.
3900866	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Since the incident is still fresh	 make sure that you all stay clear of danger	 okay?
3900868	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ghthearted Girl	The Subway Slammer was officially condemned	 wasn't he?
3900870	R<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>mor-Loving Girl	He must've been behind this too.
3900871	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Girl	Noge-san's real unlucky.
3900872	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	This is not what I had in mind.
3900873	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Arai-san!
3900874	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I thought because of... Well	 I thought you would have stayed home today.
3900876	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm fine. Sorry I'm late.
3900877	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll be waiting on the roof at lunch.
3900890	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ightly Scary-Looking Student	......
3900892	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry to take over your lunch period.
3900893	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 so it seems like Tomoko's life isn't in danger or anything like that.
3900978	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She was able to talk to me just fine.
3900895	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The thing is...
3900896	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She was supposed to compete in a tournament with the baseball team...
3900897	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But it seems like when she fell on the tracks she... messed up her shoulder pretty badly.
3900898	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She should be fine to play just for fun	 but as a player she...
3900900	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I went to report Kiuchi to the police before coming here	 but it was pointless...
3900902	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry	 anyway	 I called you here to pick up where we left off this morning...
3900903	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME1}-kun	 are you and Kiuchi buddies or something?
3890276	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You've got the wrong idea.
3890277	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The owl!
3890278	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is this bird... a friend of yours? It was talking to you before.
3890279	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Business...? What?
3890280	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So it's your pet?
3890281	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The more accurate term would be business partners.
3890282	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 what?
3890283	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 so disappearing from the train and all
this other weird stuff going on around you...
3890284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...has to do with this "business" you're talking about?
3900916	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do not call me an owl. My name is Lufel.
3890285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sensed there'd be some pertinent
information to be gained from your
conversation	 hence I revealed myself.
3890286	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh...
3900920	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And what is your name?
3900921	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Motoha... Arai...
3900922	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well then	 Motoha Arai	 allow me to fill you in. Kiuchi is no friend of ours.
3890288	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He is	 in fact	 our target. For a certain plan we have in the works.
3890289	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi's your target?
3900924	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We need a target for our Metaverse Navigator application to home in on.
3900925	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Metaverse Navigator...?
3890290	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do you mean this?
3890291	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. Hoohoo	 I see. That explains how you could hear my voice.
3890292	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Motoha Arai. For whatever reason	 you seem to know a great deal about Kiuchi.
3900951	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And despite knowing there's no way he can be punished by law	 you seem intent on finding a way to stop him.
3900952	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Moreover	 the fact that you can hear my voice means that... you hold great potential for hope.
3900953	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Potential for... hope?
3900954	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Those who have abandoned hope are not able to hear my voice.
3890293	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we'll be able to execute Kiuchi's change of heart sooner than I expected.
3890294	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Change of heart?
3890295	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just hold on a damn minute. I have no idea what's going on anymore. First Tomoko gets hurt	 now there's a talking owl and...
3900955	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Changing Kiuchi's heart? Do you know what that means	 {NAME1}-kun?
3900957	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Motoha Arai. Let me ask you this. Knowing
what you do about Kiuchi	 what are you
hoping to accomplish?
3900929	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3900928	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you want to do about him?
3900931	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What... do I want to do?
3900958	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't know... The police clearly won't
help	 and I don't have the physical strength
to stop him on my own.
3900959	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So what will you do?
3900962	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3900963	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You haven't truly manifested your desire for yourself.
3900932	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let me give you a word of advice. If you lack the will to fight for your goal	 don't bother hoping at all.
3900934	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All the people of this world are doing just that. Surely you can fall in with the crowd.
3900936	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you saying... I should just let Kiuchi off the hook!?
3900964	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	After what he did to Tomoko... he'll just keep attacking more people!
3900965	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The "Subway Slammer" even got condemned by Divine Justice this morning.
3900966	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Which means "he's a serious threat the police are doing nothing about	 everyone watch out!"
3900967	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So now all we can do is just give up!
3900968	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If we let him get away with this	 how many more people do you think will end up hurt!?
3900937	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whatever. I'll deal with this on my own.
3900938	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry about lunch.
3900939	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You looked like you wanted to say something.
3900941	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Listen	 battling in the Metaverse means being at constant risk of death.
3900942	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not a place we can bring someone lacking in resolve.
3900944	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Whether she chooses to proceed or turn back is her decision.
3900945	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But if this Motoha Arai's desire is real	 then it seems your fates will intertwine. Hoohoohoo...
3900948	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh nothing.
3900949	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll go to Kiuchi's Palace after school. Now that we have our way in	 we'll investigate the inside.
3900969	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I should ask just in case	 are you resolved to continue tracking down Kiuchi?
3900977	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 and that's why you're my business partner.
3890298	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us head for Mementos. The procedure is the same as last time. Open the Metaverse Navigator at the station squa‚Äî
3890299	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oi! Hide!
3890301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That girl... It appears she is able to sense the Metaverse.
3890302	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	She must have known you disappeared from the train because she witnessed it happen.
3890303	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Did she come here because she anticipated our next move?
3900735	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I appreciate the sincerity of her desire	 but...
3900736	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If a human without a Persona gets lost in the Metaverse	 they're sure to fall victim to wandering Shadows.
3900737	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore we cannot allow her to get mixed up in this. Nor can we take our eyes off her	 given the situation.
3900738	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For all we know	 she could be searching for Kiuchi. If she finds him	 she might be the one in danger.
3900739	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not proud to say it	 but we should surveil this Motoha Arai before entering the Metaverse.
3901012	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko...
3890304	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Motoha Arai... was it?
3901014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi!
3901015	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I remember you. Looks like the little smart-mouthed brat's all grown up.
3890305	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	You know	 you ought to address your superiors with
-san. I thought I already taught you that.
3890308	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've been looking for you.
3890309	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Ah. This about the pigtailed girl that fell on the train tracks?
3890310	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why are you doing this?
3890312	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Why? Because I want to.
3901021	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	But you should know better than anyone...
3901022	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	...the real reason I have to wear some monkey suit and work a goddamn desk job!
3890240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
3890241	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	But of course that was just a silly ol' accident	 right?
3901023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Apologize to Tomoko!
3901024	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	What if I say no?
3901025	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The police will‚Äî
3901026	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Do what	 exactly?
3901027	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Look around you. Nothing but a buncha washed-out faces flatter than stale beer.
3901028	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I can push them around	 and they'll just cry themselves to sleep. And anyone who sees	 they'll just pretend they didn't!
3901029	Takeyuki Ki<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>chi	You think some cop's gonna sympathize with you? What year do you think this is?
3890242	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	So the Subway Slammer's been declared a Menace. Now what? Everyone already knows there's nothing they can do to stop me!
3890040	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	The whole subway's mine for the slammin'! Ahahahahahahahaha!
3890314	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ngh...
3890315	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	So	 I think it's time for the next accident!
3890316	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	After all	 you were the one I was aiming for that time	 Motoha Arai-chan.
3901010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hngh‚Äî
3890318	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Who are you supposed to be?
3901037	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME1}-kun!?
3890320	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Tsk. Arai's little friend	 huh?
3901036	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Someone! Help! That's the Subway Slammer!
3901018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hello!?
3901013	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	You got dirt in your ears or something? I told you already. Nobody cares about strangers anymore	 idiot!
3901030	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I'm gonna keep doing whatever I want	 for as long as I want!
3901031	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	And eventually I'm gonna get you too	 Motoha Arai! Gahahahahahaha!
3901039	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
3901045	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi... why?
3890321	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should get going.
3900475	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's clear we need to stop him without a moment's delay	 or the number of victims will keep piling up.
3890322	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You have a job to do	 right? Don't worry about me.
3890047	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3890323	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is there really... nothing I can do...?
3890324	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Kiuchi	 huh?
3900556	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He takes advantage of the world's fading hope...
3890325	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...and uses it to fulfill his own twisted desires without a grain of remorse.
3890326	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	His despicability knows no bounds. Which makes him a fitting target for robbing.
3890328	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll share the details when the time comes. First we should head for Kiuchi's Palace.
3900960	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like there's still no way of getting
through the front entrance.
3900961	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 let's use our infiltration tool. We'll get in through that duct.
3900970	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're quite the wiz with that wire. It looks like we can make good use of that skill as we move forward.
3900971	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By the way	 is it just me	 or did you have a little too much fun with that?
3890344	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. But that level of skill...
3890345	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh I can tell. Even behind that mask it's obvious.
3890346	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You should enjoy it! Such is the work of a Phantom Thief.
3900975	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyway	 let's get through the duct.
3900980	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The interior is baseball themed as well. How telling...
3900983	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I said before	 a Palace is a manifestation of its ruler's twisted desires.
3890070	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 the shape of this place indicates that...
3900985	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...it was constructed from Kiuchi's desires... that are related to baseball.
3900987	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't know whether he's obsessing over some
past glory days or what	 but he appears to
have an abnormal fixation on baseball.
3900988	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now it's time to get our real mission underway.
3900989	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Stealing the "Treasure" hidden within the palace.
3890348	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's right. It's about time I filled you
in. Let's talk.
3890349	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. It's time I ought to explain our
goal	 and the Treasure	 in more detail.
3890351	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A Palace's Treasure is...
3090265	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...an item that symbolizes the root cause of its ruler's warped desire.
3890353	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why did Kiuchi become the Subway Slammer? This item points to the origin of that behavior.
3890354	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is a symbol of warped desire	 and constitutes the very core of what gives the Palace its form.
3900990	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we manage to steal it	 we can induce a change of heart in Kiuchi.
3900991	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 locating the Treasure that's hidden somewhere in the heart of this Palace is top priority.
3090266	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 like any treasure	 we can expect it to be tightly guarded. Therefore we should focus on learning its location first.
3090267	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The enemies here are likely more aggressive than the ones we've faced thus far.
3090268	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is	 the Shadows of this Palace are distinct from those inside Mementos.
3090269	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Under the control of Kiuchi's intense desires	 they have forgotten their true forms.
3900557	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They will obey his desire and stop at nothing to destroy us for the sake of their king.
3900558	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you feel underprepared	 we could always return to the real world and stock up on whatever items we need.
3900993	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 Wonder	 let's begin!
3890355	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What am I even doing?
3890356	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I hate to admit it	 but that owl was right...
3890357	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm running my mouth	 meanwhile having no clue what I actually want to do.
3890358	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi... Seeing the player I looked up to suddenly appear and...
3890365	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...do something so horrible to Tomoko...
3890360	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	God	 I wish someone would come up and tell me this is all some big joke...
3890361	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just a joke...
3890362	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What was that again	 about a change of heart...?
3890363	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Metaverse Navigator...
3900801	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Aha! That room is...
3900802	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 take out that Shadow. If this goes well	 we'll have a safe place to rest inside the Palace.
3900510	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Simply superb! You've really gotten the hang of this	 Wonder.
3900511	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	You seem awfully satisfied.
3900512	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	Hey	 listen! Do you think I'll ever feel
fulfilled like that?
3900514	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	So I've just gotta follow my heart	 huh?
I like the way you think!
3900515	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	You somehow remind me of myself... Wait...
3900516	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	I'd forgotten. I originated from humanity's Sea of Souls...
3900517	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	My true name is... Oh right! It's <color=#FF423F>Pixie</color>!
3900518	Pi<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>ie	From now on	 I will become a part of you! Your devotion and desire!
3900519	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What was that? The Shadow became your mask?
3896703	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is beyond my comprehension as well	 but...
3899990	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems like the Shadow's desire to join you transformed it into a Persona for you to use.
3899997	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Or something like that...?
3890016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 either way we defeated the enemy. We can talk it over more inside the room just ahead.
3901324	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's just a hunch	 but I think this room...
3901326	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. Let's go in	 Wonder.
3910360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can catch our breath for a while. The Shadows won't come in here.
3910380	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The distortion of the Palace is weaker in this room.
3910381	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That means this is a safe place for us...
A <color=#FF423F>Safe Room</color>	 if you will.
3910382	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I'm still not convinced we can rest here safely. I'd like to poke around a bit more just to be sure.
3900803	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Heheheh. You have shown new potential once again.
3900805	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We are referring to the new Persona you have gained.
3900806	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Normally	 a single human can possess only
one Persona... but you are capable of
harnessing many more.
3900807	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	I believe I've told you this before...
3900808	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You are capable of reawakening not just your own	 but others' forgotten desires.
3900809	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	This applies to Shadows as well. Your exuberant passion for life holds infinite possibilities.
3900854	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Heheh. We shall call this ability of yours
the power of the <color=#FF423F>wild card</color>.
3900855	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	This rare power allows you to yield multiple Personas. Use it wisely.
3900856	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You	 who have awakened to this power	 hold even more potential...
3900857	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	But the time you will know it is further still.
3900858	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Heheh	 I must agree with your concierge Merope.
3900859	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Well... When your heart has strengthened through bonds with others	 we will summon you again.
3900181	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please do work to foster your desire.
3900182	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	So long as you steadfastly cultivate desire	 a path will surely open itself to you.
3900183	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Apologies for the abrupt summons. For now	 please proceed the way your will directs you.
3900184	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something the matter	 Wonder? You've been quite still for some time.
3900191	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 no matter. I've searched the room	 and it seems to be free of danger.
3900192	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows won't be coming to steal our desires in here	 so we can prepare and strategize at ease.
3900197	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let me know when you are ready to depart. And don't forget to prepare.
3901040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So Kiuchi was a baseball player? That doesn't match the impression he gave off in Shibuya.
3901042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyhoo	 how are you thinking we should proceed from here? Are there any leads we can‚Äî
3901044	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What the...!? How...!? Where am‚Äîwhat is this place!?
3901046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Motoha Arai!? What are you doing here?
3901048	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	H-H-How the heck did I get here? I was just at Shibuya Station a second ago.
3901049	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. You must have used the Metaverse Navigator. The eye-shaped icon on your phone.
3900156	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Metaverse... Navigator?
3901062	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Aaah!
3901063	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wh-Wh-What are you!? Some sort of mascot!? Wait... Black hood... Yellow eyes... Are you a hooded ghost!?
3901064	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hooded ghost?
3901065	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And what are you!? A burglar!?
3901066	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 wait a second... Is that you... {NAME1}-kun?
3901068	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	W-What?
3901069	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Literally what is happening? Wait	 is this like... a cosplay convention?
3901093	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I mean	 there are weird statues of Kiuchi	 and apparently merch...?
3901094	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is Kiuchi's Palace. The decor has materialized from his cognitions.
3901095	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi's... Palace? Built from his... cognitions?
3901096	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mhmmm... Aha! I get it! This is a dream! Yup	 for sure.
3901097	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	While I appreciate her tenacity	 we need to get her out of here right now.
3901098	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We may not be able to defend her if Shadows come attacking.
3901099	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph. Automatic lock	 eh?
3710725	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be a clue around here somewhere that shows how to get out.
3710726	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 what? We're locked in!?
3710727	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Motoha Arai. I would like you to share any information you have on Kiuchi with us forthwith.
3710736	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh...?
3901051	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This photo... It's from my little league baseball training. What's it doing here?
3901052	?<#000000	?	#FFFFFF>?	Think harder! That's when it happened. I	 the star athlete	 entered a slump!
3901053	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
3901054	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Was that...?
3890364	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I said this was Kiuchi's Palace	 did I not? His cognitions from real life...
3901056	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...and the source of his twisted desire	 are all reflected here.
3901057	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3901058	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh... I see.
3901059	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To think Motoha Arai would be pictured in Kiuchi's Palace...
3901060	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He must feel some kind of disturbing connection to her.
3901061	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......!
3900273	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh... No	 it's nothing	 really.
3900274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm	 seems the door unlocked itself. I suppose looking at the photo was the key.
3900275	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've gained enough valuable intel on Kiuchi. Now let's make our exit.
3900278	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is bad!
3711402	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Waaah!
3910404	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ughty Man	What's that? Intruders?
3910405	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ughty Man	Then start with that!
3910406	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ughty Man	I didn't think you'd have the guts to face me willingly	 Motoha Arai.
3910407	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ughty Man	How about a trip down memory lane? Your
offenses	 your crimes...! I'll make you
remember... in excruciating detail.
3910408	M<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>sterious Announcement	Execution of intruders will begin momentarily.
3901123	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oww... What the hell is going on?
3901137	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We were dropped down a pit. It must have been a trap for intruders.
3901138	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Before anything	 we need to find a way out of here. Wonder	 search the room for an exit.
3901139	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Every exit is sealed... There must be an unlocking mechanism like the one before around here somewhere.
3901142	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Voice	Wow	 that was truly a nice	 square hit!
3901143	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What is it?
3901144	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do you see that?
3901145	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is from... after that baseball clinic...?
3901160	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Motoha Arai	 what was your reaction when you managed to hit Kiuchi's game-deciding slider?
3901161	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I thought Kiuchi's pitching stance looked really cool!
3901162	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Oh	 I meant to ask how you felt. Like	 "The ball was fast!"	 or "I felt amazing!" Any thoughts like that?
3901164	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmmm...
3901165	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He threw me a slider just like I asked him to!
3901172	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So I think he's just the best!
3901199	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Hahah	 I see you have a lot of respect for him!
3901201	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Now	 let's hear a word from Kiuchi on Arai's performance.
3901202	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Ah	 she's	 uh... what'd you call it...? Talented. She seems like a talented kid.
3901266	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	A fine line drive so powerful it slipped through your grip resulting in a double!
3901267	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	You even fell on your backside. Talk about putting on a show!
3901286	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Tsk...
3901287	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	I don't think I need to ask this but... that was all an act	 right?
3901288	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	What?
3901295	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I mean... Haha	 of course it was! She's only in grade school!
3900829	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Indeed she is.
3900830	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	As someone on track for the major league	 I'm sure even pro hitters would be in for a challenge if you were playing seriously.
3900831	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	......
3900835	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Kiuchi...?
3900836	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Huh? Uh... Nothing	 I'm cool! Haha...
3900864	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	Uh... Anyway	 Arai	 I hear you actually main as a pitcher.
3900869	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! I love throwing and hitting!
3900904	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	!?
3900905	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	A pitcher with a strong sense for batting too.
We're certainly looking forward to what
the future has in store for you.
3900906	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>terviewer	That's all for our ground coverage from the baseball training infield.
3900950	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3900908	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That video... Was that from a baseball clinic Kiuchi taught when he was still a professional player?
3900909	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	His pitch got knocked out of the park by a grade-school-aged Motoha Arai...
3900910	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Better yet	 he got knocked flat on his back trying to stop it. That must have damaged his ego.
3900911	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah... Kiuchi has been in a big slump ever since...
3900913	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All because I hit that pitch...
3900915	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see we have a lot to process here	 but now is not the time.
3900918	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows could burst in here any minute. We must find some means of escape.
3900919	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Although I do wonder... why were we just shown a video of Kiuchi's past?
3901341	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3901342	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something feels off about this. It's as if someone planned to make us watch that video.
3901343	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And there was that pitfall before. I think they might be on to us.
3901344	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Stay on your guard.
3900927	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Voice	I hear your stats are in the dirt recently.
3900930	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh? There's another video.
3900943	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Now here I thought you were aiming for the majors.
3890055	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Well... yeah...
3900984	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	You don't sound so sure. And you should know crying	 "Slump!" as an excuse isn't gonna cut it.
3900986	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Coach	 can't you push him a little harder?
3890313	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	We're all here to support you.
3901019	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	And with the major league on the horizon	 we've even heard word about a few potential sponsors.
3901020	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ad Coach	*sigh* He understands that	 but...
3901032	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Well it's that or be known as the guy that got beat by an elementary school girl.
3901033	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	......
3901034	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	What was it those rag mags were saying? "Kiuchi Clocked by Clutch Hit Cutie"?
3901035	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	If you have even a shred of dignity	 you'd get back out on the field and prove them wrong.
3901043	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ad Coach	Understood.
3901050	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Ngh!
3901055	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ad Coach	Kiuchi.
3901075	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Right. Coming...
3901104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That appears to be from the early days of his downward spiral.
3901105	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3901107	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's nothing. I'm‚Äî

3900923	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	You see the article?
Apparently Kiuchi's
in a slump.
3900926	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Hey	 the girl in the news looks like Arai.
3900671	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	No way! Seriously?
3900672	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Yeah	 seems like he got hurt during the baseball clinic.
3900674	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	From the pitch Arai hit?
3900677	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Yeah	 now Kiuchi's
in a total slump
because of it.
3900678	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Arai...
3900683	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Arai did it.
3900684	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	It's her fault.
3900685	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Completely her fault.
3900690	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>moko Noge	No! Motoha didn't do anythi‚Äî!
3900724	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Arai ruined his career...

3900635	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't stay here! Let's go find her!
3901100	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey! What the heck are you doing!? Let me go!
3890057	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Voice	Aw	 look who's exacting demands.
3901101	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ughty Man	Fancy meeting you here at Kiuchi-sama Stadium	 Motoha Arai.

3901103	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That face... That voice... You're just like
Kiuchi... but how!?
3890371	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	That's Kiuchi"-sama" to you!
3890372	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah!
3890373	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	You really are the same little insolent brat
you were back then	 only bigger!
3901109	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	You goddamn pest. It was all your fault!
3901110	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	All because you hit my game-winning slider ten years ago.
3901113	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	How do you know that...? I guess you really are Kiuchi.
3901114	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	I said it's "-sama" to you!
3901115	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ow!
3901116	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	To think you had the gall to tell me to apologize back at the station.
3901117	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	Aren't I the one who deserves an apology? You ruined my career!
3901118	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hngh...
3901119	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	This is a good time to teach you somethin' ya
never learned at baseball training: how to
beg for forgiveness like a big girl.
3890058	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi?	Let's see you bow your head in shame!
3901120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch! She's been captured!

3901124	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is that... Kiuchi's Shadow!?
3901126	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows are the embodiment of a human's hidden	 inner self. That form is a manifestation of his desires.
3901127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But more importantly	 we need to save Motoha Arai!
3901128	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Yeah right!
3901129	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	You can just stand and watch. My business is with this one.
3901130	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Once I settle the score with her	 you can all go. Well	 after you've undergone some intense training.
3901131	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Agh! That hurts!
3901133	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Ahahaha! Like I'd listen to you? You don't seem to get how screwed you really are!

3890376	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Now	 kneel before me.
3890377	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	What's wrong? So scared your brain stopped working?
3901140	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Why don't I jog your memory?
3901141	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I quit baseball because of you!
3890378	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hgh... Agh!
3890379	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	All because you hit that damn pitch! I had a slump	 and it ruined my chance at the major leagues!
3890380	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah... Aah...

3710920	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	That's right! You stole my life as an athlete away from me and destroyed my dreams!
3900636	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	What did you just say?
3900637	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	You don't know what you're talking about	 so shut it! No one wants to hear from the outfield!
3900639	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha...
3900640	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	What did you say!?

3900642	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The one who abandoned that desire... that dream	 was you	 Kiuchi!
3900643	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	What! How dare you!?
3900644	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As humans live and pursue their desires...
3900645	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...sometimes they can get in the way of another's.
3900646	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But that doesn't mean they should abandon their hopes completely.
3900653	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......!
3900654	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You simply wanted someone else to blame	 so you could justify throwing away your desires.
3900655	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And now	 you	 with your distorted	
self-aggrandizing soul	 continue to steal
away the hopes of countless others!
3900659	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	S-Shut your mouth! None of this would have happened if it weren't for this brat!
3900312	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I always thought... I was the one to blame...
3900313	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Because of me	 Kiuchi	 the player I looked up to most	 quit baseball.
3890031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I no longer felt worthy of the life I had... and lost the will to hope for anything.
3890032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I thought I had to give up baseball... give up my dreams...
3900331	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...!?
3900354	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Enough with the chitchat!
3900286	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Listen up! I've got your little friend here by the neck!
3890027	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	So shut up	 or the next crack of the bat's gonna be a skull splitter!
3890028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch...!
3890029	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Now hurry up and beg for mercy	 Motoha Arai!
3900301	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Or do I have to teach you a lesson like I did to that pigtailed brat!?
3890429	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
3900302	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You mean... Tomoko?
3900303	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Huh? Ohhh	 was that her name?
3900355	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Her name is Tomoko Noge... She's my best friend.
3900377	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ever since little league	 and even after I quit baseball... Tomoko has always been there for me.
3890038	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She dreamed of being a baseball player.
3900384	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm no better than you... I chose to abandon my dreams.
3901111	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I made myself out like some tragic martyr...
3710720	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I kept up a front while carrying this huge emptiness inside me... I even wished I was dead.
3900199	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But Tomoko...!
3890020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko didn't get a choice when you ripped her dreams away from her!
3890021	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Wha‚Äî!?
3890384	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You should know better than anyone just how painful it is to give up your dream!
3890385	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	How dare you‚Äî
3901163	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Arrgh! Just shut your mouth already!

3901166	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Keep on throwing away your humanity like that and you'll have nothing left.

3901181	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I won't give up anymore!

3901192	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî What!?
3901193	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What is this!?
3901194	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 since when was I wearing this outfit?
3901209	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	H-Hold on a sec... I feel like all my energy is...
3901210	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The rebound from your Persona awakening is causing fatigue. We'd best return to the real world for now.
3901212	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's a Persona?
3901213	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You mean that thing that came out of me before? Calling itself Awilda...? You know what that is?
3901215	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You want many answers.
3901216	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A splendid thing to desire	 truly. But do remember we're still in the middle of a Palace.
3901217	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 let's head back to the real world.
3901218	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I want to secure both Motoha Arai's safety and some time in which to provide her with an explanation.
3901221	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I can keep going... Let's get Kiuchi and‚Äî
3901222	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*pant* Actually... let's go with... your plan...
3901224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Get in.
3901225	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME1}-kun	 truth is...
3901226	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm starving...
3901240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The Metaverse	 cognitions	 Palaces	 and Kiuchi's Shadow... Right.
3901241	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You seem to have picked it all up quite quickly. Were you even shaken when you got lost in the Metaverse?
3901242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Not really... It was more like I thought it was all a dream.
3901243	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I used the Metaverse Navigator	 went to the Palace	 and saw everything with my own eyes...
3901244	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Now I'm here talking to an owl. I'm just rolling with it at this point.
3901245	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't think I forgot about you calling me a ghost.
3901246	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 Lufel	 I didn't know you were the type to hold a grudge. Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers!
3890390	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By the way	 Kiuchi's Palace being a baseball stadium...
3901247	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Once you said it was linked to his desires	 I immediately saw the connection.
3901248	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you think you're ready to talk about what happened with him?
3901249	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think you already know bits and pieces of it	 but I'll explain.
3901250	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Takeyuki Kiuchi is a former baseball player.
3901251	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Until a few years ago he was this incredible	
fiery rookie that everyone said was destined
for greatness in the major leagues.
3901297	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Back when I used to play... I always thought he was so cool...
3901299	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 we have to talk about that! Total misogynist creep	 right!?
3901315	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 that and... "Bizarre" isn't quite the right word... I suppose you could say he laid his desires bare for all to see.
3901316	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are other Shadows of people that exist within Mementos besides Kiuchi.
3901317	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But his is the first I've ever seen with its own Palace	 and so deeply infected by desire I might add.
3901318	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's exactly why we have to change his heart. Especially since the real Kiuchi shows no signs of stopping on his own.
3901252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 what you were saying at lunch	 about how
we're supposed to change Kiuchi's heart...
I think I got the gist of it	 but...
3901254	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Basically we have to steal his Treasure	 right? What will happen to him after that?
3890391	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've yet to explain that bit to {NAME2}-kun too. Now's as good a time as any.
3901256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First	 his distorted desires will dissipate	 but the memories of his crimes will remain.
3901258	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Unable to bear the weight of that reality	 the Palace's ruler will confess his wrongdoings by his own will.
3901260	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So then	 Kiuchi will admit what he did to Tomoko?
3901261	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He will confess to everything. Without exception.
3901319	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really... So Tomoko will‚Äî!
3901327	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 that does not mean the desires he stole from others will return to their rightful owners.
3901328	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All those people will have to recover by their own strength. Tomoko included.
3901329	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So we can't take everything back with just the change of heart. Okay	 well	 this time it's my turn to be there for Tomoko.
3901330	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Speaking of	 we really need to stop Kiuchi as soon as possible. Before someone else gets hurt as badly as she did.
3901331	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Steady now. We just had a rather precarious encounter with those Shadows back in the Metaverse.
3901332	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By now the Palace's security has certainly tightened	 and it will take time for us to come up with a plan of action.
3901333	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Since the incident with Tomoko happened so recently	 Kiuchi will likely be more cautious.
3901334	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 now is not the time to be hasty. If we take a misstep	 it's all over.
3901335	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right... Yeah	 that's a good call	 Lufel.
3901336	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Gotta keep my head cool	 and my drive fierce...*exhale* I'm cool.
3901337	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You seem rather... excitable when you're around him...
3901263	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I want to become a Phantom Thief.
3901264	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If the world refuses to bring Kiuchi's actions under scrutiny...
3901265	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then I'll make Kiuchi face up to it himself.
3901268	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It seems like there's no way to stop him from the real world.
3901269	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But maybe I can stop him from the Metaverse	 as a Phantom Thief.
3901270	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So let's do this!
3901272	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're strong and determined. No objections here. You are welcome to join.
3901274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that's decided	 we'll need to think of a code name for you	 Motoha Arai.
3901275	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You can just call me Motoha! The full name's a bit too formal. And {NAME1}-kun	 I'll call you by your first name from now on.
3901277	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why do we need code names anyway?
3901278	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a name we use to disguise our identities in the Metaverse.
3901279	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sounds official. What are your names?
3901280	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Mine is Cattle. {NAME2}-kun's is Wonder.
3901281	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Those have kind of a fantastical vibe to them. I'll go with something in that vein...
3901283	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay... What's something that sounds mysterious...?
3901284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ooh	 how about "Closer"? That's what they call the pitcher that comes in to finish a baseball game.
3890392	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Some people also say "Stopper."
3890393	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is it cool to pick my own name? I just think it sounds enigmatic.
3901338	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And it could also mean like	 "We're the last stand against Kiuchi!" Kinda nice	 right?
3901289	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fine by me! It's your code name after all. If you know what you want to be called	 all the better.
3901291	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh right	 we should get each other's contact info.
3901292	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Got it.
3901293	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I should probably get going. Talk to you guys later!
3901296	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should head home as well.
3710800	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You ready to go?
3710802	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You said it's a shop	 correct? What kind of shop?
3710803	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You'll see!
3710780	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A shop that could aid our Palace
infiltration plan? Hoohoo	 sounds like it
should prove worthwhile.
3710735	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 so we go straight down here...
then take a left... and it should be
around there. Follow me!
3710804	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! I see. An <color=#FF423F>airsoft shop</color>?
3710805	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's right! We're gonna need weapons and stuff	 right?
3710830	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 but I guess they don't sell any real guns...
3710831	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Actually	 a model gun or sword will be plenty. Remember how the Metaverse runs on cognitions?
3710832	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So long as the enemy thinks our weapons are real	 they'll function in the same way real ones do.
3710833	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That means even a toy gun has the potential to be a deadly weapon.
3710834	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really!? Man	 the cognitive world's nuts.
3710806	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	'Sup.
3710807	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He's kind of brusque... Oh	 whatever.
3710809	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've never set foot in a place like this before. I don't even know where to start...
3710810	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And I'm not sure my allowance will cover it...
3710811	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we're looking to broaden our range of battle tactics	 firearms are the way to go.
3710812	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 firearms... Where are the firearms...?
3710813	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	H-Huh?
3710814	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	You both don't look like military buffs to me.
3710835	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	I find you especially suspicious	 little lady.
3710815	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Little lady?
3710816	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	You kids gonna run around with my goods and make trouble for me?
3710817	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh crap! I heard rumors this guy was shady!
3710818	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You could've said that before we came in here...
3710819	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	Give me answers. Tell me why you came here.
3710823	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What th‚Äî!? I mean... You've got that right!
3710825	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	Don't see many types like you these days...
3710826	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rly Manager	I'm not gonna ask for specifics	 but long as you're not looking to fill some sad sack with lead	 that's good enough for me.
3710827	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	<color=#FF423F>Munehisa</color>... <color=#FF423F>Iwai</color>?
3710828	Mune<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>isa Iwai	Take it.
3710829	Mune<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>isa Iwai	Sorry for callin' you little lady. I'll give you something special.
3710880	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really? For free?
3710881	Mune<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>isa Iwai	To make up for being too suspicious of you.
3710882	Mune<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>isa Iwai	Just don't go causing a scene and make
things... difficult for me or my customers.
3710883	Mune<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>isa Iwai	Come again.
3710910	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Welp	 we got ourselves an arms dealer.
3710911	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sharing intel	 succeeding in missions... We're really starting to feel like a proper cohort.
3710913	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cohort? That sounds super old	 Lufel.
3901177	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh... Is that right?
3901178	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're phantom thieves	 so let's just call ourselves "The Phantom Thieves	 yeah?
3710914,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,The Phantom Thieves, huh? Not bad.
3710915,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,If we're making it official, we should decide
on a <color=#FF423F>leader</color> too. I guess that'd be you, right, {NAME2}-kun?
3710917,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,No objections here.
3901179,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,A leader has to manage their team members, right? I would prefer to focus on myself.
3710919,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Then it's settled. Congrats, Leader! Any words of inspiration for us?
3890397,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ooh, nice energy! I like it.
3890399,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Really?
3890400,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Someone's not good at thinking on the spot...
3890401,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,As long as we get the job done, I will allow you to dictate the pace.
3710921,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,With the Phantom Thieves on my side, I should be able to accomplish my goal as well... Heheheh.
3710922,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Anyway, what should we do next?
3710924,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Okay then, let's call it a day for now.
3710925,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,The weapons we got came with instructions, so I'll make sure to read up on those.
3710926,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh, and make sure to let me know when you wanna go into the Metaverse. I'll rush right over. See you later!
3890402,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,So, Leader, from here on you're not living just for yourself anymore.
3890404,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Your choices are going to affect me and Motoha as well.
3890405,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We'll be counting on you to be even more upstanding than you have been thus far.
3890407,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Well, as the founder of the group, I don't mind giving you a bit more direction.
3890408,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,First off, would you say you're doing well financially?
3890410,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Ah, that's right. You do live in a rather lavish home.
3901183,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,But this will be a good opportunity. You ought to learn how to earn money for yourself.
3890411,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,That won't do. An empty wallet's bound to hinder our work as Phantom Thieves.
3890412,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I see. So you don't have an excess of wealth at your disposal?
3890414,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's get you a part time job so you can start saving up.
3901184,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It sounds like a job is just what you need to whip your attitude into shape.
3890416,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Don't worry, I already have a job in mind. In the worst-case scenario, I will be there to pick up the pieces.
3890417,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I saw a help wanted sign in the window of a nearby convenience store.
3901188,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's head over there now.
3910330,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Well done. Now you're able to make money on your own.
3910332,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Good for you.
3910333,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I mean it. You're brimming with confidence. From my perspective at least.
3890419,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoohoo! Bursting with desire as ever. I knew you were a dependable leader.
3910334,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Now, on to the next bit of training.
3910336,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Cultivating your knowledge and intelligence will be critical to our work as Phantom Thieves. We must refine ourselves.
3910337,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,And you are a student after all.
3910402,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Now that you're living a double life, you'll have to learn to study more efficiently.
3910338,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems many people do their studying at
these <color=#FF423F>diners</color>."
3910339	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They have a pleasant atmosphere	 and there happens to be one right nearby.
3910403	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You should try studying there.
3910350	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nice work. You've found a good way to maintain your devotion to your studies.
3910351	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like we still have some time before night settles in.
3910352	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a good opportunity. Moving forward	
you will assume control of our activities.
3910353	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll be trusting you to make decisions as
team leader after all. I'll go along with
whatever you decide. Do as you please.
3910354	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course going straight home is also a valid option.
3710940	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well then	 I will make myself at home. If you
want to craft infiltration tools	 give me a
hoot and I will provide guidance.
3910383	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's take our time exploring this area.
3910390	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done.
3910391	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From here	 you can return to Shibuya.
3910392	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You can continue exploring Mementos as it is. I'll leave it up to you whether to withdraw or not.
3910400	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To ensure the operation goes smoothly	 we need to investigate the Palace.
3910401	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Once you're ready	 we'll head back to the palace.
3910410	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've arranged a special training for you tomorrow. We'll be going to Mementos.
3910411	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's going to be quite tough	 so make sure to rest well today.
3910420	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Will you use your free time for reading or studying?
3910421	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Both are suitable methods for improving
your <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>.
3910422	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If it's a quiet and calm place	 you can study and read efficiently.
3910423	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... Your house seems to have a suitable place for either.
3910430	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps now we are able to advance?
3910431	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time is limited. Make a careful plan and spend your days wisely.
3910440	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a <color=#FF423F>gym</color> down <color=#FF423F>Shibuya Center Street</color>.
3910441	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Maybe you could do some physical training there.
3910450	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why not tidy up your room for a change of pace?
3910451	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Spending time in a clean room feels good	 don't you think?
3910460	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I heard something a bit unusual.
3910461	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a tabby cat in Zoshigaya. I've heard it behaves somewhat strangely.
3910462	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though I'm not sure what they mean by "strange"...
3910463	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps we should look for it and find out?
3910470	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I heard there's a popular movie out.
3910471	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you're interested	 how about going to
the <color=#FF423F>Shibuya movie theater</color>?
3910480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I heard there's a nice caf√© in Yongen-Jaya. You could stop by if you want a break.
3910481	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By the way	 I also saw some sort of fundraising drive in front of Shibuya Station. I wonder what their goal is...
3910490	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I remember you had some video games in your room.
3910491	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's quite amusing to watch you play them. Show me again when you have time.
3910600	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we can't proceed from here. Let's look for another route.
3910601	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perfect timing. Let's test the power we just acquired on that Shadow over there.
3910610	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense the same energy from this as the
<color=#FF423F>Red Fog</color>.
3910611	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The power of the wave seems quite weak	 but 
it might be enough to open the door from 
earlier.
3910612	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To proceed further	 it seems we need to collect more of these objects.
3910613	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For now	 try using it on the door from earlier.
3910621	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No problem. I sense a presence nearby.
3910630	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Shadow ahead has a peculiar presence...
3910632	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense something from within its form. It appears to have amassed human desire within itself...
3910633	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is just my guess	 but did it swallow a stack of tickets...?
3910640	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seems to be something on the ground
over there...
3910650	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a safe room.
3910651	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's also a good idea to prepare yourself before moving forward.
3910660	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This door doesn't look like it opens.
3910661	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's look for the Shadow with the ticket.
3910670	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With this ticket	 it looks like we can open the door from earlier.
3910671	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's head back and give it a try.
3910680	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we're getting close to the Treasure...
3910681	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Shadow guarding this place looks quite formidable.
3910682	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's give it everything we've got.
3910690	A<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>id Kiuchi F<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n	You little brat! Don't you dare defy Kiuchi-sama!
3910691	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ugh... That was a powerful blow. We must do something.
3910692	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Strange... The attack didn't hit...?
3910693	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	This one seems to have some kind of special power... I'll look into it	 so wait a moment.
3910694	A<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>id Kiuchi F<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n	I am always training for Kiuchi-sama! You guys are no match for me!
3910695	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's readying a powerful strike. Brace yourself!
3910696	A<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>id Kiuchi F<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n	I'll crush anyone who dares to defy Kiuchi-sama!
3910697	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	This seems bad...
3910698	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Very well	 leave it to me!
3910699	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh... Did the enemy's movements slow down?
3910700	A<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>id Kiuchi F<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n	No way	 my love for Kiuchi-sama can't be in vain!
3910701	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Amazing!
3910702	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Hehe	 I just disrupted their movements a bit. Now's your chance	 go for it!
3910710	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are enemies ahead... Be careful.
3910711	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Following Closer's previous suggestion	 I believe it should make the perfect target to test out our new weapons.
3910712	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What!? How are they so fast!?
3910713	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A door	 and a Shadow guarding it... huh. If we defeat it	 the door should open.
3910714	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps now we are able to advance?
3710730	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we can't go any further from here.
3710731	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us leave for today.
3710732	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems there are no more places to investigate around here.
3710733	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME2}-kun	 you made it. Well	 then	 let's go.
3710734	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Follow me.
3710950	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Morning... *yawn*
3710952	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The weapon's manual was suuuper long. I fell asleep reading it. Kinda messed up my neck.
3710954	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I really prefer to learn by doing. If you end
up going to the Metaverse	 I'd like to
come with and <color=#FF423F>test it out</color> for real.
3710955	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're probably gonna start having more expenses soon	 huh? Guess I should think about getting a job...
3710996	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	I'm Ms. Taniyama. I'll be your world history
teacher. I hope you're as excited to learn
as I am to teach you all.
3710956	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I still wanna have free time to chill out and go to the movies and stuff.
3710957	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 and we can't forget we're students before
anything else. We've gotta study and... Ugh!
There's just not enough time in the day!
3710963	Station Announcement	The train will arrive shortly on track one.
3710964	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 I guess I should figure out how I'm gonna spend my time after school from now on.
3710965	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll make sure to be on standby for when you decide we're going to the Metaverse.
3710980	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	All right everyone	 let's continue our lesson on the French Revolution.
3710981	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Now remember how a despot's legacy will change depending on whether or not they have the support of the masses?
3710983	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Sort of tangential to that	 there are many examples of thieves from that era who've come to be viewed as heroes.
3710984	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Perhaps you've heard them referred to as
chivalrous thieves?
3710985	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Now today's forecast looks to be cloudy with a chance of... {PLAYER_NAME}-san! See if you can answer this question.
3710987	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Which of these people is the thief who inspired Slovakia's Robin Hood?
3710989	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Well	 I suppose they're still not very well known in Japan.
3710990	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The answer is Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k.
3710991	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's right. Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k.
3710992	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	He only targeted wealthy elites who caused suffering for the masses. Then he would give his bounty to the poor.
3710993	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Stories of his deeds were praised and passed along by the people	 who even erected a statue in his honor.
3710994	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A thief who fought against the avarice of man...
3710995	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sounds a little like us	 does it not? Hoohoo.
3711010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm headed to the library	 but if you wanna go to the Metaverse	 just let me know	 'kay?
3711017	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm trying to find an effective training method	 so I thought I'd look it up.
3711018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If I find a book that's useful	 I'm gonna check it out.
3711012	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I was thinking about this during class	 but...
3711014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ever since we started fighting	 I've realized my body is kinda weak and sluggish.
3711015	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	For Tomoko's sake	 we can't afford to lose	 so I figured I should do what I can to get stronger.
3711016	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then I thought	 maybe I could study and train at the same time... but I'm not sure how that would work	 haha. So	 library it is.
3711030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm kinda nervous being back here... Oh yeah	 we gotta use code names	 right? Wonder and Cattle	 was it?
3711032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely	 Closer.
3711033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a Shadow just ahead.
3711034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Following Closer's previous suggestion	 I believe it should make the perfect target to test out our new weapons.
3711060	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's use the weapons Iwai-san gave us!
3711061	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remember what I told you about enemy
weaknesses? These Shadows are weak
to guns. Use that to knock them down.
3711062	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That means fighting with guns will give us
the advantage!
3711013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 we need to hit each enemy in its weakness. Give us your orders.
3711065	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes! Okay	 every enemy is downed. Now it's
time for an <color=#FF423F>All-Out Attack</color>!
3711080	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Woohoo! Teamwork makes the dream work! Who knew victory could be so intoxicating?
3711098	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah. Now that I think of it	 I don't know what intoxication feels like in the first place	 hahaha.
3711100	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But launching a coordinated attack like that was awesome. Kinda takes me back to my baseball days.
3711101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I do feel that we're really starting to live up to the Phantom Thieves' name.
3711102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But Closer	 you executed your attack slightly too late.
3711103	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Seriously? Maaan... I guess I'm still not used to fighting yet.
3711140	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You seem to have found a place for yourself in your world.
3711142	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Master is referring to your role in the Phantom Thieves.
3711143	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Deepening your bonds with others will profoundly influence the strength of your heart	 that of your Persona.
3711144	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Whether these bonds of yours will stave off the coming ruin... or be the primary catalyst for chaos...
3711145	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Heheh. That lies in your own hands.
3711147	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	I think he is ready to handle it now.
3711148	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I will now introduce to you the process of
Persona <color=#FF423F>Fusion</color>.
3711150	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Just as the interactions between you and
other embracers of desire synthesize
into bonds...
3711151	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Think of this as a synthesis between pieces
of yourself. Personas are the personalities
within you that embrace desire.
3711152	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	By the synthesis of these personalities through Fusion	 a new personality is born.
3711153	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	The wild card... it is an ability unique to you. However...
3711154	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The creation of a new Persona through Fusion
also constitutes the dissolution of your bond
with your old Personas.
3711156	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please keep this in mind.
3711157	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Now then	 once again.
3711158	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Allow me to welcome you back to the Velvet Room.
3711200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You think so too	 right	 Wonder?
3711201	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? You weren't listening?
3711202	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You were staring into space again. Is that a habit of yours?
3711204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right... Let me just fill you in on our discussion.
3711207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We were saying that from now on	 as leader of the Phantom Thieves	 you should command us in the field and in battle.
3711208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And now with our All-Out Attack	 we have the
potential to deal heavy damage to
powerful enemies.
3711209	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We should make use of it when the time is
right. So	 should we head to Kiuchi's
Palace now?
3711210	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 but didn't you say security would tighten since we were found out last time?
3711211	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is correct. Furthermore	 Closer is still not used to combat.
3711212	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps it'd be best to battle with enemies in Mementos until you find your footing.
3711213	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not a Metaverse expert by any means	 but it seems like a suitable place for gathering experience.
3711205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But if you want to head straight for the Palace	 that's fine as well. If so	 I'll give you a lift.
3711206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The decision is yours	 Wonder.
3711230	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh? This feeling...
3711231	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Everything OK?
3711232	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a safe room here. Let's use it.
3711233	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's a safe room?
3711250	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Something about this place feels different.
3711251	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a room where the Palace's distortion is weaker. That means we're able to rest here safely. Hence	 Safe Room.
3711252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahh	 I see	 so it's like making it safely to base!
3711253	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Maybe I'll take a rest for a bit. I am actually pretty tired.
3711254	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 Cattle	 you really know a lot of stuff about the Metaverse and Palaces	 huh?
3711255	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I haven't had the chance to ask you until now	 but what exactly is your goal?
3711256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 you see...
3711257	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh? I'm listening...
3711258	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't know.
3711259	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Y-You don't? How could you not?
3711260	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I said before	 there is a strong drive within me that believes humans should embrace desire...
3711261	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But somehow	 it seems the better part of my memories vanished when I entered the real world.
3711263	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I do think I know a way to bring my memories back. Namely	 taking the Palace's Treasure.
3711265	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh... I see.
3711266	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then let's get that Treasure from Kiuchi ASAP and bring your memories back!
3711267	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right	 Wonder?
3711269	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3711270	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm	 are you okay	 Cattle?
3711271	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Usually this is where you'd would say something like	 "Hoohoo! What stupendous desire!"
3711272	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I do not talk like that!
3711273	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 anyway	 I was just thinking... You two seem very trusting of me	 but...
3711274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As humans	 is it really okay for you to accept a mysterious being like me into the fold so easily?
3711275	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What? Of course it is! If you weren't around...
3711276	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wonder and I would be desireless	 and not to mention pummeled by Shadows.
3711277	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Heheh. So if anything	 you're more like our guardian angel.
3711279	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah...
3711280	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I-I see...
3711281	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well if you two say so	 then I'm prepared to give my all to the Phantom Thieves.
3711282	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And to accomplishing all of our goals.
3711283	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right! Happy to have you aboard	 Lufel!
3711284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! This is kind of like give and take	 right? Wow	 we really are like phantom thieves!
3711285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not "like" them	 we are Phantom Thieves. Also	 my name is Cattle here.
3711286	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 sorry! Forgot about the code names	 hahaha...
3890420	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 is this...?
3890421	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. This is where we were shown the videos of Kiuchi's past.
3890422	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looking back	 he probably intended to manipulate Closer by making her remember past trauma.
3901340	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! Boy	 it makes me mad just thinking
about it. Let's go snatch that Treasure from
Kiuchi right now!
3890479	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nicked Woman's Voice	I can't. I'm being called to another table...
3890480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm? That voice... Is it another video from Kiuchi's past?
3900271	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 sorry...
3710721	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think I need to see it.
3710722	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know I decided to stop ignoring my self and my desires	 but...
3710723	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think I need to come to grips with what happened in Kiuchi's past first.
3710724	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I can't ignore the fact that I'm part of the reason things turned out this way.
3711511	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. Your resolve is quite noble.
3901112	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So this video's probably from the time after Kiuchi was reprimanded by the club about his slump.
3900828	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And it takes place in... a club?
3890481	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Nooo	 don't go Rimi-chaaan. Don't ignore meee.
3890483	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>mi	I'll be right back.
3890484	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>mi	Ugh!
3890485	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Rimi-chaaan!
3890486	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Damn it!
3890487	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>npai Columnist	So Kiuchi-san	 now that Rimi-chan's gone...
3890565	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>npai Columnist	You think we can get started with the interview now?
3890566	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>npai Columnist	You must have practice tomorrow too	 so...
3890488	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Practice?
3890489	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Who d'ya think yer talkin' to? I'm Kiuchiii. Future Major League All-Star Ki-u-chi!
3890492	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I can miss one lousy practice!
3890493	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Hey! My cup's empty! And get more girls over here!
3890494	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>npai Columnist	Man	 he's even worse than people say.
3890495	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>npai Columnist	We should leak this story as a special feature before he gets to the majors.
3890496	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Blegh.
3890497	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know I chose to watch this	 but now I wish I hadn't.
3890498	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Man	 I guess I now know why they say you should never meet your heroes.
3890501	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wouldn't call it a crush	 more like admiration as a fellow baseball player.
3890502	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I just looked up to him. Plus	 we came from the same hometown.
3890503	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But his ugly side‚Äîor I guess I should say	 his real personality‚Äîis something else...
3890504	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see you're having a wistful moment here	 but we should keep moving.
3890505	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're pretty far in the Palace now. The Treasure is bound to be nearby.
3890506	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	'Kay. I doubt that was the last video there is either	 so let's go.
3890507	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Voice	You'll be asked to hang up your uniform for this.
3890567	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm	 seems like Kiuchi's past is playing here as well. This must be a continuation of the story.
3890568	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Can we watch it?
3890508	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	You're supposed to be an upstanding athlete. And yet here you are sucking face in public.
3890510	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	The article even suggests you forced the girl into it. Is that true?
3890511	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	What!? No	 it's not... Probably.
3890513	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Thanks to you	 everyone in the club is having to field complaints left and right.
3890569	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Now I'm hearing all kinds of other unsavory rumors about you.
3890514	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Coach	 back me up here. This kind of conduct is indefensible	 am I wrong?
3890515	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ad Coach	You're right. There's no way around it.
3890516	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Coach...
3890517	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ad Coach	Sorry	 pal.
3890570	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ad Coach	Look	 I know you've put in a lot of effort over the years.
3890518	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	B-But... what about the majors!? I've already started the process of getting my passport and‚Äî
3890519	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Canceled. Over. Your performance is still lackluster as ever anyhow.
3890520	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Instead of worrying about that	 I suggest you start thinking about your next career path.
3890521	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I... I can't play baseball anymore...?
3890522	Team Man<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ger	I understand how much you've contributed to the organization up till now.
3890523	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	I am also aware that being an athlete is not exactly a transferable skill.
3890524	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	The sales team is looking for people	 if you'd like me to pass your name on.
3890525	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	*sniffle* *sob*
3890571	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	Oh	 get a grip! You're a grown man. Stop acting so pathetic.
3890572	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	We've even arranged to buy the public's sympathy by revealing the "cause" of your unraveling through media outlets.
3890573	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	They're going to say that after you volunteered at that baseball clinic...
3890574	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	...you "hid the fact you got injured trying to catch the batter's hit."
3890575	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
3890576	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	The baseball... clinic...
3890577	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	So what's it gonna be? You want me to cancel
the press and the sales position?
3890578	T<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>am Manager	You'll be left unemployed and publicly hated	 but...
3890526	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I'll... take the job...
3890579	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Why did this happen to me?
3890580	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Beat by a grade-school girl... Betrayed
by some escort...
3890581	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	This is their fault... Those sinister	 vile women... They did this to me!
3890582	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I'll show them... I'll show them all what it's like to be chewed up and spat out!
3890583	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I won't give them a chance to fight back	 or call for help... I'll make them see who's really in charge!
3890527	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So Kiuchi's perversion toward women drives his desire for revenge	 causing his Shadow to run amok.
3890528	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And in the real world	 it causes him to terrorize them as the Subway Slammer.
3890529	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph. What an incontrovertibly self-serving	 egoistic desire. Punishing women for problems he created himself.
3890530	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3890532	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	For so long... I agonized over what happened at that baseball clinic.
3890533	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	When I heard from those tabloids that Kiuchi got hurt because of me... I was completely depressed.
3890534	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I tortured myself... Hated myself. Threw away my reason for living along with my dreams...
3890535	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And for what!?
3890536	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A sob story made up by the press!?
3890537	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 so he solicited the public's sympathy for an injury that turned out to be fake...
3890538	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you fucking kidding me!?
3890539	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	After all the guilt those news stories made me feel...!
3890540	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I went through so much pain	 I gave up everything that was important to me in my life!
3890541	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And yet? He's running around abusing women!? With his chickenshit shoving tactics!
3890542	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just so he can lord over them and feel in control or some bullshit. Who does he think he is!?
3890543	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	O-Oh...
3890544	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll never forgive him for this!
3890584	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He's going to pay for every single person he's victimized. I'll make sure of it!
3890586	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A desire strong enough to move not just oneself	 but others as well	 hm?
3890587	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's the thing I admire most about humans. Count me in.
3711300	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're pretty far in now	 huh?
3711301	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Something about this area is extra disturbing.
3711302	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is the place. There's no mistaking it... The Treasure is here.
3711303	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But where though...? Is it only visible to you?
3711304	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not that. It just hasn't
<color=#FF423F>materialized</color> yet.
3711306	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need the Palace's ruler to do that for us.
3711307	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What...?
3711308	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're still in Kiuchi's domain. I want to avoid the enemy overhearing our plan.
3711309	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should return to the real world. We can discuss our next move there.
3711350	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 Lufel	 this materialization thing you're talking about... How are we supposed to do that?
3711351	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As the core of the ruler's desire	 the Treasure is one factor that contributes to their Shadow running rampant.
3711352	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 if the real Kiuchi doesn't think his Treasure can be stolen	 it will not materialize in the Metaverse.
3711353	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 we need to give him a reason to fear that his Treasure is at risk of being swindled.
3711354	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We need to announce to the real Kiuchi that we plan to steal his corrupted desire.
3711355	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Once we do	 the Treasure will appear in the Metaverse.
3711356	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So... We just need to tell him to his face?
3711357	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 remember we're Phantom Thieves. I'd prefer to keep our true identities under wraps.
3711358	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's more	 it's possible confronting Kiuchi directly could set him off into a frenzy.
3711360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 a calling card	 huh?
3711362	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Love it! It'll protect our identities	 and it's super Phantom Thief vibes.
3711361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agreed. Fighting evil from the cover of shadow. A phantom thief's greatest skill.
3711363	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But before we issue the calling card	 there's something I need to confirm with you two.
3711364	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Causing a change of heart is a risky act that forcibly reshapes the target's mind.
3711365	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we destroy his Shadow completely by mistake	 there's a chance the real Kiuchi could die.
3711366	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With that knowledge	 do you still want to proceed?
3711367	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um...
3890589	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 I agree.
3890590	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course I won't forgive what he's done	 but stealing his desire outright means we're no better than him.
3890591	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And the fact that one misstep by us could kill him... The thought alone freaks me out.
3890592	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have a proposition. As is customary among humans	 dire deliberations such as this should be made by unanimous decision.
3890593	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Unanimous decision?
3890594	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed.
3890595	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With anything less than the approval of every member	 we do nothing.
3890596	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not left up to the leader	 or the majority. If just one person opposes	 a unanimous decision cannot be made.
3890597	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In accomplishing matters of grave importance	 a singular	 unified heart is a sine qua non.
3890598	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right. We can't stoop to Kiuchi's level.
3890599	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I have no idea what "cynic one on" means.
3890600	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey!
3890601	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you think	 {NAME2}? Should we do it?
3890603	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmm...
3890604	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 I also have a suggestion...
3890605	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Since Tomoko's the one that got injured	 how about asking her what she thinks?
3890606	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course we'll leave out the Phantom Thieves part.
3890608	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good idea. Let's head to the station once our preparations are in order.
3890609	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on. This is the right room	 but...
3890610	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Would you two mind waiting out here?
3890612	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks.
3890613	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 you see...
3890614	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you want someone staring at you while you're all banged and bruised up? Motoha is being considerate by keeping you out.
3890615	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry	 {NAME2}.
3890677	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko	 it's me	 Motoha. I'm coming in.
3890616	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	......
3890617	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko...
3890618	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They said I can never play again.
3890619	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	My dream... it's over.
3890620	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......!
3890621	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The cops came earlier	 but...
3890622	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They said they can't arrest him unless they catch him in the act.
3890623	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I-It'll be okay	 Tomoko. Don't give up. Everything is going to get better	 I promise you.
3890624	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Your injuries will heal	 and the attacker will be cau‚Äî
3890625	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No... They won't.
3890626	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What am I supposed to live for now?
3890627	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm going to come visit you every day! So please don't‚Äî
3890628	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You don't have to. I don't want you to see me like this.
3890629	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But...
3890630	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm sorry... Motoha.
3890631	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just‚Äîthere's no point anymore... to anything...
3890632	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ngh...
3890633	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just hold on	 Tomoko. I promise you	 I'll make him pay.
3890634	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems Tomoko's hope has been stolen.
3890635	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we don't take care of Kiuchi	 people like her will continue having their will to live stripped away from them.
3890636	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've made up my mind. We have to change Kiuchi's heart.
3890637	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you guys with me?
3890639	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I am on board as well. And with that	 we've reached a unanimous decision.
3890640	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 who's going to write the calling card?
3890641	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll do it! I mean	 please let me do it.
3890642	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm the one who wants to change his heart the most	 so...
3890643	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 go ahead! Let the strength of that desire feed your creativity.
3890644	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But just for my own peace of mind	 I'll emend any clumsy wording.
3890645	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right... And "emend" means... what exactly?
3890646	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you're unfamiliar with such vocabulary	 I suppose I'll have to thoroughly school you in the basics.
3890647	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! Please do!
3890648	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Now the question is	 how do we deliver the calling card? We don't know his office or home address.
3890649	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We know he'll be around Shibuya Station	 but we don't know what days or what time.
3890650	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can help with that. I've been observing his movements throughout the day up till now.
3890651	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	At the same time every night	 Kiuchi exits the station to transfer trains.
3890652	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ooh! Nice! So we can give him the calling card then.
3890653	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 but wait. We have to give it to him in a way that he won't realize it's us	 right? How are we supposed to do that?
3890654	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's... also the part I'm struggling with.
3890655	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you think	 Leader?
3890657	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh?
3890658	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ooh! I know!
3890659	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What if Lufel flies over the station and scatters a bunch of calling cards everywhere?
3890660	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	H-Hoo!? Me?
3890661	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 yeah. I mean	 you're the one who can fly	 right?
3890662	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm bound to break a bone carrying this much weight!
3890663	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's highly improbable I would go unnoticed	
thus jeopardizing the Phantom Thieves'
name along with my physical well-being.
3890664	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 what are you worried about? This is the best way to guarantee Kiuchi gets the message!
3890665	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very well... This is our first mission after all.
3890666	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose we might as well make a statement
and let the world know who the Subway Slammer
really is.
3890667	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll come up with a design for the card. Let everyone have a taste of the Metaverse's rakish charm.
3890668	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But we must be careful. The calling card will
only reveal the Treasure for a day.
That means	 once we send it...
3890669	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll have to steal the Treasure that day.
We can build up our experience in Mementos
first. Let me know when you're ready.
3890670	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you ready? Once the calling card is sent	 there's no turning back.
3890671	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In other words	 we can't return until we've made Kiuchi have a change of heart.
3700772	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we need to do any shopping	 we should get it done before we go. So	 are you ready to send the calling card?
3700615	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Understood. We make our move tonight.
3700617	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Understood. Once you're prepared	 give me a hoot.
3890672	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Sir Takeyuki Kiuchi, former baseball player, sinner of lust, known today as the Subway Slammer.
3890673	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	You have assaulted countless women at the station with outrageous acts of violence.
3890674	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	You are a coward who preys on the unsuspecting and defenseless, stealing their hopes away from them.
3890675	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	We, the Phantom Thieves, will take your twisted desires without fail.
3890676	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	What the hell is this!?
3890678	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	The Phantom Thieves? Who the hell‚Äî!? They even wrote my name!
3890679	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Man	Kiuchi? Oh	 there was some player with that name.
3890680	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Baseball Aficionado	I remember that guy. He has a long	 oval-shaped head and...
3890681	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Baseball Aficionado	Huh?
3890682	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Baseball Aficionado	Wait	 isn't that him right there?
3890683	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	*gasp*
3890684	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Get out of my way	 idiots!
3890685	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	The Phantom Thieves, huh? You think you can steal from me!?
3890686	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Yeah	 right! Like you could! If I lost that	 I'd...!
3890687	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 Kiuchi definitely saw the calling card. The Treasure should have materialized now.
3890688	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no turning back now. Let's enter Mementos.
3711700	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Before we steal Kiuchi's Treasure	 let's make sure we're all on the same page.
3711702	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My memories are not 100% clear	 so this will
border on‚Äîif not surpass‚Äîspeculation	 but...
3711703	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is a possibility that once we steal the root of Kiuchi's desire	 meaning the Treasure	 his Palace will disappear.
3711704	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Disappear? So	 after we steal the Treasure	 we can never go back to the Palace?
3711705	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've never made a Palace disappear before	 so I can't imagine what happens after that.
3711706	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is it possible	 for one reason or another	 that the Palace might appear again?
3711707	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't say for certain one way or the other	 but there is a non-zero possibility.
3711709	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right!
3890689	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	First	 let's focus all our energy on stealing that Treasure! Kiuchi's bound to put up a fight after all.
3711710	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As long as we're in agreement about the Palace	 it's fine by me. Let's go.
3711400	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 it looks so different from last time.
3711401	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Well	 look who it is! The maggots that do their dirty work in the dark!
3890545	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi!
3890546	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait... is that a ball behind him?
3711403	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's it! That's the Treasure!
3711404	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's the Treasure? The thing that caused his messed-up desires?
3711405	Shadow <#000000	K	#FFFFFF>iuchi	Hey! What are you mumbling over there	 huh!?
3890690	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	You saw what happened in my past	 yet still don't show an ounce of remorse	 do you	 Motoha Arai?
3890691	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	You're just a cold-hearted monster of a woman	 aren't you?
3890692	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Look who's talking! The guy who faked an injury from a children's baseball clinic?
3890693	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All you do is point the finger because you can't face up to your own issues. You're a coward.
3890694	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	You... goddamn brat!
3711406	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	You were a brat back then too. A cheeky little freak running around like you didn't give a damn.
3711407	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I am Takeyuki Kiuchi! The great Takeyuki Kiuchi-sama!
3711408	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	So why am I stuck being some worthless office worker?
3890695	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Shut up! What do you brats know about anything!?
3890696	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Women these days up on their high horses cry
sexual harassment the second you try to talk
to them.
3711410	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	And I'm only worth as much as my salary
to them!
3711411	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	The reason I ended up like this... everything...
It's all because of women! Despite the fact
they're completely useless without men!
3711417	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Guess we really have to do it.
3711412	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right. But remember	 our goal is stealing the Treasure.
3711413	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To do that we'll have to pin him down first. Are you ready?
3711415	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We've come this far. Time to end this!
3711416	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Come and get it	 you sticky-mitted rug rats.
3890697	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	The game's not over till you're all crying for mercy!
3711450	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	How do you like these muscles?
3890698	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I might be retired	 but I kept up the training!
3890699	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Now I'm gonna crush you snot-nosed brats down to size!
3711451	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Like I said	 first we need to impair him. Then	 we'll distract him and take the Treasure!
3711452	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just be careful not to finish him off	 or the real Kiuchi might die.
3711453	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So just beat the hell out of him	 right? Got it!
3711470	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Agh... You damn‚Äî!
3711471	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's over. We have no intention of killing you.
3711472	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Once we take that Treasure from behind you	 we'll be on our way.
3711474	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	...!?
3711475	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	S-Stop it! That's mine!
3711476	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 well that makes me want it all the more.
3711477	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now! Take the Treasure!
3711512	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	No! You can't!
3711513	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I won't let you have it!
3711514	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What is that!?
3711515	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	It's too early to call the game!
3711516	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	This isn't over till the bottom of the ninth. But you won't get a chance at a walk-off home run!
3711517	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	'Cause Cupid's breaking ball's gonna crush everything to dust!
3711560	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Hahahahaha. You thought you could corner me? Well look who's cornered now!
3711561	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	I'm done going easy on you! Now I'll crush you like the bugs you are!
3711562	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He's revealed his true form!
3890700	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But the plan stays the same! Dodge Kiuchi and go for the Treasure!
3711563	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Woo! I feel as good as I did in my league days. How 'bout a li'l charm 'n' cheer?
3711565	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Yes! That's it! Shake it for me! Shower me with praise!
3711566	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Those women are making Kiuchi stronger.
3890701	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should consider taking them out first.
3711567	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Kiuchi's gaining power from those women!
3711568	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 prioritizing your targets is critical!
3711569	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Goddamn it. Women really are useless!
3711570	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Gahaha! You better give me what I want!
3711571	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Here comes my strike-stealing	 heart-breaking pitch!
3711572	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Tsk! This is what's wrong with women!
3711573	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Gahaha! All eyes on me!
3711574	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	I've gotten more money and women with this arm than I can even count!
3711575	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Someone's always getting in my way!
3711577	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Hey! Bring me girls! Where are the girls!?
3711578	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like he's distracted. Now we can steal the Treasure.
3711579	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Leave it to me.
3711580	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take us home	 Closer.
3711583	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Huuuh? One's missing...
3711584	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is the Treasure that stole Tomoko's dream away from her!
3711585	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	W-When did you‚Äî!?
3711586	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	No! Not that! It's my‚Äî!
3711587	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haaaayah!
3711588	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>pid	Gaagh!
3711610	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He went back to his original form?
3890702	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That means we've stopped his Shadow's frenzy. He doesn't have the power to resist anymore.
3890703	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What should we do	 Wonder?
3890705	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Ugn!
3890706	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	No! I can't move!
3890707	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I'm ruined... I can never play again... Just take it.
3711611	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You may be the enemy	 but your attachment to your Treasure... Well	 I appreciate the strength of that desire.
3711612	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is...
3711613	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi.
3711614	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're going to pay for every single person you've hurt through your crimes.
3711615	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Motoha... Arai...
3890548	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Heh... Heheh...
3890549	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	My life... It's pathetic. Working a desk job while obsessing over my old baseball career...
3890550	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I couldn't make anything go right... Then I started doing something that awful...
3890551	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	My life... There's nothing left for me to live for. How am I supposed to go on living...?
3890552	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3890553	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Get a grip!
3890554	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Huh...?
3890555	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	What? You gonna beat me up again? I can't move anymore	 and I have no reason to live eith‚Äî
3890556	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No! I'm saying	 wake up!
3890557	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Wha...
3890558	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know what your problem is?
3890559	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You treat women like they're dolls for you to lord over. But they're not. They're human beings.
3890560	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You've spent your life taking advantage of as
many women as you possibly could	 and somehow
it's their fault your life is crap?
3890708	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's bullshit!
3890709	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What did any of the women you victimized do to you? What did Tomoko ever do to you!?
3890710	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You have hurt a lot of innocent people. Stolen their hope away from them...
3890711	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What happened to the Takeyuki Kiuchi that made us all love baseball!?
3890712	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	*gasp*
3890713	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't say you have nothing to live for.
3890714	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There are a lot of people who discovered their dreams... their reasons for living	 because of you.
3890715	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	To them	 you were always a hero... a star they looked up to.
3890716	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Hero...?
3890717	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What you've done is unforgivable. But that
doesn't mean your life is over.
3890718	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	As long as you're alive	 no matter what shape that life takes	 your hopes	 your dreams	 will never die.
3890719	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	But... there's no way I can go back to being a pro...
3890720	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that really... your only dream?
3890721	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Huh?
3890722	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Before your whole fixation on women	 why did you start playing baseball in the first place?
3890723	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Because... I loved it.
3890724	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I used to play in the park as a kid. Everyone would praise me for my good plays.
3890725	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Then when the girl I liked finally talked to me... That's when I got into this messed up mindset...
3890726	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	For once in my life	 things were going well for me... and I saw a new reason to live.
3890727	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you really did start out with a love for baseball...
3890728	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then you can rebuild that dream again.
3890729	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Huh?
3890730	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	After you atone for your crimes	 and reflect on what you've done...
3890731	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What about becoming a little league coach	 and helping kids achieve their baseball dreams?
3890732	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	To make up for all the hopes you crushed as the Subway Slammer	 you should inspire dreams in as many people as possible.
3890733	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	I... can't. I don't have the skill to teach any‚Äî
3890734	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You can.
3890735	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You were the one who gave me my dream.
3890736	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	......!
3890737	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	Really...? How did I get so turned around?
3890738	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Kiuchi	This feeling... I'm going to make sure I...
3711620	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He vanished? What about the change of heart? Cattle?
3711621	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is supposed to be Kiuchi's desire? What does it mean?
3711622	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's happening!?
3711623	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Grab the Treasure and run!
3890739	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that we've taken its source of power	 the Palace is going to disappear!
3711624	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Seriously!? Okay! Wonder	 grab that end! Wait	 is this even gonna fit inside... Cattle?
3711627	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I appreciate your desire for Treasure	 but... just watch the upholstery.
3711660	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew! We made it.
3711661	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Where's the Treasure!?
3711662	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here.
3711663	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That looks nothing like what we took from the Palace.
3890740	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This was the origin of Kiuchi's corrupted desires.
3890741	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In the Palace	 Kiuchi's cognition interpreted
it as a trophy to cherish. Now it's out here	
it has returned to its original form.
3890742	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh...
3890743	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So his love for baseball	 his lust for women	 and his resentment against them...
3890744	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...all started with this ball.
3890746	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks. You and Lufel were great too!
3890747	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I really hope that with this	 we can make Tomoko feel better. Even if it's just a little bit.
3890748	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh... I wouldn't say cool. If anything	 it felt like I was lecturing him...
3890749	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I'm glad I came across like that. Thank you.
3711664	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	L-Lunch was ages ago! And we've been running around a lot.
3711665	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In that case	 how about a celebratory dinner? There's some information I want to share with you two as well.
3711666	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay! There's this place in <color=#FF423F>Shinjuku</color> I've
been wanting to try. Let's go there.
3711667	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have great confidence in Motoha's choice of dining establishments. Let's go.
3711668	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 look! That's...!
3890561	Passerby A	He asked someone to call the cops on him?
3890562	Passerby B	Wait	 isn't that the ex-baseball player Kiuchi?
3890563	Passerby C	So the Subway Slammer Menace... was him?
3890564	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears the change of heart was successful.
3890750	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So... he turned himself in because we changed his heart?
3890751	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. Only the memories of his crimes remain.
He'll likely confess to everything	 including
his misdeeds as the Subway Slammer.
3890753	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmmm...
3890754	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I was thinking... I mean	 of course his actions were unforgiveable	 but...
3890755	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm just glad it didn't go any further than it did	 you know?
3890756	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	Ahahahahahahaha!
3890757	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	I... I killed them. I'm a murderer!
3890758	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>keyuki Kiuchi	This is it... There's no turning back now!
3890760	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Alright	 then let's go. The place was in Shinjuku	 right	 Motoha?
3890761	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 this way! Follow me.
3890764	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey! You're staring into space again. Motoha's waiting. Let's go.
3894000	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So this ball was the root of Kiuchi's twisted desires	 huh? Seems like the kind of thing anyone would have lying around...
3894001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do you think if we took a wrong turn somewhere	 we'd end up corrupt Palace rulers like Kiuchi?
3894002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	While it's not beyond the realm of possibility	 I don't think the two of you have it in you.
3894003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By awakening your Personas	 you faced the Shadows embodying your desire head-on.
3894004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You took Kiuchi's desires and induced his change of heart not for yourselves	 but for the sake of others.
3894005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By doing so	 you safeguarded the hopes and dreams of many	 and with it	 their will to live.
3894006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To imagine that unshakeable goodwill you possess turning to cruelty... Well	 frankly I can't.
3894007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha... It makes us sound so cool when you say it like that...
3894008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But	 yeah. I guess we did do something pretty great	 huh?
3894009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed.
3894010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And it seems you two have an even stronger influence on hope than I initially thought.
3894012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The people you've helped	 and even Kiuchi	 whose heart you changed... they all seem to have renewed desire for life.
3894013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not that a monster like him deserves our compassion in the first place.
3894014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're probably right	 but...
3894015	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Messing up is just part of being human. Obviously Kiuchi's no exception to that... but neither am I.
3894016	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The choice to throw away hope will always be our own to make. I wanted him to realize that.
3894017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3894018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But {NAME2} was the one who taught me that! Hahaha.
3894020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What	 you didn't realize!?
3894021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks to you	 Tomoko and I can now start moving forward.
3894030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Speaking of	 are you sure you don't want to share the news with Tomoko Noge?
3894031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 yeah.
3894032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Visiting hours are over for today	 so I'm gonna go tell her tomorrow.
3894033	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hopefully hearing that the bad guy's been caught will make her feel at least a little bit better.
3894034	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 by the way	 how's your memory	 Lufel? Has the Treasure helped you remember anything?
3894035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. When I touched Kiuchi's Treasure	 my memories came back to me. At least fragments of them did.
3894036	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow! That's great!
3894037	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 wait. By "fragments" do you mean not all of them came back?
3894038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Unfortunately.
3894039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I plan to explain in more detail when we discuss the information I have to share with you.
3894040	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh that's right	 you said you had something to tell us.
3894041	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is it related to what's happening with your memories?
3894042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is correct.
3894043	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But right now we're in the afterglow of our triumph over Kiuchi. I'd hate to spoil it with what I have to say.
3894044	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What!? When you say it all ominous like that I feel like I have to know! Right	 {NAME2}?
3894046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph. More of that irrepressible curiosity	 is it? I suppose I have to tell you then.
3894047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you for real? I'm the weird one?
3894048	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 I can't take it! Just clue us in a little.
3894049	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph. More of that irrepressible curiosity	 is it? I suppose I have to tell you then.
3894022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are more <color=#FF423F>Treasures</color>.
3894023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3894024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From what I am able to recall	 there are
<color=#FF423F>seven</color> Treasures in total. Which would mean...
3894026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely.
3894027	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî Uh... Wait. So...
3894050	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There are six more people running around scot-free	 wreaking havoc like Kiuchi?
3894051	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Correct.
3894028	Train Announcement	The next station is Shinjuku. The exit will be on...
3894029	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 I guess let's get off the train first.
3894071	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So uhhh	 let's table the Treasure talk for now...
3894072	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...and head to the restaurant first! I'm sooo hungry.
3894073	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Soooo hungry!
3894074	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is the most motivated I've ever seen you.
3894075	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose appetite is another form of human desire. On that note	 what kind of restaurant are we going to?
3894076	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's a ramen shop. Back in little league	 I always went there to celebrate after winning a game.
3894077	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 so that makes it the perfect spot for our celebratory dinner.
3894078	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right!? I heard they recently changed their recipe and had a grand reopening! I can't wait to try it!
3894079	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And since you helped me get justice for Tomoko	 today's my treat!
3894081	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	My pleasure! Feel free to go for the large size with extra toppings!
3894092	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course! Feel free to go for the large size with extra toppings!
3894082	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Toppings? Does that refer to the side foods that complement the main dish?
3894083	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! Like boiled eggs	 or roasted pork... So how do you like your ramen	 {NAME2}?
3894085	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! A fellow meat lover!
3894086	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You have good taste... Mmmm... Good choice.
3894087	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oooh	 a festival of yummy carbs! I like your style	 Leader!
3894088	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fan of quantity over quality I see. Well	 it's still a respectable desire at that.
3894089	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	P-Plain!? We're talking about ramen here!
3894090	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You may be free to make your own choices	
but perhaps you should take a page out of
Motoha's book when it comes to food.
3894091	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Aaagh	 the more we stand around talking about it the hungrier I get! Let's get this ramen train movin'!
3894135	Fortune <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>eller	Um! Excuse me!
3894136	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	Your endeavors to seek what you crave
will lead to misfortune. I can see it on
your faces.
3894137	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	You should go home and head straight to bed!
3894150	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3894138	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But we're just on our way to get dinner...
3894139	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	Dinner... A food craving!? It's worse than I thought!
3894140	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	Trying to sate your hunger will only lead to disaster. I see it in your aura.
3894142	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	I can tell you everything if you allow me to
<color=#FF423F>read your fortune</color>!
3894143	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whaaat? I'm not sure about all this...
3894144	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Come on	 let's go eat. She's just making broad guesses that could apply to anyone.
3894145	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I commend the strength of her desire to lure us in	 but I suggest we keep moving.
3894151	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah... I am really starving.
3894146	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	If you don't get a reading you can't protect yourselves! My predictions always come true!
3894147	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha... Sorry	 we're kinda in a hurry so...
3894148	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	Oh... I see. Forgive me.
3894149	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	I'm closing up for today	 but if you ever need a glimpse into the future	 I'll be right here.
3894152	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rtune Teller	Farewell then.
3894200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're here! This is it!
3894201	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	<color=#FF423F>Victory Kitchen</color>... Well	 it certainly
has character.
3894202	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right!? Apparently it's a branch of a popular Chinese restaurant that specializes in ramen.
3894203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Lots of young chefs come here to study the art of ramen making.
3894204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wow	 you know quite a lot about this place.
3894205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha... What can I say? I love ramen. Well	 all food really...
3894207	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There was a time when their ratings dropped	 but word has it that they bounced back with tastier dishes after the reopening.
3894208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They certainly seem to be doing well.
3894209	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 it's crowded	 but looks like a table just opened up! "Misfortune" my foot! This is our lucky day!
3894206	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's go in!
3894250	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I got the shoyu ramen too! The sign said that one's recommended.
3894251	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I figured it's probably hard for you to eat noodles	 Lufel	 so I made sure to get lots of toppings suitable for pecking.
3894252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's boiled eggs and roasted pork too	 so I've covered our bases!
3894253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent choice.
3894254	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I would've gotten gyoza too if they had it...
3894256	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So where did we leave off talking before?
3894257	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right	 we were discussing the remaining Treasures.
3894258	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So there're seven Treasures in total	 meaning we have six left to find?
3894259	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely.
3894260	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I know you two already fulfilled the job I asked of you by stealing Kiuchi's Treasure.
3894261	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 what I can discern from my most
recent recollections tells me that we ought to
consider our <color=#FF423F>next course of action</color>.
3894262	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Next course of action? Does that mean you want us to...
3894264	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm glad you understand.
3894265	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh...
3894266	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So we have to pull some phantom thievery and steal another six Treasures.
3894267	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I know what you must be thinking. You
already put your lives at risk once	 and here
I am asking you to do it six more times.
3894268	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's why I wanted to ask you both whether you're willing to continue working as phantom thieves or not.
3894269	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess when we formed the Phantom Thieves	 I was so focused on stopping Kiuchi...
3894270	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...I didn't think about anything beyond the change of heart.
3894271	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you think	 {NAME2}? Do you feel equipped to continue the Phantom Thieves?
3894272	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The world may be losing hope	 but it's not going to descend into ruin immediately.
3894273	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The will to determine that outcome rests with you.
3894275	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	However	 if you find ruin an unsavory fate...
3894276	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	...you would do best to seek other allies of hope	 and nurture the desire within your heart.
3894279	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I certainly have no intention of forcing you into it.
3894280	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No matter what	 staying true to your desires is paramount.
3894281	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 I guess I already accomplished my goal when we changed Kiuchi's heart and avenged Tomoko. But...
3894282	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Quitting... Giving up the Phantom Thieves...
3894283	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	Two deluxe shoyu ramens! Order up!
3894284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know we're in the middle of an important discussion	 but... shall we dig in?
3894285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*salivate* All right	 agreed. I suppose we can consider this our victory feast.
3894286	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If I may	 I'd first just like to say a few words on behalf of the group...
3894287	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's eat!
3894288	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh well	 no matter. You should start eating while it's still hot	 {NAME2}.
3894289	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm...?
3894290	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? I don't remember it tasting like this.
3894292	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry	 just thinking out loud.
3894293	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It just kind of seems like the flavor is a lot weaker than it was before.
3894294	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It sort of tastes like... fish broth? Maybe bonito? I can't be sure... It's pretty indistinct.
3894295	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But	 I'm probably just remembering it wrong. It's been a long time since I last had it.
3894296	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you two wouldn't mind	 I'd like to have a bite to eat myself at some point too	 you know.
3894297	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh right	 sorry! I guess you can't hold chopsticks.
3894298	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on... is it okay for owls to eat eggs and stuff?
3894299	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My appearance is just a disguise to help me blend into this world. Therefore	 it has no bearing on what I'm able to eat.
3894300	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But much like a bird of prey	 I'll call the eggs an appetizer...
3894301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...to the meaty main course!
3894302	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haha... Guess we know what Lufel's favorite is.
3894303	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 here comes the boiled egg. Open wide!
3894304	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ahh! It's hot!
3894305	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh my god! Sorry! Are you guys okay?
3894307	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait... Could this be the "dinner disaster"!?
3894308	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>arp-Eyed Youth	No...
3894309	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>arp-Eyed Youth	Masa-san	 are you really satisfied with this?
3894310	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee Called Masa	Shun...
3894311	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm? That uniform...
3894312	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Called Shun	It's nothing like the broth you worked so hard to perfect.
3894313	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Called Shun	This is not Pops's flavor!
3894314	Empl<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>yee Called Masa	Try to understand	 Shun.
3894315	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee Called Masa	I'm not happy about this either.
3894316	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Called Shun	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
3894317	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Was that... Kano-kun just now?
3894318	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Kano? An acquaintance of yours?
3894319	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've barely spoken to him before	 but I'm
pretty sure he's in Class D with Tomoko...
Oh yeah	 his name's <color=#FF423F>Shun Kano</color>.
3894320	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like he knows the people who run the shop.
3894321	C<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eepy Voice	Masa-chaaan	 baby! How. Are. You?
3894322	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I'm sorry	 it's not closing time yet.
3894323	S<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>irking Man	We wrapped filming at our other location ahead of schedule. I know I'm a tad early	 but I'm here now	 so...
3894324	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But...
3894325	S<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>irking Man	Hey hey hey... Hey hey hey!
3894326	S<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>irking Man	Look	 I've got places to be. You're not telling me to wait	 are you?
3894327	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Uh... no...
3894328	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I'm so sorry	 everyone. We'll be closing up early today.
3894329	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whaaat!?
3894330	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Office Worker	Hey! That's ridiculous!
3894331	Middle-Aged Office Worker	I just started eating!
3894332	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I'm sorry	 I truly am. I'll refund you in full.
3894333	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	We look forward to serving you again!
3894334	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well this sucks	 but I guess we should be going too. The chef's apologizing and everything...
3894335	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But...! But...!
3894336	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm?
3894337	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My meat!
3894345	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Office Worker	That was really good. Well	 the few bites we managed to have were. No wonder Miyazawa gave this place such a great review.
3894346	Middle-aged Office Worker	Hmmm... really? I felt like the soup was missing something.
3894347	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Office Worker	No way. THE <color=#FF423F>Hiromu Miyazawa</color> swears by
this place. Subtle flavor means it's refined!
3894348	Middle-aged Office Worker	Oh	 is that it? Guess you're probably right.
3894349	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course! That guy in there was Hiromu Miyazawa!
3894351	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You haven't heard of him? Gourmet Food Critic Hiromu Miyazawa? He's on TV all the time.
3894352	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ahhh	 so approval from a celebrity critic made the shop famous?
3894353	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 exactly. He goes by "Katana Tongue" something or other. His palate is said to be unquestionable.
3894354	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I don't know	 I think the old Victory Kitchen tasted better.
3894355	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's Voice	You think so too	 huh?
3894356	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What...?
3894357	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah	 sorry for butting in.
3894358	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No	 it's cool. Um... You're Kano-kun	 right?
3894359	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm Motoha Arai from Class C.
3894360	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's Ms. Katayama's class	 isn't it?
3894361	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I've seen you around school a few times too.
3894363	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right. My name's Shun Kano. Nice to meet ya.
3894364	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 you're {PLAYER_NAME}-kun	 aren't you?
3894365	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're kind of a weird dude	 huh? Whatever	
it's cool. My name's Shun Kano.
Nice to meet ya.
3894366	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You were talking with the chef before	 weren't you? Do you know him or something?
3894367	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well...
3894368	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 not really.
3894369	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You mentioned the ramen before... What'd you
really think of it?
3894370	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ummm... If I'm being honest	 it was... mediocre.
3894371	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I remember back when I was a kid	 I used to really love the soup	 but I wasn't really feeling it this time.
3894372	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I see... I was afraid you'd say that...
3894374	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sorry for asking out of the blue. It's really nothin'.
3894375	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Later.
3894376	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What? Wait!
3894377	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He just left... I wonder what that was about.
3894378	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Aaah! Those measly few bites have only made me feel even hungrier!
3894379	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Scalded by an egg	 kicked out halfway through	 meat uneaten I may add...! Some celebration this turned out to be.
3894380	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And I splashed soup in {NAME2}'s eyes... Sorry	 I shouldn't have suggested this place.
3894382	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess that "dinner disaster" fortune turned out to be true.
3894383	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's call it a day. We're all tired	 and I'm sure we'll find something to eat at home.
3894384	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph	 all right.
3894385	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But we are absolutely buying meat on the way back. It is not up for debate!
3894386	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're really obsessed	 huh?
3894387	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 and Lufel? About our next job...
3894388	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are all Palace rulers bad people?
3894389	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Bad people willing to step on anyone in
pursuit of their own twisted desires.
It's exactly as you said.
3894390	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And if we steal their Treasures	 we can change their hearts?
3894391	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Based on what happened to Kiuchi it would seem that way. Even I cannot say for sure whether he confessed to the police.
3894392	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmm...
3894393	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 sorry. Let's actually go home. I didn't mean to rekindle the conversation.
3894394	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 see you tomorrow!
3894395	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 shall we head home as well?
3894396	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't know whether you're still interested
in being a Phantom Thief... but I assume you
don't mind if I still stay the night?
3894398	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Thank you. Apologies for the inconvenience.
3894430	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey. It's Motoha. Sorry to call so late. Can you turn on your TV right now?
3894432	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's Kiuchi... he's on the news!
3894450	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wscaster	...The arrest was made when Kiuchi	 the suspect himself	 asked a nearby man to report him to the police.
3894452	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm listening. Yeah	 it's that news. I'm watching it too.
3894453	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wscaster	The suspect claims in his statement to the police...
3894454	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wscaster	...that he "felt as if the evil in his heart was suddenly lifted away."
3894455	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wscaster	Unable to bear the weight of his own conscience	 Kiuchi confessed to further offenses.
3894456	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's exactly like Lufel said. This is the change of heart.
3894457	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wscaster	Here is a comment from one of the victims.
3894458	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Victim	There's nothing you can do to protect yourself from a sudden attack like that. I felt completely powerless.
3894459	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Victim	But knowing that from tomorrow	 I can step foot in the station without that hanging over me... makes me so relieved.
3894460	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes!
3894461	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Feels great to hear that we managed to have such an impact on someone we don't even know.
3894462	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right now	 there are more bad people out there like Kiuchi going ignored by police...
3894463	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And there are others like Tomoko and the girl
on TV	 who go through all that suffering only
to think giving up is the only option.
3894464	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But if the Phantom Thieves were to do something... No. The Phantom Thieves are the only ones who can do something.
3894465	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's exactly right.
3894466	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can recover the hopes of victims being exploited by these outrageous acts.
3894467	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wscaster	Now	 with regard to the documents reportedly
scattered above Shibuya Station and signed
by the so-called "Phantom Thieves..."
3894468	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah! Are they talking about the calling cards!?
3894469	Ne<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>scaster	The documents in question expressed an
intention to "steal the suspect Kiuchi's
desires	 leading police to believe...
3894470,N<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>wscaster,...they held a connection to the ongoing case.
However, based on eyewitness reports that the
documents were dropped by a wild bird...
3894471,N<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>wscaster,...police have ruled them out as having any connection to the case at hand, calling it a random occurrence."
3894472	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What? They think a wild bird just happened to... That's insane.
3894473	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Witnesses? I was too careless.
3894474	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll be more careful next ti‚Äî Oh	 wait.
3894475	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I still don't know if there'll be a next time for you two...
3894476	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
3894477	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 Lufel? I know this incident was written off as a coincidence...
3894478	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But if the Phantom Thieves become well-known	 would that mean we could save more people?
3894479	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right. The number of victims would certainly
decrease for starters. And if Menaces began
to fear the Phantom Thieves...
3894480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...they'll cease acting on their twisted impulses and this problem will finally come to an end.
3894481	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Yeah	 that could work.
3894482	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you think	 {NAME2}? Should we continue the Phantom Thieves?
3894484	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh?
3894485	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 I knew you'd say that!
3894486	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Average students by day	 phantom thieves
defending desire by night.
3894487	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sounds pretty cool when you put it like that	 huh!? Like we're making the world a better place.
3894488	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahhh... Anyway	 it's getting late	 so I'll leave you with this...
3894489	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's do this thing!
3894490	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	R-Right...
3894491	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah! Sorry	 was that too loud? Eheheh... Sorry to make a racket! 'Night!
3894492	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That Motoha... If this were the Metaverse we'd be up to our beaks in enemies right now.
3894493	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But	 for a person to be as willing to face danger head-on as she...
3894494	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps this world isn't quite as hopeless as we'd imagined...
3894495	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Um	 never mind	 sorry. I'm still having difficulty parsing my returning memories.
3894496	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyway	 {NAME2}. As members of the Phantom Thieves	 I look forward to completing our next job together.
3894499	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But to think I was spotted distributing the calling cards...
3894500	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I fear my presence could risk unmasking your identity as a phantom thief.
3894501	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need to think of a new method for delivering the next calling card.
3894535	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Mmmm	 this bonito broth is second to none. This is the true taste of Victory Kitchen.
3894536	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	A light soup that packs a punch with its refined	 citrusy aftertaste!
3894537	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	It'll leave your tastebuds begging for more with every sip!
3894538	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I'm sure you all remember the time when this shop was in crisis.
3894539	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The founder	 affectionately known as Pops	
fell very ill... Ever since	 the quality of
their flavor has dropped significantly.
3894540	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	But then! I	 Katana Tongue Miyazawa	 whipped this place into shape!
3894541	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh	 the number of bad reviews I had to give them. But of course	 I did so with the good of Victory Kitchen in mind.
3894542	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Though some people out there like to call me a "Menace" for it.
3894543	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	But I don't mind playing the villain if it means protecting true flavor!
3894544	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And it seems my feelings finally got through
to them	 as I eventually earned the
wholehearted support of the young chefs!
3894545	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	We worked together to revive the broth to its
original‚Äî No. We've surpassed the old flavor
to reach new heights of excellence!
3894546	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ahhh	 remembering all this makes me so emotional... The soup seems somehow saltier than usual	 hahah.
3894547	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That's all for tonight's Stupidly Honest
Review with Miyazawa-kun	 where I tell ya the
who's who and what's what in food biz.
3894548	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Brought to you from Victory Kitchen. With the
might of my pen	 I cut through bad taste
cleaner than any sword!
3894549	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	This is Katana Tongue Miyazawa signing off. G'night	 everybody!
3894550	T<#000000	V	#FFFFFF> Station Staff	Okay	 that's a wrap!
3894551	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Excellent work	 Miyazawa-san!
3894552	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ugh	 putting on that stupid act is
exhausting. Tomorrow's that hole-in-the-wall
Chinese food place	 right?
3894553	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Yes	 that's right. You'll be reviewing
<color=#FF423F>Heritage Kitchen</color> in Zoshigaya.
3894554	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ahhh yes. The main shop Victory Kitchen branched off from... Pops's place.
3894555	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Since Pops got sick	 it seems the part-time staff are struggling to keep the business afloat...
3894556	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	But that doesn't mean I should pull any punches. After all	 it has nothing to do with flavor	 right?
3894557	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	*gasp*
3894558	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Uh oh! I wonder if I'll be called a Menace again. It is so hard being a popular	 straight-shooting gourmet critic.
3894559	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	What	 Masa-kun? You look like you have something to say.
3894560	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	How about we see some appreciation first	 huh?
3894561	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	......
3894562	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That's right! Let's preserve the integrity of Victory Kitchen together.
3894563	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Please	 enough is enough.
3894564	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I can't stand lying to our customers like this...
3894565	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Excuse me? Did I hear that correctly?
3894566	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Using my bonito flakes has cut down your expenses and labor costs.
3894567	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And thanks to promotion by me	 this place has been crawling with customers! Everyone's raving about the taste!
3894568	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	B-But	 Pops's flavor requires authentic bonito flakes grated by hand with a shaver box...
3894569	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Shaver box!? You don't need those stinky old cheese graters!
3894570	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The customers are clearly satisfied with my
budget bonito flakes. So what is it really?
3894571	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Dying for another one of my scathing reviews
to cut your little shop down to size till it
goes under for good?
3894572	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	N-No	 I...
3894573	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I can see us setting up a whole chain in the
not too distant future. I know old
<color=#FF423F>Pops Yamagoshi-san</color> will be pleased!
3894574	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	......
3894575	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	By the way...
3894576	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I thought you made sure to fire that little rat who splashed water in my face	 didn't you?
3894577	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And yet	 he passed right by me when I walked in here. Don't tell me you're letting him come and go as he pleases?
3894578	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Anyone's allowed as a customer.
3894579	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hmph... Well	 whatever.
3700001	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	But you should be careful. 'Cause your entire shop's riding on you keeping me a happy camper. Got it?
3700008	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	......
3894580	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 you're up. You have school today	 don't you? I'll be waiting downstairs.
3894581	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you heading to school? I shall be
waiting downstairs.
3894583	Mother	Good morning! It's morning there	 isn't it?
3894584	Mother	How are you doing?
3894585	Mother	I'm just a bit worried about you since we won't be back for a while.
3894587	Mother	Make sure you're eating enough	 okay?
3894600	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh! Good morning	 {NAME2}-chan!
3894601	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Are you feeling all right?
3894603	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well if you start to feel sick at all	 make sure you go to the doctor	 okay?
3894604	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I know how you men are about going
to the doctor. My hubby just hates it.
3894606	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Speaking of doctors	 do you know about the clinic in Yongen?
3894608	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's called <color=#FF423F>Takemi Medical Clinic</color>...
3894609	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This is just a rumor	 but I hear that if the doctor there likes you	 she'll give you prescriptions for strong medicine.
3894611	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Battling Shadows is an inevitable part of our
ongoing efforts. Having effective medicine on
hand would provide peace of mind.
3894612	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But considering the challenges we're bound
to face in the Metaverse	 I'd rather prepare
a way to access medicine and treatment.
3894623	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Word on the street says Menaces are lurking
around every corner. At least with strong
medicine you can relax a little	 right?
3894613	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wait... Would medicine actually help with that?
3894614	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Silly me! I actually don't really get this whole Menace thing!
3894615	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Anyway	 so about this clinic...
3894616	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I'm sorry! Look at me just gabbing away. You'll be late for school!
3894617	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Have a nice day	 sweety!
3894622	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	She certainly seems to enjoy your company. Now then	 shall we head to school?
3894618	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	No way! "Temporarily closed"?
3894619	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But I wanted to come here with my hubby for beer and gyoza tonight...
3894650	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>formed Man	Hey	 you see the news yesterday? They said the Subway Slammer was an ex-baseball star!
3894651	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ssip-Loving Man	Yes I saw it! The Subway Slammer's that Menace everyone's talking about on the Divine Justice website.
3894652	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>mid High School Girl	That Kiuchi guy	 or whatever his name was... I've actually been shoved by him before.
3894653	E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ergetic Female Student	Really!? That must've been hard... But now that they caught him you can rest easy!
3894654	E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ergetic Female Student	Oh by the way	 did you hear about that "calling card" thing scattered around in Shibuya?
3894655	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>mid High School Girl	Uhh	 the Phantom Thieves or something	 right? Saying they planned to steal Kiuchi's desires...
3894656	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>mid High School Girl	But they said on the news it was just trash from some bird. It doesn't have anything to do with the case.
3894657	Station Announcement	The next station is Shimo-Kitazawa. The exit will be on...
3894670	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Morning	 you two!
3894687	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good morning.
3894671	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm really glad you said yes to continuing the Phantom Thieves yesterday.
3894673	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No	 really	 thank you. You really saved me and Tomoko.
3894674	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 come on. I'd be totally freaked if I had to go it alone. It's good knowing you've got my back.
3894675	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha. I see you're in a good mood today. Something good happen?
3894676	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Both of you agreeing to continue is a big relief for me as well. Two business partners are certainly better than one.
3894677	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Business partners sounds pretty stuffy. Don't you think "teammates" has a better ring to it?
3894678	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm? Uh	 well	 I suppose...
3894679	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And it's not like we're just colleagues. After all	 you're living with {NAME2}	 Lufel.
3894680	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If I told my parents I wanted a pet owl	 they'd never allow it.
3894681	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Certainly my austere appearance is too beguiling for the everyday household to handle.
3894682	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 Lufel. I've been meaning to say this for a while	 but...
3894683	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Could you stop using such fancy words? I know
you wanna sound refined	 but I have no idea
what you're talking about half the time.
3894684	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I-I am doing no such thing!
3894688	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As my memories started returning	 I realized
I possess knowledge of humanity dating back
ages prior to the current era...
3894689	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha. Okay	 okay. Since we're a team from
here on out	 let's be the kind of teammates
that can tell each other anything.
3894690	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Glad to be part of the team	 fellow Phantom Thieves. Let's give it our all!
3894692	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oops	 almost forgot I'm on classroom duty today!
3894693	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And I have to get changed for gym first
period! I gotta go	 catch you later!
3894685	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good grief. Seems our team of Phantom Thieves certainly won't be lacking in energy.
3894686	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Was he just talking to someone...?
3894720	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Excellent work today. Your review was as cutting as ever!
3894721	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	It went according to plan is all.
3894722	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You even had their part-timers running scared before you even finished.
3894723	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You're incredible	 Miyazawa-san. But I'd expect nothing less from a condemned Menace!
3894724	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh stop! That makes me sound like a criminal.
3894725	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Publishing my name and picture like that's no laughing matter.
3894726	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I am a critic	 above all else. A gourmet food connoisseur. I just don't hold back with my reviews is all.
3894727	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Hahah. But Menaces are at the center of public attention right now	 so it certainly isn't hurting your influence.
3894728	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hehe. Well as they say	 you gotta milk it for all it's worth.
3894729	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That Heritage Kitchen shop I tore to shreds today in Zoshigaya is the parent store to Victory Kitchen...
3894730	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So even if my critiques are all lies	 the public will slurp it up and run the place right out of business.
3894731	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That oughta force ol' Pops to hand the rights to Victory Kitchen over to me.
3894732	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Once Victory Kitchen's yours	 we can finally go ahead and establish a chain!
3894733	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	But...
3894734	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	What?
3894735	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Is this really okay? Changing the soup completely and passing it off like it's the real thing?
3894736	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Listen...
3894737	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Who on earth could possibly prove it's not?
3894738	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Uhh	 well	 ahaha...
3894739	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Here's the deal: no one actually gives a damn
about authenticity. People will glom onto
whatever's popular so they can fit in.
3894740	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Calling it the "true" soup is all part of the branding. Got it?
3894741	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	If that's too hard for you to understand	 you
should resign. There's a horde of people
tripping over themselves for your spot.
3894742	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I-I'm sorry! Please excuse me	 sir.
3894743	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Helloooo! This is Miyazawa. Thank you for calling!
3894744	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh yes	 I did see the news. Oh	 I was so surprised.
3894745	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	My my	 and just when you were about to condemn him too. What a shame.
3894746	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I know! A perfectly good Menace slipped right through our fingers. Of course	 we'll need to find a replacement.
3894747	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yes	 of course	 I'll be looking for someone to fill his place as well. Okay	 bye bye.
3894748	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	A replacement...
3894749	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Now where am I going to find someone who can rival the likes of the Subway Slammer...?
3894765	Girl A	Hey! Motoha's on our team!
3894766	Girl B	Huh? Obviously she's on ours!
3894767	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm fine with whatever...
3894768	PE Teacher	All right	 find a partner and start stretching!
3894769	Girl A	Motoha!
3894770	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ha-yah!
3894771	Girls	That was amazing	 Motoha!
3894772	Girl A	Motoha	 you're incredible!
3894774	Girl B	That spike was amazing!
3894775	Girl A	I know	 right? I can't believe it!
3894773	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey.
3894790	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sit down.
3894792	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We're supposed to be stretching. You need a partner	 don't you?
3894793	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I need to ask you somethin'.
3894794	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Um	 the girl you were with the other day... Arai? What's the deal with you two?
3894796	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hmm...
3894798	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî!? That's not it!
3894799	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She... Arai	 she could tell. She knew the taste of Victory Kitchen's soup was different.
3894800	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I used to work at that shop part-time.
3894801	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All anyone ever says is it tastes good. But
Arai came right out and said the truth.
What a badass.
3894802	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm not really good at speakin' my mind	 but she's like the total opposite.
3894803	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah! Sorry about that.
3894804	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe I really am no good to be around.
3894820	Gos<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>iping Student	Hey	 Divine Justice was just updated. Apparently Hiromu Miyazawa tore apart another restaurant with his review.
3894821	Bad-Man<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ered Male Student	Seriously? Man	 god bless the Menace. Always givin' us somethin' to talk about.
3894822	Bad-Man<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ered Male Student	He ripped apart a mom-and-pop shop saying	 "The food was foul	 and the service was heinous." Brutal!
3894823	Gos<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>iping Student	But you can't seriously think that's enough to call the guy a Menace	 do you?
3894824	Bad-Man<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ered Male Student	Huh? But the guy's taken down entire restaurants with these reviews. That's a bad dude.
3894825	Gos<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>iping Student	He's willing to show his face even if he gets dragged all over the internet for it. Just goes to show how serious he is.
3894826	Gos<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>iping Student	I think an old shop getting lazy and letting
their food and service go to hell is more of
a Menace than him.
3894827	Bad-Man<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ered Male Student	Yeah... I guess you have a point. I know! I'll put the shop up for Divine Justice too.
3894829	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey! You sure took your time.
3894830	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's a pretty goofy walk you got going on there...
3894832	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3894833	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah	 I saw you guys were paired up at gym class.
3894834	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He asked you to be partners	 right? Kinda unexpected based on the vibe he gave off yesterday.
3894835	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What'd you guys talk about?
3894837	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sense of taste...? Ohhh	 you mean about the broth at Victory Kitchen!
3894838	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's what you guys talked about? I guess
Kano-kun loves him some ramen.
3894839	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 he had a part-time job there!? That's intense.
3894840	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 really!? Oh yeah	 we did see him talk to the chef about something.
3894841	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But to work there even part-time... Kano-kun
must be really into ramen.
3894842	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyway	 now that {NAME2}'s back	 shall we get him up to speed?
3894843	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah	 we were just talking about our next job.
3894844	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So Lufel found Kiuchi's Palace on his own	
right? But we still don't know where the
other Palaces are yet...
3894845	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So I was thinking	 why don't we all work together to find the next one?
3894846	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I	 for one	 am definitely in favor of Motoha's plan. It would be much safer searching in a group than alone.
3894848	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 that's a plan! Let me know when you
want to go looking!
3894849	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But	 before we look for Palaces	 there's somewhere I want to stop by first.
3894850	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd like to share the intel we received today with Motoha. About the clinic in Yongen-Jaya.
3894851	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A clinic in Yongen?
3894852	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 the Takemi Medical Clinic	 was it? It seems we can get our hands on strong prescriptions there.
3894853	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoaaa	 for real?
3894854	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But... Do you really think they'd prescribe medicine to us despite not being injured or anything?
3894855	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Time for our next class. Uh... Are you gonna get changed or...?
3894870	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahhh... Another long day over!
3894871	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You guys are headed to the clinic in Yongen	 right?
3894872	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's the plan. What about you	 Motoha?
3894873	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm gonna visit Tomoko in the hospital. I wanna tell her what happened with Kiuchi.
3894874	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's from Tomoko!
3894875	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uhhh... Ah! Tomoko's getting discharged from the hospital!
3894876	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's wonderful news. You should go meet her.
3894877	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? But	 is that okay? What about the clinic?
3894878	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Following your desire is most important.
3894879	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I said so before	 didn't I? I don't intend
for this job to limit your freedom.
3894880	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks	 you two.
3894881	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh god	 I'm crying. It's just... finally hearing from Tomoko after she was so down...
3894883	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay!
3894884	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 before I forget. You said the Takemi Medical Clinic	 right? I just looked it up	 so I'll send you the address.
3894886	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. I think I have an idea of its whereabouts. Thank you	 Motoha.
3894887	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll get going then! Good luck with the clinic!
3894888	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 shall we head to Yongen-Jaya?
3894900	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you remember the secondhand shop we got the workbench from?
3894901	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The clinic should be just left of there.
3894910	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Takemi Medical Clinic... Here it is.
3894911	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just to make sure we're on the same page	 our goal here is to obtain medicine.
3894912	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So it'd be best for you to pose as a patient so we can get some. Don't mess it up	 all right?
3894914	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right then. Let's go.
3894930	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	First-time visitor	 yeah? What brings you in?
3894931	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	What are you here for today?
3894933	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	I see...
3894934	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	Please head to the exam room.
3894955	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	It must be stress.
3894956	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	I'll give you something to help you get some rest. Sleep is the best medicine.
3894958	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	Hmm	 so you have something specific in mind. And judging by your face	 you want a lot of it.
3894959	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	You're not sick	 are you? You're here because you heard the rumors	 right?
3894961	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	You're a weird kid	 huh?
3894962	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	Fine by me then. You came all this way just for medicine after all.
3894963	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	I'll write you a prescription. But only for medication that will recover your health.
3894964	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	Just so you're aware	 all the medicine I dispense is original.
3894965	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	I have a license to make my own formulas. But
you're responsible for your own health if you
take them. Long as you're fine with that.
3894966	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	It's your responsibility to take care of
yourself. So if that's okay with you	
stop by anytime.
3894968	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nguid Doctor	I'm sure the name of the clinic already gave
it away	 but I'm <color=#FF423F>Tae Takemi</color>.
3894969	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>e Takemi	Oh	 by the way. If you cause any problems for me	 the deal's off.
3894970	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>e Takemi	This is all I've got right now...
3894971	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>e Takemi	Take care.
3895000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right. We've secured ourselves a medicine supplier.
3895001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	How's it going?
3895003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Guess it went well then.
3895004	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm good to go whenever	 so hit me up when you wanna search Mementos!
3895020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Can we talk for a moment?
3895021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you remember the fortune teller we met last night?
3895023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. Her prediction that "trying to sate our hunger would lead to disaster..."
3895024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...actually turned out to be true.
3895028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now I find myself in want of such power. Learning to use it could be very beneficial to us.
3895026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Airsoft Shop in Shibuya	 the clinic in Yongen-Jaya	 and the Fortune Teller in Shinjuku.
3895027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's remember these places when preparing to enter the Metaverse.
3895060	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right. Our goal is to find the next Palace	 right?
3895061	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	With Kiuchi's Palace	 you were able to sense it somehow	 weren't you	 Cattle?
3895062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. Tuning into the sound of the collective unconscious allowed me to sniff it out.
3895063	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 and this collective unconscious sound... Can you still make it out from here?
3895064	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Unsurprisingly	 it's rather challenging to hear the area ahead from this spot.
3895066	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Mementos contains multiple distinct areas.
3895067	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is an entirely separate area ahead of us.
3895068	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So would that mean each area has its own Palace with its own Treasure?
3895069	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. You're pretty quick on the uptake	 Closer.
3895070	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But how're we gonna get to the next area?
3895071	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I believe it'll be easier to show you.
3895072	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Get in. We're heading into the depths of this area.
3895100	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A dead end?
3895101	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 it sorta looks like a door.
3895102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Observe.
3895103	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It opened!
3895104	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>vigation Voice	A new area has been confirmed. Updating guidance information.
3895105	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What was that voice?
3895106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Metaverse Navigator.
3895107	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 I've never seen this screen before. Check yours	 Wonder.
3895109	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's the same.
3895110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I've mentioned	 Mementos is the collective unconscious of humanity.
3895111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Those with fervent desires are considered
disruptive here	 causing the collective
unconscious force to try to expel them.
3895112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I used that force to our advantage and opened the door.
3895113	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Intense desire?
3895114	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We are in possession of Kiuchi's Treasure	 are we not?
3895115	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! So because we have the Treasure	 we're mistaken for holding intense desire...
3895116	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And then Mementos tries to force us out... Hang on.
3895117	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So the door didn't open to let us through...
3895118	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...but to mean	 "What are you doing? Get outta here!"?
3895119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is correct.
3895121	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're phantom thieves. It'd be strange if they welcomed us in with open arms.
3895122	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess you have a point there.
3895123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So from here on out	 we find the Palace in each area	 steal the Treasure	 then move on to the next one.
3895124	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We continue like that until we've reached the furthest depths of Mementos.
3895126	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yup! We'll be with you every step of the way.
3895127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 dependable as ever. Since we're here	 shall we proceed to the next area?
3895150	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So this is the new area? It feels pretty different to the last one.
3895151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmmm.
3895152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The next Palace must be in this area... but I can't narrow in on its location.
3895153	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you can't find it?
3895154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With Kiuchi	 there was a lot of public attention on his erratic behavior.
3895155	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That made it easy to gather information on his Palace quickly.
3895156	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 Kiuchi had a lot of victims... and everyone knew the Subway Slammer.
3895157	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So the next Palace ruler must be someone doing bad things in secret.
3895158	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Most bad people start out that way	 so it's certainly a plausible assumption.
3895159	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is no need for immediate haste. If we can't find any information here	 we'll just have to return to the real world.
3895160	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Opening up this new area of Mementos likely had some impact there as well.
3895161	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah. The Metaverse and the real world are supposed to be linked somehow	 right?
3895162	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. That link could aid us in locating the Palace. Let's head back to the real world for now.
3895163	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We could keep exploring	 but we're likely to come upon stronger enemies than we've ever battled before. Stay vigilant.
3895200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*yawn* I'm beat! Coming back from the Metaverse always makes me hungry.
3895201	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! How about we give our victory party a do-over? We could go back to Victory Kitchen!
3895203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well I'm sure if I order the salt or miso-flavored ramen it'll probably be fine.
3895204	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Better not. They're all the same.
3895205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Oh	 Kano-kun!
3895206	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah	 sorry. Ignore me. I just heard you guys talkin' and‚Äî
3895207	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 wait! You used to work at Victory Kitchen	 right?
3895208	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've been thinking... there's something off about the new flavor of the soup.
3895209	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3895210	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Am I just losing my mind here? Everyone else seems to think it's perfectly fine...
3895211	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No... You're right	 Arai.
3895212	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Victory Kitchen's true flavor was ruined... What they're serving now is a betrayal to their customers.
3895213	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 really?
3895214	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But don't get me wrong. It's not the staff's fault.
3895216	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Nothing...
3895217	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I think that's a good idea.
3895218	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay. I'm sure you know what you're talking about since you worked there.
3895219	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I just wanted to taste the ramen from my little league days.
3895220	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's kind of sad knowing it's gone...
3895221	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......!
3895222	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? Was that...?
3895223	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Arai. How would you like to have a real bowl of Victory Ramen?
3895224	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Well	 yeah.
3895225	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay. In that case...
3895226	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tonight I'll show you a shop where you can get some authentic Victory Ramen. If you want.
3895227	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 really!?
3895228	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I'm sure it won't disappoint.
3895229	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How about you	 {NAME1}? You've got "hungry" written all over your face.
3895231	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hah. You're a pretty funny guy.
3895232	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I said tonight	 didn't I? I'm sure you'll be hungry by then.
3895233	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm not up to anything. I just invited you to eat some ramen	 geez.
3895234	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Meet me at Heritage Kitchen tonight. You can find the address online.
3895235	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	See ya later then.
3895236	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yay! I get to taste Victory Ramen again. I can't wait!
3895237	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That Kano guy... could he be...
3895238	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm? What is it	 Lufel?
3895239	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Um	 it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
3895240	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You two enjoy the ramen without me. My presence would likely trouble the staff.
3895241	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But	 {NAME2}! Don't you forget to put some roasted pork in your bag for me.
3895242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 let's head home for now and meet back up at Heritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya tonight!
3895261	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 {NAME2}. Ready for some ramen at Heritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya!?
3895262	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm headed there now! See you in a bit!
3895263	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 we should get going as well.
3895280	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 {NAME2}	 over here!
3895281	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Seems like Kano-kun's not here yet.
3895282	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The sign says "Temporarily closed. Reopening TBD." Do you think we're in the right place?
3895283	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I tried looking it up just to be sure	 but there's no other shops with the same name.
3895284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Also	 it seems like this place has weirdly awful reviews.
3895285	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on... "Heritage Kitchen." I feel like I've heard that name before.
3895287	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah	 you're here.
3895288	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kano-kun! You were inside?
3895289	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I know the owner. Come on in.
3895331	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That was sooo good! I enjoyed that with my whole heart and soul.
3895333	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Great. Glad you liked it.
3895334	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My pleasure.
3895335	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Seeing the joy on your faces from eating my soup made the effort worth it.
3895336	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on	 you made this!? Not someone from the restaurant!?
3895337	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I mean	 I'm still in training though.
3895338	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even still	 that's amazing! Your soup tastes
exactly like the Victory Kitchen from back
then. This is the flavor I was craving.
3895339	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But wait	 this is Heritage Kitchen	 isn't it? Why does the soup taste like Victory Kitchen?
3895340	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You really have a keen sense of taste	 Arai.
3895341	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku is a branch store of Heritage Kitchen.
3895342	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ohhh	 so this store's the original!
3895343	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's right. This is a Chinese restaurant	 but its renowned ramen brought in lots of young chefs looking to train.
3895344	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So the owner	 Pops	 decided to open Victory Kitchen as a sort of training ground for aspiring chefs.
3895345	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow! The owner must be really passionate about cooking.
3895346	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I was blown away when I first tried the ramen here...
3895347	L<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>te Middle-aged Man	Now don't go on flatterin' me	 Shun.
3895348	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yamagoshi-san!?
3895349	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Welcome	 you two. Make yourselves at home.
3895350	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are you all right? You really should be resting.
3895351	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I feel fine now. It's not every day I see you bring friends here. Least lemme say hello.
3895352	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	So	 where do you two live? Do you do the uh	 emailin'? No wait	 textin'?
3895353	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 what?
3895354	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî!? Pops! What're ya talkin' about?
3895355	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Haha	 relax	 Shun. Young people these days are always exchangin' beeper numbers and all that	 right?
3895356	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No one uses those anymore	 Pops...
3895357	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Sorry	 you two. Shun's a great kid	 but he's a bit shy when it comes to socializin'.
3895358	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	If ya ever need a hand	 just gimme a beep.
3895359	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	P-Please stop...
3895360	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha	 you're so funny! Might as well exchange info.
3895362	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	So then	 what'd ya think of the flavor? Suit your taste all right?
3895363	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It was delicious! I've been really missing this taste!
3895364	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The taste of the bonito flakes just hits you like "bam!" It kinda brings out the flavor of all the other ingredients! Right?
3895366	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Haha	 I told ya so	 Shun! Great work!
3895367	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 I... But...
3895368	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I know what you're gonna say.
3895369	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	From the smell	 I'm guessin' you still can't get the shavings quite right	 is that it?
3895370	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You really are the master. Yeah	 I can't get the shavings to come out the way I want...
3895371	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	All right	 I'll take a look at your technique. After you see your friends off	 we can practice in the kitc‚Äî
3895372	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	*cough* *wheeze*
3895373	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yamagoshi-san!?
3895374	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're not well! You need rest or you'll...
3895375	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	How can I sleep after that damn Miyazawa came by...
3895376	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa was here!?
3895377	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	He scared the entire staff into quittin'. Now
I can't run the shop tomorrow. I don't know
what's gonna happen to this place...
3895378	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	All I ever wanted was to give customers authentic flavor...
3895379	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops...
3895380	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I gotta clean up and help Pops get home. Thanks for today.
3895381	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No problem! Thank you for the food! It was amazing!
3895383	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sure thing. See ya.
3895450	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do you think Yamagoshi-san's okay? I'm worried...
3895451	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And "that damn Miyazawa"? What do you think that's about?
3895452	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's being stolen.
3895453	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh hey	 Lufel. You've been so quiet and well-behaved. Good boy!
3895454	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 hang on	 "It's being stolen"? What's being stolen?
3895455	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hope. I can sense traces of exploited desire around here.
3895456	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If it's coming from here	 then that means...
3895457	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The next Palace is connected with this shop somehow?
3895458	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Oh? You two are...?
3895459	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um... Oh	 you're the chef from Victory Kitchen	 right?
3895460	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Ahhh	 you came to the shop the other day! I'm so sorry about what happened.
3895461	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	U-Uh	 no problem! We got our refund	 so there's no need to apologize any more...
3895462	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Don't be silly. We owe our shop to customers like you.
3895463	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But ever since Miyazawa got involved...!
3895464	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? This guy seems to know a lot about whatever's going on between the shop and Miyazawa.
3895465	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And it appears his hope is being stolen as well. We should listen to what he has to say.
3895466	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	By the way	 based on those uniforms I'm guessing you two go to Kokatsu	 right?
3895467	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	We have a part-timer at Victory Kitchen who goes there too. Well	 I guess he doesn't technically work there anymore...
3895468	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 we're actually Kano-kun's friends!
Would you mind telling us what happened
with him?
3895469	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Kano... You mean you're Shun's friends?
3895470	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Heritage Kitchen is my master's shop.
3895471	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I was worried after Miyazawa lambasted the place on TV this afternoon	 so I came by to check on him.
3895472	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Miyazawa... You mean the man who came to your shop the other day? Celebrity food critic Hiromu Miyazawa?
3895473	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Yes... Once that guy sets his sights on a
shop	 he churns out review after review	
panning the place down.
3895474	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Regardless of whether his critiques are valid
or fabricated	 his viewers lap up every word.
Eventually	 customers stop coming.
3895475	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Seriously!?
3895476	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	It'd be one thing if the shops Miyazawa blasted were actually bad	 but...
3895477	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	The real reason he gives such bad reviews is so he can steal the rights to a shop after putting them out of business.
3895478	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	He ruins a shop's reputation	 messes with the flavor of their dishes	 and then reopens.
3895479	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's why Victory Kitchen tastes different than before!
3895480	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	That's right. It's exactly how it seems. Our new broth is made with shoddy ingredients.
3895482	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! I bet if word got out about what he's doing	 the public would eat him alive!
3895483	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Even if I did expose him	 no one would believe it. Besides	 Miyazawa's a condemned Menace now...
3895484	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	He has contacts all over the food and showbiz
industries doing backdoor deals to prevent
any evidence or testimony getting out.
3895485	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Against Miyazawa's overwhelming influence	 the shop would be forced to shut down.
3895486	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But there must be something we can do about it!
3895487	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	We could beg Miyazawa to retract the review	 but that would mean...
3895488	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	No	 I shouldn't be bothering you two with this stuff. Sorry	 don't worry about it.
3895489	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But... Why did Miyazawa set his sights on Victory Kitchen in the first place?
3895490	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	No idea... I don't know what would make him go after us.
3895491	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But I do know that Shun is blaming himself for it.
3895493	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	The first time Miyazawa came to review our shop	 Shun was working there...
3895494	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	The second Miyazawa started making fun of our signature broth	 Shun got angry and splashed water in his face.
3895495	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really?
3895496	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I don't know if that was the reason	 but after that Miyazawa gave us terrible reviews	 and the shop's been suffering ever since.
3895497	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But please don't misunderstand. I don't think Shun did anything wrong.
3895498	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Miyazawa insulted our pride as professional chefs. We should have been the ones to stand up to him.
3895499	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Poor Shun saw us unable to act	 and stood up to him in our place.
3711022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think Kano-kun is still inside. You should
go talk to him.
3711019	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	No... I should go.
3711020	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Shun's been hard on himself ever since what happened. He thinks he caused trouble for everyone at the shop.
3711021	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	If I talk to him now	 he might end up feeling more guilty	 and I don't want to put him through that.
3700303	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Masa-san...
3700304	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Anyway	 sorry to bug you with all this. I hope you two will keep being good friends with Shun.
3701124	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just as I thought. People who have some form of connection to this shop are having their hope stolen.
3701128	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yamagoshi-san	 Masa-san	 and Kano-kun	 too...
3700354	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's right. And it's likely someone related to the shop is the next Palace's ruler.
3700360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's come back tomorrow and investigate the area around the shop. I'd like to confirm my suspicions.
3895500	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Good morning	 {NAME1}-kun.
3895502	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks for talking to me like normal. I've been anxious about coming back to school...
3895503	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah	 I'm able to go to school again starting today.
3895504	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm worried everyone at school's probably been talking about me.
3895505	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Getting attacked by the notorious Subway Slammer	 Kiuchi... Falling onto the subway tracks and ending up in the hospital...
3895507	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right... Thanks.
3895508	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	After the incident	 everything fell apart.
The dream Motoha and I shared was shattered	
I put the baseball team through a lot...
3895509	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Baseball's the only thing I was good for	 and now that's gone too.
3895510	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I didn't really know what to do with myself... For a while I really lost the will to go on...
3895511	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But Motoha... She was there for me through all of it. Comforting me	 encouraging me...
3895512	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She told me about you too. She said you came to see me at the hospital. Thanks for that.
3895513	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then when she broke the news about Kiuchi getting caught	 all of a sudden I thought...
3895514	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I want to live. It was like this energy surging up in my heart.
3895515	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe hearing the news about Kiuchi was exactly what I needed. Guess I'm easy to please	 haha.
3895516	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm sure the change of heart was a factor	 but this is likely due to us unsealing a new area of Mementos.
3895517	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The people who couldn't reckon with their desires are slowly starting to grab hold of hope once again.
3895519	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You think so? Hehe	 that's nice of you to say. Truth is	 I was kind of scared to come to the station today.
3895520	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But seeing you here helps. I'm glad I get to go to school again.
3895521	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It really is. And I'm glad that Motoha seems a lot happier recently too.
3895522	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I wonder if something's been making her happy these days... Or maybe someone...?
3895523	Station Announcement	The train will be arriving shortly. Please wait behind the yellow line.
3895524	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 sorry! Didn't mean to talk your ear off. The train's coming	 so let's talk later	 okay?
3895530	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Today was sooo long. The scholar's life is definitely not for me!
3895531	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So what's the plan today? Should we hit Mementos?
3895532	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The next Palace ruler likely has some connection to Heritage Kitchen. Let's give the place another visit.
3711023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	They're closed again today. I hope Yamagoshi-san's doing okay.
3711024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It smells...
3711025	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? No way	 do I really!?
3711026	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I-I did get kind of sweaty from gym today... Ahahah...
3711027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not your smell. I can sense waning desire from within the shop.
3711028	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Inside? So then...!
3711029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's check it out. But the same cautions from confronting Kiuchi apply here	 so stay on your guard.
3711104	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I told you	 it's simple. All you have to do is stamp your name on this little piece of paper. What's the hold up?
3711105	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	......
3711106	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	No. I can't do it. I won't turn this shop	 or Victory Kitchen	 over to you.
3711107	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You just keep harping on the same old tune	 don't you? Enough dancing	 Yamagoshi-san. Time to sing a new song.
3711108	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I'm sorry	 we're closed today... Oh	 it's you two...
3711109	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Whaddya want? We're in the middle of serious business right now.
3711287	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hiromu Miyazawa!? Why are you here?
3711288	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Manager	 escort these kids to the door.
3711289	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	How dare you! These are my valued customers. You're the ones who should leave.
3711290	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Excuse me? Is that really how you want to play this? Your shop's on the brink of collapse	 y'know.
3711291	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yamagoshi-san	 your health isn't what it used to be. I'm already in talks with Masa-kun from Victory Kitchen...
3711292	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	All you have to do is sign the contract passing ownership over to me.
3711293	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	In my hands	 your beloved little shop will become a booming sensation with chains across the country!
3711294	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Enough! You wanna feed my customers with your lies!?
3711295	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I won't have it! I‚Äî Ugn...!
3711296	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Whoa	 easy there. Someone in your condition shouldn't be getting themselves so worked up.
3711297	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You owned this shop with your late wife	 didn't you? Do you really want to watch it all crumble?
3711298	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You'd let your only memory of her slip through your fingers over something as trifling as "authentic flavor"?
3711299	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You don't know the first thing about‚Äî
3711214	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Nngh...
3711215	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yamagoshi-san!
3711216	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh dear	 he really has overdone it. You there	 girl	 call an ambulance	 would ya?
3711217	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Like I need you to tell me!
3711218	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Okay	 contract signed.
3711220	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You need your eyes checked	 kid. You didn't see Yamagoshi-san stamp the contract just now?
3711221	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops!
3711222	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa!
3711223	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You bastard! What did you do to him!?
3711224	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Uch... I didn't do... anything. Ach... Let go! What	 are you gonna hit me...?
3711225	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Shun... Stop...
3711226	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops!
3711227	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Manager	 you got that	 right!?
3711228	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Violent Punk Attacks Celebrity Critic... If I post this video	 you are finished. Your future? Gone.
3711229	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So I'd recommend keeping quiet	 Yamagoshi-san. For your sake and his.
3711234	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You monster!
3711235	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Shun... He's trying to bait you... Don't give him what he wants...
3711236	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I-I'm sorry	 Pops... I lost it again...
3711237	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Just like last time... I'm making things even worse...!
3711238	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You haven't done anything wrong	 Shun. In fact	 I like that side of you.
3711239	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Blunt	 straightforward	 a little rough around the edges... with a dead-set determination for cooking.
3711240	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......!
3711241	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Never forget	 Shun. A smiling customer is what brings us chefs pride.
3711242	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Please	 never turn your back on tha‚Äî *hack*
3711243	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops!
3711244	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh brother	 enough with the tears and the melodrama. You're making me out like the bad guy.
3711246	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh dear	 are all youths these days so insolent? And they say I'm a Menace?
3711247	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ah...! Here's an idea.
3711248	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You. Shun-kun	 was it? How would you like me to give you a fighting chance?
3711249	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh?
3711500	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Let's decide this with a Food Fight!
3711501	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Food fight...?
3711502	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yes	 Food Fight! It's a video series on my channel. You haven't heard of it?
3711503	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The contestant cooks a dish	 and if it wows my tastebuds I declare them the winner!
3711504	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	If by some chance you manage to win	 I'll stop going after your precious little shops.
3711505	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî!?
3711506	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Buuut	 if you're really that insecure	 you don't have to compete. I'm more than happy taking the shop here and now.
3711507	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So what's it gonna be?
3711509	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hey	 hey	 don't fold so easily. I've lost matches before.
3700361	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That means even you have a chance of winning. So	 Shun-kun. How about it? Are you in?
3700362	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll do it.
3711518	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You want a fight? You got one!
3711519	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That's the spirit! All right then	 I'll announce the date on my channel.
3711520	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So keep an eye out for the details. Try not to go running scared before then	 kid.
3711521	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kano-kun! The ambulance is here!
3711522	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Sounds like our cue to split. See you again	 Shun-kun.
3700363	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Miyazawa. You already stamped the contract. Why bother challenging the kid to a Food Fight?
3711524	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Cause that brat's gotten on my last nerve. Screaming "real" this	 "authentic" that...
3711525	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	This way we can break him down and shut him up for good.
3711526	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And if we get him roasted online in the process	 I can finally get my hands on the replacement I've been looking for.
3711527	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Replacement for what?
3711528	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You don't need to know. Now then	 I have an announcement video to make!
3711529	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	One of the neighbors went with him in the ambulance.
3711530	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay. It seems like his breathing is mostly back to normal. I'm sure he'll be okay...
3711531	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And um	 Kano-kun? {NAME2} sort of
mentioned... You're taking part in a
Food Fight?
3711532	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3711533	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've actually seen the show before. Miyazawa
competes with chefs who've disputed
his reviews.
3711534	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In the end they lose	 get savage reviews	
and it's made to look like Miyazawa was
right all along.
3711535	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And it's not like it's live TV. It's his own
channel	 so he can have the footage edited
however he wants. It's got to be a trap!
3711536	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... You're probably right. But I don't
have any other option.
3711537	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Apparently Miyazawa's lost before. So if it
means even the slightest chance of winning
the shop back	 I have to take the risk.
3711538	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Miyazawa losing at his own game? I don't
know	 there's definitely something fishy
about that...
3711540	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right...
3711541	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	How about we just go public with this? Let
everyone know that Miyazawa sabotaged Victory
Kitchen's flavor with cheap ingredients.
3711542	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You know how much influence he has. The second we say somethin'	 he'll just spin some more lies and fool everyone.
3711543	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No one will believe the truth unless they hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
3711544	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 let's say you manage to win the Food Fight. How do we know Miyazawa won't just...
3711545	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 I doubt he'll follow through on his promise to leave the shop alone...
3711546	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But even if I lose	 I'd just be some stupid
kid who made a fool of himself. I won't cause
any trouble for Pops or the staff.
3711547	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Long as I'm the only one that stands to get hurt	 I don't mind fighting a losing battle.
3711548	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kano-kun...
3711549	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Don't worry about me. If you guys get involved any further	 Miyazawa might come after you too.
3711550	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll figure somethin' out on my own. Please... Don't get tangled up in my mess anymore.
3711551	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no doubt about it. The next Palace's ruler has to be Hiromu Miyazawa.
3711552	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He's the only one using the situation at Heritage Kitchen to fulfill his own selfish desires.
3711553	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The people caught in his crosshairs and even
the customers	 are all having their
desires stolen.
3711554	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right. Everyone's getting dragged
along by Miyazawa's opinion	 so despite the
obvious drop in quality...
3711555	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...they think nothing of it. And all the
staff can do is throw in the towel and suffer
in silence.
3711556	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. And you remember what happens to a person once all of their hope's been stolen from them	 right	 {NAME2}?
3711558	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. We have to take back their desires and make Miyazawa confess to his crimes.
3711559	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right then	 let's head to Mementos. I'm sure we'll be able to find Miyazawa's Palace now.
3711590	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remember	 we're entering a new area	 which
means stronger enemies. Let's ensure we have
everything we need before proceeding.
3895550	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We going in? Okay...
3895551	Hung<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>y Office Worker	You wanna hit Zoshigaya tonight? I'm craving some Heritage Kitchen gyoza.
3895552	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>odie Office Worker	Huh? That place has been getting awful reviews lately. Look	 one-stars across the board.
3895553	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>odie Office Worker	Trying to ride the success of days long passed, Heritage Kitchen's given up on improving itself all together.
3895554	H<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ngry Office Worker	Aw	 damn! That place used to be so good. A great bang for your buck too!
3895555	H<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ngry Office Worker	There goes another of my few remaining joys in life...
3895556	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>odie Office Worker	Well	 nothin' to do but give up and get over it.
3895557	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's true... All the people who saw Miyazawa's show are leaving horrible reviews about Heritage Kitchen.
3895558	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even people who've never been to the shop before are posting complaints about it.
3895559	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another side effect of living in a world of fading hope.
3895560	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Losing desire can lead one to lose their own
agency	 leaving them suggestible and easily
herded along by public opinion.
3895561	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So before things get that far...
3895562	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We have to find Miyazawa's Palace and take it down.
3895590	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hellooo	 glad you picked up. Yes	 uh-huh	 of course. I'll get right to the point...
3895591	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I found the peeerfect replacement for Kiuchi.
3895592	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	He's a hot-headed youth... Yes	 and I've set him up so he'll have no choice but to appear on my program...
3895593	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And	 um... If everything goes to plan this time... Well	 about the entertainment production committee...
3895594	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yes	 of course. Only if the plan goes well	 right... I would be so thankful for your consideration...!
3895595	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yes	 of course... Thank you for your time! All right	 thank you	 bye bye now.
3895596	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	*chuckle* Finally... Finally my dream is becoming a reality...
3895597	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Sorry	 Shun-kun. Can't make a best picture without a few cuts.
3895640	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hiromu... Miyazawa...
3895641	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right.
3895642	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems the Palace ruler is definitely Miyazawa.
3895643	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From the voices of humanity responding to his name	 I can sense the Palace just ahead.
3895644	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nice! So	 you know where it is?
3895645	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. It shouldn't be far from here. Let's go.
3895660	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're here. Right beyond this point is... Hiromu Miyazawa's Palace.
3895661	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The entrance looks just like the one to Kiuchi's Palace.
3895662	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Palace rulers revel in their own twisted desires	 so they're considered deviant by the public.
3895663	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Even within Mementos	 Palaces take the form of solitary fortresses	 separated from the rest of society.
3895664	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So Kiuchi and Miyazawa were shunned by the collective unconscious the same way we were kicked into this new area?
3895665	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The wandering Shadows inside are likely under Miyazawa's control	 so don't let your guards down.
3895670	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like we can't get past here!
3895671	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's see if we can find an infiltration
route nearby. Perhaps we can get in
without alerting any enemies...
3895672	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right! Let's get moving then!
3895685	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A Japanese castle...? And a super flashy-looking one at that...
3895686	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is supposedly Miyazawa's perception of reality...
3895687	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But why a castle? Do you think the inside's actually a huge ramen shop or something?
3895681	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haha	 glad someone's got a sense of humor.
3895682	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Delicious...?
3895683	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well I'm sure we'll uncover a great deal of the Palace's mysteries as we search for the Treasure.
3895684	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The plan up until the change of heart is the same as it was for Kiuchi.
3895689	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right. First locate a route to the Treasure	 then send out the calling card... right?
3895647	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's right. Now	 stay sharp you two. Let's get moving!
3895700	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This area is completely different from what we've seen here so far.
3895701	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That sign says	 "Open Set."
3895702	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 look at that.
3895703	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Those are cameras and film equipment... right?
3895705	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah	 it's a film studio! This isn't a real castle	 it's a set made to look like a castle.
3895706	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But why a film studio? Does it have something to do with Miyazawa's desires?
3895707	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're still some distance away from the Treasure.
3895708	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like we can head further through there.
3895740	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not budging	 huh?
3895741	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What is that? There's some sort of movie poster hung on the wall here...
3895742	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come look at this!
3895743	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's... Kano-kun	 isn't it? He's even
wearing our school uniform.
3895744	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's something written up there	 yes?
Let me see.
3895745	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Coming Soon... Brat vs. Blade: The
Final Cut.
3895746	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Brat vs. Blade: The Final Cut? By the look
of things	 Miyazawa's probably got something
nasty planned for Kano-kun...
3895747	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So that means...!
3895749	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right! It has to be.
3895750	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He has no intention to give Kano-kun a
chance to win in the slightest!
3895751	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. I think this must be about the
Food Fight!
3895752	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So Miyazawa planned to destroy Kano-kun in
the fight from the get-go!
3895753	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right. And the "Coming Soon" bit must be
referring to the day of the Food Fight.
3895754	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In other words	 we can't get into this area
until the fight happens.
3895755	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But by then it'll already be too late!
Kano-kun's going to get hurt before we can
cause the change of heart!
3895756	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I know...
3895757	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For now all we can do is return to the real
world and try to get ahold of Shun Kano.
3895758	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. We have to stop him from doing that
Food Fight and falling into Miyazawa's trap.
3895759	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And if Kano-kun refuses to fight	 this
barrier will probably change too.
3895760	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's talk to Kano-kun at school tomorrow	
Wonder.
3895761	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Between the film studio and movie poster	
I wonder what kind of desire twisted
Miyazawa's heart like this.
3895762	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By the way	 Closer	 do you think you
wouldn't mind putting me down anytime soon?
3895763	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Sorry!
3895764	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've made good progress strategizing.
Let's pause here for now.
3895765	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Leader	 it's up to you whether we head back
or keep exploring.
3895790	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's late. We should get
some rest.
3895791	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3895792	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let me ask you something	 {NAME2}.
3895793	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	About opening the door to that new area
in Mementos...
3895794	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It means that more people will become
awakened to their desires now.
3895795	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Kiuchi and other humans who've become Palace
rulers	 are compelled by intense desires to
walk the path to their own destruction.
3895796	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Conversely	 we	 compelled by our intense
desires	 force them to have a change
of heart.
3895797	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Despite that obvious hypocrisy	 do you still
think we're doing the right thing?
3895799	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... I wonder if that conviction is
another symptom of your strong desire.
3895800	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... Knowing you can approach things
objectively like that does make me
feel better.
3895801	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Prejudgments and one-sided beliefs will only
end up warping into evil desires.
3895802	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh... I never would've thought of it like
that. So the results determine whether an
action was right or wrong	 huh?
3895803	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sorry for the sudden question. Think of it
as a routine work check-in.
3895804	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyhoo	 it's interesting to hear the way
you think.
3895805	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Humans truly are compelling creatures.
I look forward to learning more while I'm
by your side.
3895808	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now there's the issue of our enemies in the
Metaverse growing stronger. If only we could
attain a power boost like that...
3895809	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I just wanted to taste the ramen from my
little league days.
3895810	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's kind of sad knowing it's gone...
3895811	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......!
3895812	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That time	 I thought I could sense potential
for hope coming from...
3895813	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Actually	 never mind. It's about time for bed.
3895850	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Allow me to extend my congratulations to
you on my master's behalf.
3895851	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	In addition to punishing the sinner of lust	
you have successfully identified the
next offender.
3895852	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	For this	 your unyielding desire must be
commended.
3895853	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	And I bring favorable news.
3895854	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Your actions have opened new paths of escape
from inevitable ruin.
3895856	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Offering an explanation would be simple
enough...
3895857	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	But I would hate to sully your ability to
choose for yourself.
3895865	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You ought to see it with your own eyes.
3895858	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	It would also appear that the number of
people relying on your decisions...
3895859	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	...is due to increase.
3895861	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	I believe it is suffice to say	 your choices
have already begun influencing the hopes and
desires of others...
3895862	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	You would do best to keep that in mind.
3895863	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That is all for this evening.
3895864	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	We look forward to seeing you again.
*chuckle*
3895890	Student's Voice	Lunchtime! I'm starving!
3895891	Student's Voice	What!? There's no chopsticks in my lunch
bag! That's just cruel! Is Mom a Menace
now too?
3895892	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I just checked with Tomoko. She said
Kano-kun's here today.
3895893	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What should we do? I think it should be
easy to find him during lunch.
3895895	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agreed.
3895896	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's do it.
3895897	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We have no idea when the Food Fight is
supposed to be. Don't you think contacting
Kano right away is paramount?
3895898	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's right. Let's go talk to him now.
3895899	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? I just got this text from Tomoko. She
said Kano-kun's not in the classroom.
3895900	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Maybe he's eating lunch somewhere else.
Any idea where he might be?
3895902	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 really? Okay	 let's go check there.
3895903	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You've seen him eating ramen on the rooftop
before? We should go check there then.
3895904	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Sorry to interrupt your lunch break. Could I
speak with you for a moment?
3895905	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ms. Katayama? Uh	 but we were just
about to...
3895906	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Either one of you is fine.
3895907	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In that case... I will. Do you mind	
{NAME2}?
3895908	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Ah	 much appreciated. It shouldn't take
too long.
3895909	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Good luck with Kano-kun.
3895910	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right then	 let's go look for Kano.
3895940	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What are you doin' here? You eat lunch
up here too?
3895941	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Used to be no one came up here but me...
Well	 it's all yours.
3895943	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What? You gonna tell me not to do the
Food Fight?
3895944	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We already talked about this. I know
Miyazawa has some trick up his sleeve.
3895945	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You don't have to tell me	 I already know.
3895946	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... Nothing good comes from hangin'
around me.
3895947	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So why are you here? Is it about the
Food Fight? 'Cause we already talked about
this. I know it's a setup.
3895948	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa obviously didn't suggest it out of
the goodness of his heart.
3895949	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He's gonna use the Food Fight to beat me
down so I can't speak out against him
anymore.
3895950	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But if I run away from this... it means I'd
be responsible for ruining Pops's ramen.
3895951	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's the one mistake I can't bear to
live with.
3895953	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	When I was in elementary school	 my parents
got divorced. My mother	 she raised me all
by herself.
3895954	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But my mom's an ER nurse	 so there were days
when she wouldn't get home till long past
dinner time.
3895955	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	One night	 I was so hungry	 I went into town
to try and find somethin' to eat.
3895957	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I happened to pass in front of Victory
Kitchen	 and the smell of the food comin'
from inside lured me in.
3895958	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I just stopped and stared at the shop	 with
my stomach rumbling... Then Pops	 Yamagoshi-san	
gave me a bowl on the house.
3895959	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Hey there	 sport. What's up? Ya hungry?
3895960	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3895961	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Your mom's working in the ER? Your dad is...
not around	 huh? I see...
3895962	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	What do ya think	 hit the spot?
3895963	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah!
3895964	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Aha	 we finally get to see a smile on
that face!
3895965	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You know	 this is the ramen my late wife loved the most.
3895966	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Somehow the customers too... They always
break out in a huge smile whenever they
eat it.
3895967	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Haha	 just like you right now.
3895968	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	That's why I've got to protect this flavor
for the rest of my life. It's my purpose...
My pride.
3895969	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Since then	 I started going to Victory
Kitchen regularly. I even learned to make
ramen on the down low.
3895970	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops would always say	 "Wait until
high school!"
3895972	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... Pops has always been kind of like...
a father to me.
3895973	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And Masa-san... He's my senior at
Victory Kitchen.
3895974	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The two of us always dreamed of opening our
own branch	 to make ramen with a flavor we
can call our own.
3895975	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But then Miyazawa showed up... and
everything changed.
3895976	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He came in claimin' to be some famous
gourmet so-and-so	 and started spouting BS
criticism against our soup.
3895977	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The broth tastes like something out of my
grandma's kitchen, "The bonito flakes are
second-rate..."
3895978	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All kinds of fabricated nonsense. I know what
goes in our soup	 so I was aware he was just
tryin' to drag our name through the mud.
3895979	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then... I got mad and threw a cup of water
on his face.
3895981	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's not something I'm proud of. At least
they left it out of the TV broadcast.
3895982	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 I know. I was one step from getting
the cops called on me. Good thing they left
it out of the TV broadcast.
3895983	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks to my slipup	 Victory Kitchen's become
Miyazawa's punching bag. With all his bad
reviews circulating...
3895984	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	...the shop's been facing slander from all
over. Pops has never been in good health	 but
all of this... pushed him over the edge.
3895985	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Since he's been unable to work	 the shop's
been struggling financially and the customers
have stopped comin'.
3895986	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So Masa-san begged Miyazawa. He told him that no matter what	 he can't let the shop go under.
3895987	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then Miyazawa started dictating our flavor.
He filled the soup we poured our hearts into
with cheap	 crappy bonito flakes.
3895988	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You must get it by now. This is all
my fault.
3895990	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I appreciate you sayin' that	 but firing me
was actually one of Miyazawa's conditions
for agreeing to stop the bad reviews.
3895991	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It took a lot of effort by your teacher	
Ms. Katayama	 to keep me from gettin' into
worse trouble.
3895993	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ms. Katayama had to pull a bunch of strings
to stop the water splashing incident from
being publicized.
3895994	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyway	 long story short	 I'm not gonna back
outta the Food Fight.
3895996	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 did you see that news? About the
ex-baseball player Kiuchi gettin' arrested.
3895998	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He said somethin' like	 "the evil in his
heart was lifted away	 and that's why
he confessed.
3895999,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I wish Miyazawa would just admit his
wrongdoing to the world like Kiuchi did...
3896000,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But there's no way everything could work
itself out that easily.
3896001,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sorry, one sec.
3896002,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That asshole! Are you kiddin' me!?
3896003,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I have to go. Something's come up.
3896005,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's nothin'. You should eat your lunch.
Break's almost over.
3896030,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,{NAME2}, look at this! This video was
just uploaded...
3896031,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Sorry for calling you here so suddenly,
but I think you'd better give it a watch.
3896050,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to
Katana Tongue Live.
3896051,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,Now, sorry to surprise you all during lunch
hour, but I am here to announce the next
Food Fight!
3896052,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,The battle will commence here at Shinjuku's
Victory Kitchen! You might remember it from
my Stupidly Honest Review series on TV.
3896053,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,This shop lost its flavor until I worked
with them to bring it back.
3896055,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,In light of that success, the shop's founder
Yamagoshi-san has turned management rights
over to me.
3896056,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,With this, I intend to bring Victory
Kitchen's popularity to new and greater heights!
3896057,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,But in spite of all this, there is a kid out
there claiming Victory Kitchen's current
taste is not true to the original.
3896058,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,Apparently, he's notorious for bad-mouthing
restaurants all over town.
3896059,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,What's this really about? Engagement
farming? Trying to become a Menace and get his
fifteen minutes of fame?
3896060,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,I think it's only proper to settle things
with a boy like this in front of an audience.
3896061,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,In the next episode of Food Fight, I'll have
him produce this supposed real flavor"
right here for all of you to see.
3896062	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	That is why I have borrowed the kitchen here
at Victory Kitchen for our battle today!
3896063	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So	 see you here this afternoon	 kid.
I'll be waiting!
3896064	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The Food Fight video will be uploaded within
the next few days	 so I hope you're all
looking forward to it! And remember...
3896065	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	With the might of my pen	 I cut through bad
taste cleaner than any sword!
3896066	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	This is Katana Tongue Miyazawa signing off.
Have a great lunch!
3896090	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ms. Katayama pulled me aside earlier to
show me this.
3896091	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She said the boy pictured in the video
looked like Kano-kun	 and wanted to ask if
I knew anything.
3896092	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Apparently she saw us talking with Kano-kun
outside Victory Kitchen.
3896093	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. So that's why she decided to ask one
of you.
3896094	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	According to this video	 the Food Fight's
gonna be this afternoon... So really any
minute now.
3896095	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right. I'm willing to bet that's why Kano
ran off in such a hurry before.
3896096	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He did!? So you talked to him? How did
it go!?
3896098	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa... So Victory Kitchen really is special
to Kano-kun.
3896099	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Miyazawa took it away from him	 and now he's
trying to tear it apart... I understand why
he's so angry.
3896100	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But in the end... we couldn't stop him from
going to the Food Fight...
3896101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It was beyond our control. He chose that
path by his own will.
3896102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But based on what we saw at the Palace	
Miyazawa's intent to crush Kano is real.
3896103	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've got a bad feeling about this. Obviously
I'm worried about Kano-kun losing...
3896104	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But it feels like something much worse
than that...
3896106	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You lost fair and square	 kid. Your ramen
was revolting!
3896107	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Fair and square!?
3896108	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You bastard! You threw out the soul of
Victory Kitchen	 and now‚Äî!
3896109	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh hellooo! Oh	 it went perfectly? Yes	 that
is just fantastic! Thank yooouuu!
3896110	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Congratulations	 Shun Kano-kun! You're now
officially a condemned Menace!
3896111	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Now the world knows you're a clout-chasing
punk who doesn't know the first thing about
good flavor! Wahahahahaha!
3896112	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	M-Menace...? Me?
3896113	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Shun! The hospital just called!
3700742	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Pops had a heart attack... They said
he's dead...
3896114	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My god... No...
3896115	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ahhh	 all that stress finally got to him	
huh? Thanks to a certain brat always causing
him trouble...
3896116	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Poor Yamagoshi-san... Caring about a problem
child like you literally stopped his heart.
Heheh... Gahahaha!
3896118	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? What's wrong? Are you okay?
3896120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait... Did you just have some kind
of vision?
3896121	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3896122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is pure speculation	 but it seems
{NAME2} has been having strange fits
like this ever since I met him.
3896123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're running out of time. If you have some
premonition that could help us find a
solution to this	 speak up.
3896126	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Your phone? Are you gonna call somebody?
3896127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yamagoshi?
3896128	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Yamagoshi-san must know some way we can
convince Kano-kun to back out of the fight!
3896129	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Ah	 hey there	 sport.
3896130	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Right... The Food Fight video. I saw it too.
I'm really worried about Shun...
3896131	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	But now that I'm stuck in the hospital	
I have no way to help him...
3896132	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	And... with everythin' that's happening...
I just feel so exhausted.
3896133	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	That contract to give away the shop... I don't
even remember signing it... But he has it now	
so I guess there's nothin' I can do...
3896134	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He sounds just like Tomoko did when she was
in the hospital...!
3896135	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I feel terrible for Masa and Shun... There's
just nothin' else I can do about it...
3896137	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	*gasp*
3896138	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	He's going through with the fight!? Well	
guess he's not one to back down after
gettin' called out like that.
3896139	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	But there's no way he'll get a fair shot...
Damn it! I wanna help him	 I just...
3896141	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	The soul of Victory Kitchen...?
3896142	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I think I know... But Miyazawa threw them
all away...
3896143	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Wait	 unless... there's still that...
3896144	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That...?
3896145	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Yes. I wanted to pass it down to Shun	 so I
put it in the safe at Victory Kitchen.
3896146	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	It was given to me by my late wife... I kept
it to remember her by. I planned to give it
to Shun once he completed his training.
3896147	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	If you ask Masa	 he can get it for ya. Could
you two give it to Shun for me?
3896149	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Thank you. I'm glad Shun has found such
good friends...
3711591	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I didn't catch all of that	 but essentially
there's an item in the safe at Victory
Kitchen we can use to help Kano?
3711592	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We should get over there right away!
3896150	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So that's the long and short of how this is
gonna go. Put simply...
3896151	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Shun-kun makes ramen	 we eat it	 and
criticize it.
3896152	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	This is not the authentic taste of Victory
Kitchen. Or	 "This slop cannot be called
Victory Ramen!"
3896153	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Which line do you want	 Masa-kun? Hmmm	 I
think the more fiery reaction is better	
don't you?
3896154	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	You mean the fight is fixed!? I refuse to
take part in this!
3896155	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Huh? You still think you're in a position
to refuse?
3896156	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You heard what I said in the video	 didn't
you? I am the legal owner of this shop.
3896157	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And I won't hesitate to fire your ass and
replace it with someone more compliant.
3896158	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Ngh...
3896159	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Shun's in school right now anyway! He can't
leave in the middle of the day to come here!
3896160	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So what? I'm too busy to wait. Don't you
worry	 that kid will come.
3896161	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa!
3896162	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And there he is.
3896163	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You dare call me a liar? You're the one
whose lies and bullshit ruined
Victory Kitchen!
3896164	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Wh-Wha‚Äî Shun!
3896165	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	What are you doing here!? Miyazawa is
setting you up to lose!
3896166	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I know	 Masa-san! I'm going to fight anyway.
3896167	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll defend Pops's pride... and give
Miyazawa a taste of the real Victory
Kitchen!
3896168	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Shun...
3896169	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hah! "Real" this	 "pride" that. Geez	 you and
Yamagoshi-san with your doe-eyed delusions
about "the soul of Victory Kitchen."
3896170	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Enough. Masa-kun	 you're in the way	 so
would you mind getting out?
3896171	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Huh?
3896172	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Can't have you going soft and complimenting
his food during the fight. Go on	 get out.
3896173	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Ngh...! I'm sorry	 Shun. It seems like
there's no way I can help you.
3896174	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's okay. Thanks for letting me borrow
your kitchen	 Masa-san.
3896175	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	It's not "borrowing."
3896176	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	This place is where you belong.
3896177	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	*gasp*
3896178	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Knock 'em dead	 Shun!
3896179	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay!
3896230	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Crap	 Miyazawa just posted an update...
Today's Food Fight challenger has arrived!
3896231	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kano-kun must already be at Victory Kitchen
getting ready as we speak!
3896232	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do we do? What if we don't make it
there before the fight?
3896233	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Is that an owl...?
3896234	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Sitting in his bag like that... It looks
like something out of a manga...
3896256	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	*gasp* I can use this for material!
3896257	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Notebook	 notebook... Huh? Where is it?
Just when I need it most!
3896235	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We've stopped?
3896236	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nicking Man	Huh	 what happened? Why did we stop?
3896237	Su<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>picious Woman	Could there be an accident or something?
3896238	Train Announcement	This is an announcement. A person has been
seen on the tracks. We are making an
emergency stop.
3896239	Train Announcement	We will resume travel after ensuring it
is safe.
3896240	Panic<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ing Man	You kidding me? I'm gonna miss my meeting.
3896241	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Woman	A person on the tracks... What Menace is at
work this time?
3896242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah! What do we do!? With the train stopped
we'll never make it in time!
3896243	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We have no choice. Time to make a
risky move.
3896245	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nobody's watching. Or rather	 the other
passengers are too distracted to notice us.
3896246	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Either way	 now's our chance. Activate your
Metaverse Navigator. But just be
careful that‚Äî
3896247	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Metaverse Navigator? Got it!
3896248	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 wait‚Äî!
3896249	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Yes! I found it!
3896250	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Huh?
3896251	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Did they just disappear...?
3896252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We made it to Mementos! What's next	
Cattle!?
3896253	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh god	 there's Shadows everywhere!
3896254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I said it was a risky move! I wasn't
finished explaining...
3896255	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll have to take these Shadows out first!
3896280	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew	 we did it... Okay	 explain. What did
you mean by risky?
3896281	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's risky activating the Metaverse
Navigator somewhere other than the
station entrance.
3896282	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 right. We did activate it from inside
the train this time.
3896283	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a reason we always enter the
Metaverse from Shibuya Station.
3896284	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By doing so	 we can ensure we access
Mementos from the entrance.
3896285	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we activate the Metaverse Navigator from
anywhere else	 there's no way to know where
in Mementos we might end up.
3896286	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Which means we could end up smack bang in
the middle of a swarm of Shadows like we were
just now... right?
3896287	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. Therefore it's the kind of risky
move I prefer to avoid where possible.
3896288	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	When Wonder entered the Metaverse for the
first time	 we were lucky to end up in
a good spot.
3896289	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I must say	 of all the places to make an
entrance	 this isn't half bad.
3896291	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 no matter. Of course the process is
important	 but this job is about results.
3896292	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fortunately the entrance to Shibuya Station
is nearby. Let's exit Mementos from here.
3896293	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh right	 that way we can get to the station
on foot.
3896294	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's right. Then we can board the train
for Shinjuku. Let's hurry.
3896330	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! We made it to Shibuya just like
Lufel said!
3896331	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll check the route to Shinjuku from here.
The emergency stop probably affected other
trains too.
3896332	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now may also be a good time to prepare
ourselves in advance of any trouble we
might face.
3896333	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll leave that to you	 {NAME2}.
3896360	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 are you ready to go?
3896362	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cool. Looks like the trains for Shinjuku are
running normally!
3896363	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's hurry!
3896364	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Gotcha. We should make sure we're prepared.
Just try your best to hurry!
3896400	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Okay	 Shun-kun. Let me explain to you how
Food Fight works.
3896401	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The chef cooks the recipe within the time
limit	 then I taste it.
3896402	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	If I say	 "Thank you	 it means you win.
Simple, right?
3896403,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Thank you"... Okay.
3896404	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The recipe you'll make is Victory Kitchen's
signature shoyu ramen. Are you ready?
3896405	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Now then... Lights	 camera... Food Fight!
3896406	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	First	 the most important part... the soup.
To capture Victory Kitchen's signature taste	
I have to shave the bonito flakes...
3896407	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Looking for something?
3896408	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What happened to the shaver boxes?
3896409	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Shaver boxes? Ohhh	 you mean those stinky
old cheese grater things?
3896410	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	They're out with the garbage. No need for
them here anymore.
3896411	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî!?
3896412	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Okaaay	 let's cut here.
3896413	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ngh!
3896414	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	What's with the long face	 Shun-kun? Oh	 you
know what? There is one shaver box I left
out for display.
3896415	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	It's completely rusted	 so I doubt it's
usable. But if you wanted to try... now that'd
make for some pretty good footage.
3896416	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You bastard!
3896417	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You left it out to rust!? Pops and Masa-san
treasured that thing with their lives!
3896418	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Their lives? Don't be dramatic. You gonna
let pride get in the way of doing your job?
3896419	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Well? What's it gonna be? You gonna make me
some authentic broth or not?
3896420	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You're welcome to use some of my bargain
bonito flakes! Ahahahahaha!
3896421	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn it! I can't make Pops's ramen without
a shaver box...
3896422	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If I have to make some cheap knockoff
then... Entering this fight was pointless in
the first place!
3896423	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Chef! What are you doing waiting out here?
3896424	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	You two...
3896426	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	It just started. Shun... He knows he can't
win	 but he's going through with it anyway.
3896427	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Shoot! It started already!
3896429	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	The safe...?
3896430	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Come to think of it	 I remember Pops always
smiling whenever he opened it...
3896431	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	The soul of Victory Kitchen? What do you mean?
3896432	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Apparently it's inside the shop safe! It's
something important to Yamagoshi-san.
3896433	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Come to think of it... Pops would often take
something out of there with a big grin
on his face.
3896435	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	*gasp* Okay! I'll get it!
3896436	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hey hey! What's going on? We're in the
middle of shooting!
3896437	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What are you guys doing here?
3896438	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*pant* *pant* Kano-kun! You haven't made the
broth yet	 right!?
3896439	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Uh	 not yet...
3896440	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank god! We made it in time!
3896441	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Shun! I found this in the safe... Use it!
3896450	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This is Pops's...
3896451	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He took care of it all this time...
for me...
3896452	Hiromu Miyazawa	Hmph	 what's special about that musty
old thing...
3896453	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow...
3896454	Hiromu Miyazawa	What...
3896455	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yes!
3896470	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Tsk! What are you expecting shaven bonito
flakes to do?
3896471	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	A good chef doesn't rely on fancy tools or
ingredients. It all boils down to skill.
Don't you know that?
3896472	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You think that makes this the "real" soup?
You really are beyond help	 kid.
3896473	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Food's getting cold.
3896474	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haha! Kano-kun's not fazed a bit!
3896475	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Tch...
3896476	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ahem.
3896477	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Now then	 our contestant's meal is ready for
tasting!
3896478	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The contestant claims to have captured the
authentic flavor of Victory Kitchen. If I
deem that he has truly succeeded...
3896479	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I will say "Thank you" after eating!
3896480	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And now	 the taste test!
3896481	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	This is...!
3896482	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The taste from back then... when I was...
3896483	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	This taste... this is it...! Ah...
3896484	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	...Thank you!
3896485	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Did he just say it? He said it	 right?
3896487	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	No! That was‚Äî! I didn't say anything!
3896488	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I just... said it out of habit! Yeah	 that's
right! I always say that at restaurants!
3896489	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh...?
3896490	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Cuuut! Just cut that part out! Okay	
take two	 roll camera!
3896491	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	O-Oh dear	 the flavor's just not coming
through! Even with the proper tools	 it seems
there's just a lack of talent here!
3896492	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Your bonito flakes have gone to complete
waste! In the end	 this chef was just a kid
playing pretend.
3896493	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I declare this contestant utterly defeated!
3896494	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What the‚Äî!? Stop screwing around! We all
heard you! You said	 "Thank you"!
3896495	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Shut up! Don't step on my lines! It makes it
harder to edit!
3896496	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Miyazawa-san. You lost. Accept it.
3896497	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	This is exactly the authentic flavor of
Victory Kitchen. The flavor Shun wanted
to protect... Pops's flavor!
3896498	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Shut up! Shut it!
3896499	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You trying to get fired	 Masa!? You know
what? You're all fired! The whole staff!
3896500	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Wha‚Äî!?
3896501	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They have nothing to do with this!
3896502	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Huh? They got involved the moment they
sided with you!
3896503	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And guess whose fault that is. If you didn't
oppose my verdict	 Masa and the rest of those
sad sacks wouldn't have to be canned.
3896504	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Because of you	 eeeveryone gets the short
end of the stick. It's sad really!
3896505	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	*gasp*
3896506	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Stop it! You leave Shun alone!
3896507	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Uh wh-wh-what do we have here? You gonna hit
me? G-Go ahead. You'll be the next violent
punk to go viral!
3896508	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ugh	 screw this. I'm calling the cops. Hey	
manager	 get the police over here!
3896509	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I already have evidence of the brat's
assault! Have them take away his little friends
too while they're at it!
3896510	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî!? Us!?
3896511	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You waltzed into the middle of a shoot... You
interfered! Um... That's right	 you committed
a serious obstruction of business!
3896512	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I have my crew as witnesses... Now who do
you think the cops are going to believe?
3896513	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî!?
3896514	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Get a hold of yourself! There's no reason to
drag children into this!
3896515	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is bad. At this rate he's going to call
the authorities on us. We need to get Kano
and escape at once!
3896516	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's get out of here	 Kano-kun!
3896517	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Forget about me. You two run.
3896519	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I can't stand to cause trouble for everyone
anymore. I'll stay and take full
responsibility for this.
3896520	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm sorry for draggin' you guys into this...
Thanks for everything.
3896521	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kano-kun	 please come with us!
3896522	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What if I said there's a way to make him
have a change of heart	 and confess the truth
behind all of his wrongdoing?
3896523	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? If somethin' like that were possible	
I would've already...
3896524	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait. Huh? Who just said that...?
3896525	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 it seems you really can hear my voice.
I knew I sensed potential for hope in you.
3896526	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What...? An owl? Wha‚Äî!? Huh!?
3896527	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 Kano-kun. Let's head outside!
3896528	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If they're really gonna call the cops	 we
should get away from here ASAP	 right?
3896529	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do we do? Can we escape to the
Metaverse?
3896530	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I told you it's too risky. If we can at
least get to the station...
3896531	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How is that owl talking...?
3896532	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Multiple notifications from Pops and
Katayama-san... I made them worry about
me again...
3896533	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? What's this app with the eye icon?
3896550	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's get back to Shinjuku Station. You too	
Kano-kun!
3896551	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Waaah! Wh-Who are you!?
3896552	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Motoha Arai? You know that... Wh- Waaaah!
3896554	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 why are we in our thief outfits? We
didn't use the Metaverse Navigator!
3896555	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Your voice... Is that really you	 Arai?
3896556	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And that means you're... {NAME1}?
3896558	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 really?
3896559	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So you guys are into cosplay...?
3896560	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What? You're not?
3896561	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 that voice is definitely {NAME1}.
3896562	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wonder?
3896563	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What is that	 your stage name? And why are
you talking like that?
3896564	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph... Every time you people see thief
clothes it turns into a "who's the most
confounded" contest...
3896565	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ewwhaa‚Äî!? What is that disgusting hooded
thing!?
3896566	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoooooo!?
3896567	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Who are you calling disgusting!? I'll have
you know this form represents the pinnacle
of panache and refinement!
3896568	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Pssst... Wonder. What's pun ash?
3896569	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My name is Lufel! Fit that into your
noodle-filled skull!
3896570	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 oh	 right...
3896571	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hang on a sec... Where are we? How did we
suddenly end up here?
3896573	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What...?
3896574	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We came in by accident	 but for better or
worse	 we seem to have landed ourselves
inside of Miyazawa's Palace.
3896575	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which one of you activated the Metaverse
Navigator?
3896576	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî!? It wasn't me!
3896578	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Could this be...?
3896579	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's with this poster? Is that... me?
3896580	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch	 Shadows are starting to close in on us.
3896581	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not sure if we'll be able to ensure
Kano's safety. I suggest we get out of the
Palace as soon as possible.
3896582	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right. I know we needed somewhere
to run	 but the middle of a Palace is really
not ideal.
3896583	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're going	 Shun Kano. Come along.
3896584	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî Why? Seriously	 what the heck's going
on here?
3896586	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tch... Okay...
3896589	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The door's open...? But it was locked
before.
3896590	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Food Fight Miyazawa planned to punish
Kano took place in reality	 so his cognition
has changed to reflect that.
3896591	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa's cognition...?
3896592	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can explain later. For now	 let's search
for an alternative exit.
3896620	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What is it?
3896621	Exaggerated Voice	First...
3896666	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Who's there!?
3896631	Exaggerated Voice	...to adorn himself with the blood of
his enemies.
3896622	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Be on your guard. I sense a powerful enemy.
3896623	Exaggerated Voice	Second	 to strike first and win	 villainous
as that may seem.
3896624	Exaggerated Voice	Third	 to fulfill his desire...
3896625	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	...which rivals the brilliance of the
glittering stars in the heavens.
3896664	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Hiromu Miyazawa takes the stage!
3896626	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's him!
3896627	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Miyazawa's Shadow!
3896628	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa...?
3896629	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Serfs	 kill them!
3896630	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 it's a trap!
3896632	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Ahahahahahahaha! How marvelous.
3896633	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	A trap most befitting the vile rats that
dared defile my sacred studio.
3896634	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Agh	 what is this!? A net!?
3896635	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Disgraceful... I was too focused on the
incoming Shadows to notice the trap in time!
3896636	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 use your knife to cut us out
of here!
3896637	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Hahah	 that rope is made with reinforced
thread. A trifling hack and slash isn't
going to cut it.
3896638	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	H-Hey	 are you guys all right!?
3896639	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Look what we have here. Seems the trap
missed our little Shun-kun.
3896640	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	How shall we torture you then? Hahahahah!
3896641	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are you... really Miyazawa? What's with the
weird outfit...?
3896642	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I said it's Miyazawa's Shadow! Essentially a
manifestation of Miyazawa's desire!
3896643	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Manifestation... of desire?
3896645	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	My my	 do you think I intend to let you
insurgents escape? I said kill them.
3896646	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What!? What are they!?
3896647	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Damn! Is this the end...!?
3896648	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	That it is. You rats are hereby sentenced to
death. For the crime of obstruction	 you
shall all face execution.
3896649	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Execution!? The hell is this bastard
talkin' about!?
3896650	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a fortress of his own creation in the
Metaverse... He has free reign to do whatever
he wants. That includes destroying us!
3896651	Shadow Mi<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>azawa	Ahahahahahahaha! That's right! I can do
anything I want here! This studio was
designed by me	 for me!
3896652	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Do you know what that means	 Shun-kun?
Once again	 thanks to you	 everyone has
ended up worse.
3896653	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ngh!
3896654	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Ever since your water-splashing temper
tantrum	 your precious shop has been ripped
apart to the brink of collapse.
3896655	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	And you managed to drag your precious Pops
and Masa-kun down with you.
3896656	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I... did...
3896658	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Hey hey hey! I'm in the middle of my lines!
No talking on set!
3896659	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	And what's more	 now with Heritage Kitchen
also in my hands	 poor old Pops's heart is
at the breaking point!
3896660	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Every time you get involved you cause misery
for everyone around you! Isn't that right	
Shun-kun!?
3896661	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	*whimper*
3896662	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No! None of this is Kano-kun's fault! This
was all part of your plan!
3896663	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I said quiet on set! How dare you interrupt
the leading role's lines!
3700367	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah!
3700607	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Arai!
3700741	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Looks like Loudmouth Brat #2 needs a lesson
in set etiquette. Hehehehe...
3896667	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tch!
3896668	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Please... You can take out all your anger on
me. Just please leave them alone!
3896669	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Huuuh? I didn't quite catch that?
3896670	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Stop it! Please stop!
3896671	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch... There's no way to fight back with
this net in the way!
3896672	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm so sorry	 you guys... This is all
because I went against Miyazawa...!
3896674	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Why...? Why are you defending me...?
3896675	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	That's right! A miserable leech like you
doesn't deserve anyone's kindness!
3896676	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	You incurred my wrath	 and now you are bound
to tear down everyone around you. Isn't that
how it always goes?
3896677	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tch...
3896678	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	All of it is your fault! All because of you
and your ridiculous pride over a cheap bowl
of noodles.
3896679	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My... pride...?
3896680	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Yes! Where's your "authentic flavor" now?
Out with the bathwater	 'cause you spoiled
the pot for everyone!
3896681	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I... did...?
3896682	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Haha! Don't you get it? Everyone sacrificed
things they cared about to protect you.
There's no way they'd forgive you!
3896683	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Not after all you've done for the sake of
your precious "pride"! A brat like you
doesn't know the meaning of the word!
3896684	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	H-He's right... I ruined the lives of
everyone around me...
3896685	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All because of my pride... everyone...
3896686	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Even {NAME1} and Arai... If I hadn't
dragged them into this	 this never
would have...!
3896688	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's right! We're here because we wanted
to be!
3896689	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You didn't do anything to hurt us	 Kano-kun!
We chose to help you by our own free will	
because that's what we wanted to do!
3896690	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You guys...
3896691	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Remember! Yamagoshi-san and Masa-san have
pride in their ramen!
3896692	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you gonna turn your back on that!?
3896693	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	*gasp*
3896694	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You know	 this is the ramen my late wife
loved the most.
3896695	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Somehow the customers too... They always
break out in a huge smile whenever they
eat it.
3896696	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	That's why I've got to protect this flavor
for the rest of my life. It's my purpose...
My pride.
3896697	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	What do you think of my original ramen?
3896698	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Mmm! This is incredible	 Masa-san. Why
haven't you added it to the menu yet?
3896699	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Haha	 thank you. But it's still not as good
as Pops's.
3896593	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I want to use everything Pops taught me to
create a ramen I can be proud to call
my own...
3896594	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Then I can make everyone smile with my
cooking. Just like Pops hoped.
3896595	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's right... We were all proud of
that flavor...
3896596	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Making customers smile with our ramen...
That was our purpose!
3896598	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ngh!
3896599	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	What are you blubbering about!? And you two!
Shut these idiots up already!
3896600	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agh...! Shun... Kano! Stop blaming yourself!
3896601	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The hope that you all called your "pride"...
Just who is it that stole it away from you!?
3896602	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	S-Stole?
3896603	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Hey	 hey	 hey	 hey! Trying to shift the
blame onto me	 are you!?
3896604	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	If you hadn't defied me	 everything would
have worked itself out!
3896605	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Singing the praises of "real flavor from
real chefs" like an idiot.
3896606	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Just looking at you makes me sick! I already
gave up on trying to be real!
3896607	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	But in the end	 all those people who tried
to crush me...
3896608	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Calling me a fake... I showed them what a
fake truly looks like! Ahahahahahahaha!
3896609	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 that's why you targeted me?
3896610	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Hm?
3896611	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Just because you threw away what you
cared about...
3896612	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How many shops have you shut down? How many
smiles have you wiped away?
3896613	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How many chefs have you stolen pride and
purpose away from!?
3896614	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How many people's dreams have you killed to
spite the one you threw away yourself!?
3896615	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Wha‚Äî!?
3896617	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I won't give up anymore!
3896618	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Everything this bastard has stolen away...
I'm taking it back!
3896700	Mandrin	You finally said it	 eh?
3896701	Mandrin	You tried to throw everything away...
Your pride	 your hope	 your will	 even your life...
3896702	Mandrin	But you finally figured it out... Wallowing
in guilt isn't going to change anything!
3896704	Mandrin	The bad men won't go away if you shut your eyes...
They demand unlawful recompense. You can't play nice!
3896705	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That mask...!
3896706	Mandrin	Your days of giving up are over... From now
on surreptitiously	 audaciously	 rakishly...
3896707	Mandrin	We shall make monarchs stand and deliver!
3896708	Mandrin	Now do you remember me? I am thou...
3896709	Shun Kano	...And thou art... I!
3896710	Shadow Miyazawa	Gah!
3896711	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp* Kano-kun has a Persona too!?
3896712	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This power... This passion for life...!
3896713	Shun Kano	Well now	 I think I get the picture.
3896714	Shun Kano	This is a stick-up! Go	 <color=#FF423F>Mandrin</color>!
3896715	Shadow Miyazawa	No no no	 my face! You scratched my
magnificent face! Gagh!
3896716	Shadow Miyazawa	The lead role can't go on camera like this!
Finish them while I get my makeup fixed!
3896717	Shun Kano	Thanks	 guys. I finally get it.
3896718	Shun Kano	Some things are worth protectin'... even if I've
gotta lean on others. So	 will you help me?
3896720	Shun Kano	Heh	 that's what I like to hear.
3896721	Shun Kano	What's with all the sour faces...
3896722	Shun Kano	How'd you like a mouthful of lead!?
3896723	Shun Kano	Let's go! Mandrin!
3896750	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wanna see my skills!?
3896751	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Boiled or fried	 I'm servin' bottomless
bowls of pain!
3896760	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nice! We managed to make it out of that mess!
All thanks to you	 Kano-kun!
3896761	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What're you talkin' about? I should be
thankin' you. So	 thank you... for havin'
my back.
3896762	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Agh	 what the...? I suddenly feel
so tired...
3896763	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your Persona awakened and you fought in
battle right afterwards. You're bound to
be exhausted.
3896764	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 your battle prowess was singularly
impressive	 Shun Kano. I have great
expectations for your skills.
3896765	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I know we were just battling together and
all	 but seriously	 the hell's with
this blowhard?
3896767	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well... That's not incorrect per se	 but I'm
not sure that description will do him
any good.
3896768	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You...! I... I've been trying hard to forget
about that...
3896769	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha. I'm telling you	 that's what anyone
would think when they first see you.
3896770	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyhoo. Kano is in no state to stick around
here	 so we should get back to the real
world and...
3896771	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nooooo!
3896772	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wha‚Äî Don't shout like that. We're in
enemy territory.
3896773	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 sorry! But I just remembered...
3896774	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	School! We skipped our afternoon classes!
3896775	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh... That's right. I'm sorry for gettin'
you guys in trouble.
3896777	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 for real. You didn't ask us to chase
after you.
3896778	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks.
3896779	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Still	 we should head back to school. We
left our bags and everything there.
3896780	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By the way	 Kano-kun. Ms. Katayama was
worried about you when she saw the video.
3896781	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Katayama-san was?
3896782	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. She's the reason we found out about
the Food Fight announcement in the
first place.
3896783	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Really... Okay	 I'll have to apologize when
we get back to school.
3896785	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 I agree. In that case...
3896786	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What the‚Äî!? He's a car!?
3896787	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Get in.
3896800	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is this Shibuya...? But we were in Shinjuku.
3896801	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 thank goodness. Looks like the trains
are running normally again!
3896802	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 {NAME1}	 can you explain just what
the hell is goin‚Äî
3896803	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall I do the honors?
3896804	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wah! That owl's talking! Wait... Are you...
Lufel?
3896805	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I am. My form differs between the real world
and the Metaverse. Now	 allow me to enlighten
you with the origin of your thief suits‚Äî
3896806	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hold that thought! School's our top priority
right now. Classes will finish if we're just
standing around here all day!
3896808	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All right. You better fill me in later	 okay?
3896830	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	You three! Where have you been?
Skipping class without permission...
3896831	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 Ms. Katayama! We just‚Äî We um‚Äî
Well	 we...
3896832	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm so sorry	 Ms. Katayama!
3896833	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Could you please let us off without asking
what happened?
3896834	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I... We... We all did what we thought was
the right thing.
3896835	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll take responsibility for everything.
Please accept my apology.
3896836	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Kano-kun...
3896837	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	All right. I won't ask. I'll give an
explanation to the other teachers.
3896838	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	You can all still make it in time for sixth
period. Hurry over to class now	 all right?
3896839	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay!
3896840	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	And... promise me. The next time you three
find yourselves in any kind of trouble	 go to
an adult for help right away. Got it?
3896842	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	All right	 get to class.
3896843	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you so much!
3896844	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's get back to the classroom	 {NAME2}!
Meet us at the rooftop after sixth period	
Kano-kun!
3896845	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Hey	 no running in the halls!
3896846	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	These kids...
3896847	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Hehe	 but it does take me back.
3896870	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is this for real?
3896871	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Metaverse Navigators	 Mementos	 Palaces	
Treasures	 and Miyazawa's... Shadow?
3896872	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know it sounds kinda hard to believe when
you lay it all out like that...
3896873	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 I believe it.
3896874	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Mandrin	 our battle in the Metaverse	 it was
all real.
3896875	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The Phantom Thieves... So that means what
went down with that Subway Slammer guy was
your doing?
3896877	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I see. Considering the incident with Noge
too	 I believe you.
3896878	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's all the information we have to offer
on the subject. Now allow me to ask you
a question...
3896879	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shun Kano	 would you like to help with our
next job?
3896880	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You mean thieving?
3896881	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's the idea. Of course growing our ranks
would improve our fighting capabilities...
3896882	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And now that you know of our identities	
bringing you into the fold would be
advantageous in another sense as well.
3896883	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3896884	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Remember what I said when we were up here
before? About wishing Miyazawa would admit
to his wrongdoing.
3896885	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Crazy to think I said that to one of the
guys who changed Kiuchi's heart.
3896886	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 can we change Miyazawa's heart
too	 {NAME1}?
3896888	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then count me in!
3896889	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right on!
3896890	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I wanna join the Phantom Thieves.
3896891	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I wanna help you stop scumbags like Miyazawa
from stealing anyone else's hope.
3896892	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 welcome aboard.
3896893	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Woohoo! New member!
3896894	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Now we'll have to think of a code name
for Kano-kun.
3896895	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Code name?
3896896	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To protect our real names while working. A
phantom thief cannot reveal their
true identity.
3896897	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa	 you guys are legit.
3896898	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm Closer	 by the way.
3896899	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Call me Cattle. {PLAYER_NAME} goes
by Wonder.
3896900	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We all picked things we thought sounded
mysterious.
3896901	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Mysterious	 huh...
3896902	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then how about "Shoyu"?
3896903	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Shoyu? You mean like the soy sauce? Why?
3896904	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	In ramen and other foods	 one drop of the
stuff brings the whole dish together. I'd say
that makes it pretty mysterious.
3896906	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What? No good? Don't you think it suits me?
Being a chef and all.
3896907	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's... try it out a bit.
3896908	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Shoyu! Go get it!
3896909	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It sounds like you're asking someone to
buy groceries.
3896910	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 I can't call you that...
3896911	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey!
3896912	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 I don't intend to criticize your
creativity	 but it just lacks the panache of
a phantom thief.
3896913	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I recommend choosing something more Germanic
or Latin inspired to match ours. Otherwise	
it would feel out of place.
3896914	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's a good point...
3896915	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 shoyu is just called soy sauce in
English	 so how about "Soy"?
3896916	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Soy? That could work!
3896918	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Great. Oh	 and Arai	 we're the same age and
all	 so you can drop the "-kun."
3896919	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	True. I'll call you Shun then! And you can
call me Motoha!
3896920	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	U-Uh	 sure... Motoha.
3896921	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then I'll call you {NAME2}. Glad to
work with ya	 {NAME2}.
3896922	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By the way	 is it just me or was
Ms. Katayama super chill today? She took
Shun's excuse without batting an eye.
3896923	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She's a great teacher. She really saved my
hide once too.
3896924	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san has a hot-headed side like me.
She just gets it	 so I don't ever feel the
need to lie to her.
3896925	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 really? In our class she just seems
pissed all the time...
3896926	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait	 do you guys not know about her past?
She was pretty well-known for‚Äî
3896927	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh! It's Masa-san.
3896928	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This is Shun.
3896929	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sorry	 Masa-san	 I didn't mean to run off
without cleaning up from the Food Fight...
3896930	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Don't worry about that. It was all Miyazawa
and his big mouth. After you left	 he really
made quite the scene...
3896931	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But his own crew told him off	 and kept him
from calling the police.
3896932	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh...! That's good...
3896933	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But he was fuming when he left. He'll
probably try to stir up some kind of
trouble again.
3896934	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	But Shun	 you don't need to get involved
with him anymore.
3896935	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 but!
3896936	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	We'll take care of the rest. Let us adults
carry the load.
3896937	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Masa-san...
3896938	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Your soup was really incredible	 Shun.
Thanks for reminding me of what's
really important.
3896939	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Once this all blows over	 come back for a
bite	 okay? Later!
3896940	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What'd Masa-san say?
3896941	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They stopped Miyazawa from calling the
cops on us.
3896942	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really? Thank god!
3896943	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But... That doesn't fix the fact that he
stole the shop and changed the soup.
3896944	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We have to change his heart. First	 we need
to go looking for this Treasure thing	 right?
3896945	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 but infiltrating the Palace will
certainly be risky. We ought to
prepare thoroughly.
3896946	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fortunately	 with the police issue
eliminated	 we've freed up time to make the
proper arrangements.
3896947	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll leave the decision of when we should
head for Miyazawa's Palace to you	 {NAME2}.
3896948	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All right. Countin' on ya	 {NAME2}.
3896949	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay! From here on out the Phantom Thieves
are four members strong. Now let's change
some hearts!
3896848	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Goooo team!
3896950	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can sense the Treasure. It seems it's on
the <color=#FF423F>top floor</color> of that castle.
3896951	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So if we steal that thing	 it'll change
Miyazawa's heart? You said it was the reason
for his twisted desires	 right?
3896952	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed.
3896953	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyway	 don't you guys think this Palace is
kinda weird? With the castle set	 and the
movie posters...
3896954	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi's Palace being a baseball stadium I
get	 but... What	 is Miyazawa just into
period pieces or something?
3896956	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. So he puts on a character for his
shows. That likely has something to do with
the cause of his corruption.
3896957	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hah. Only Miyazawa'd be satisfied playing
dress-up as king of a made-up castle.
3896958	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Welp	 let's go find that Treasure	 huh? For
Pops and Masa-san too.
3896990	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A dead end?
3896991	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 that means this is the place	 right	
Cattle?
3896992	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. I can sense it. Miyazawa's Treasure
is here.
3896993	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 where though...?
3896995	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's right. The next step is sending the
calling card to make the Treasure
materialize.
3896996	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Calling card?
3896997	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that we've secured our route to the
Treasure	 I'll explain the details once we
return to reality.
3896998	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Leader	 it's up to you whether we continue
exploring or return to the real world now.
3897030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You like sweet stuff	 huh	 Shun?
3897031	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 I get pretty hungry after using
my head.
3897032	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Since desserts are outside my area of
expertise	 I can enjoy them without
over-thinkin' how they were made.
3897034	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I get all nitpicky about savory dishes. The
source of the ingredients	 the way they're
cut	 and stuff like that...
3897035	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahhh	 'cause you see it from a chef's
perspective.
3897036	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyhoo	 what's it you were sayin' about
makin' the Treasure materialize?
3897037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right	 I will explain.
3897038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First we need to agree on changing the
Palace ruler's heart by unanimous decision.
3897039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Forcibly remolding another human's mind is
not an act that should be taken lightly.
3897040	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ahhh...
3897041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 what say all of you? Are you in favor of
the change of heart or not?
3897042	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Absolutely in favor. I have no objections.
3897043	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Of course for Pops and Masa-san's sake...
but also for all the other shops he's
hurt too.
3897044	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I agree. We can't let Miyazawa go on
like this.
3897046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Okay	 I'm in favor as well. That means we've
reached a consensus. We will change
Miyazawa's heart.
3897047	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the next step is the calling card.
3897048	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Once it's delivered and the target
recognizes their Treasure is under threat of
being stolen	 it will materialize.
3897049	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It'd be best if we could get it to him
directly	 but obviously we don't know where
he lives	 so...
3897050	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Even if we knew where he worked	 he's
always runnin' around filming at different
locations.
3897051	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! What if Lufel drops them from the sky
above the station like last time?
3897052	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I already told {NAME2}	 but I am not going
to expose myself like that again.
3897053	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If our true identities get revealed	 we're
finished. It's too risky for many reasons...
3897054	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...but mostly because it hurt my muscles.
3897055	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oof	 that's so real!
3897056	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 okay	 fine. Hmmm	 what should we
do then?
3897057	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 it's a notification for Miyazawa's
channel! He uploaded some new video!
3897058	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Afternoon	 everyone! This is Katana Tongue
Miyazawaaaa!
3897059	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	About the upcoming Food Fight video you've
all been patiently awaiting... I am so sorry!
3897060	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Due to technical difficulties we were unable
to capture the fight on film! Please forgive
me as I present just the results...
3897061	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The contestant was	 of course	 defeated!
Their taste was an embarrassing offense to
a true palate!
3897062	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That asshole...
3897063	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 it's not like I expected him to tell
the truth anyway.
3897064	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Now	 in place of that video	 I will be doing
a live broadcast on the channel!
3897065	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	At the same Victory Kitchen shop from my
last Food Fight	 I will be unveiling a huuuge
announcement!
3897066	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I'm bringing that incredible flavor all over
the country in the form of a brand new chai‚Äî
Whoops	 can't say any more!
3897067	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Look out for the details on my social media
in the coming days! I hope you're all
excited!
3897068	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Anyhoodle	 this is Katana Tongue Miyazawa	
signing off!
3897069	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Can't say any more? He basically just
spilled the whole thing! A chain restaurant?
Are you kidding me!?
3897070	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I can't let him spread that fake soup around
the country under Pops's name!
3897071	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 doesn't that mean Miyazawa will
definitely be at Victory Kitchen on the
day of the broadcast?
3897072	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh...! I still have the key to Victory
Kitchen too!
3897073	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If I sneak in there the night before and
leave the calling card	 then...
3897074	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Miyazawa will definitely see it!
3897076	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All right	 sounds like a plan.
3897077	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Before Miyazawa announces the date	 let's
all make sure we've prepared everything we‚Äî
3897078	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait! One more thing!
3897079	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes?
3897080	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	With Shun on the team now and the Phantom
Thieves getting bigger	 what do you guys
think about making a logo for ourselves?
3897081	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Logo...?
3897082	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You mean designing some kind of symbol to
stand as the mark of the Phantom Thieves?
3897083	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes	 exactly! Like how baseball uniforms
have logos that unify the team!
3897085	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Woo! Then it's settled.
3897086	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But now the question is	 who's going to draw
it? I myself wouldn't know where to begin
with detailed work like that.
3897087	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Same here. My grades in art class are
always crap.
3897088	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think my drawing on Kiuchi's calling card
made it pretty clear to everyone where my
skills land so...
3896849	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 great leader Wonder-sama! Please deliver
us from crappy artwork!
3896853	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? You'll do it!? Yes! You're the best	
{NAME2}! I'll go buy some pens and paper!
3896854	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I had no idea you possessed that kind of
ability. Well then	 we'll leave the design
of our thieves' emblem to you.
3896855	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Make us somethin' good	 {NAME2}!
3896856	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now all there is to do is wait for the broadcast date to be announced.
3896857	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is our second job as the Phantom
Thieves. To get the world's attention	 let's
make sure to do it in style.
3896858	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like the announcement for
Miyazawa's live broadcast is coming soon...
Are you ready for it?
3897090	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Ahhhhh. Shaking up the food world as a
famous critic is just so exhausting...
3897091	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I gave another shop a thorough slicing
today	 but the question is... how do we make
money off it?
3897092	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	We're filming at Victory Kitchen after this	
right?
3897093	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Yes	 sir. And I'm sure yesterday's social
media announcement has got all your fans on
the edges of their seats.
3897094	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	We've also paid people to line up outside
the restaurant.
3897095	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Heheh	 you've really turned your attitude
around	 huh?
3897096	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Well	 let's get over there. I'm sure the
news about the chain deal's bound to blow
everyone away.
3897097	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I can hear the sweet jingle of money rolling
in already.
3897098	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Well helloooo there	 thank you for calling!
I'm sorry	 this is about the Food Fight
video	 isn't it?
3897099	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yes	 we filmed it	 but there was a mistake
we just couldn't edit around...
3897100	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Huh? O-Ohhh	 the replacement we talked
about. Ummm	 well	 obviously things didn't
work out with the Food Fight	 but...
3897101	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I have photos and plenty of other evidence
we could use to get the firestorm going...
Right?
3897102	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	No no no	 nothing's gonna change my mind.
I'm nothing like that washed up
baseball hack!
3897103	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The fame that eluded me for so long is
finally mine thanks to Divine Justice...!
3897104	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	So once I find you your replacement	 you'll
propose my film to the entertainment
production committee...? Hello...?
3897105	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Oh sure	 hang up on me	 why don't you!?
3897106	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Whatever. Money'll start flooding in anytime
now. That ought to show them...
3897107	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>aff	Live in three... two...
3897108	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Helloooo	 everyone! Welcome to Katana Tongue

3897112	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Victory Kitchen	 the shop entrusted to me
after its owner fell gravely ill...

let's head inside!
3897115	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	My my	 what a crowd! Proof that the flavor
we worked so hard to perfect is loved
by many.
3897116	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Hello there	 'scuse me!
3897117	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	What the‚Äî!?
3897118	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	What the hell is this!? This was not in
the script...!
3897119	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Sir Hiromu Miyazawa, celebrity critic,
sinner of vanity, lying bastard.
3897120	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You have robbed countless chefs of their
pride and purpose, and wiped the smiles off
customers' faces.
3897121	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	You are a crook who defrauds the public‚Äî
lining your pockets and padding your ego with
the hopes you've stolen from them.
3897122,Hiromu Miyaz<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>wa,For this	 you will not go unpunished. We	
the Phantom Thieves	 will take your twisted
desires without fail."
3897123	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Whaaat is thiiiiiis!?
3897124	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And this dumbass symbol...!
3897125	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Huh!? These weren't some surprise you
prepared for the broadcast	 sir!?
3897126	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	That's why we didn't take them down...
3897127	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Y-You idiot! Of course it isn't! Take this
all down at once! And stop the camera!
3897128	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Take my desires	 you say? Don't make
me laugh!
3897129	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	After all this time I finally got my break...
I'm one step away from stardom...! You think
I'd ever let you take that from me!?
3897130	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Plant	Wow	 I was not expecting that. What's the
Phantom Thieves anyway?
3897131	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Plant	Oh	 I recognize this! There was a calling
card just like this for the Subway Slammer!
3897132	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Okay... Miyazawa has most certainly seen the
calling card. With this	 the Treasure should
have manifested in the Metaverse.
3897133	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And he disgraced himself in front of his
precious live audience. That was a
nice touch.
3897134	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But the real fight's still ahead. Are you
ready	 {NAME2}?
3897150	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There it is! The Treasure!
3897151	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's the Treasure? Looks like some kind
of film reel...
3897152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Based on the Palace's interior	 it would
seem the source of Miyazawa's warped desire
stems from movies.
3897154	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! There're no Shadows around. This is
our chance!
3897155	E<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>aggerated Voice	First	 to adorn himself with the blood of
his enemies...
3897156	E<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>aggerated Voice	Second	 to speak first and win	 villainous
as that may seem...
3897157	E<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>aggerated Voice	Third	 to fulfill his desire...
3897158	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Which rivals the brilliance of the
glittering sta‚Äî Ach!?
3897159	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Woo! Strike one!
3897160	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Aghhh...! How dare you sully the money maker
of the world's next big super star!?
3897161	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	And how dare you disrupt the lead's critical
scene!? What is this	 amateur hour!?
3897162	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Who cares!? You've been destroying
everyone's hopes and dreams	 so shut it!
3897163	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hand it over	 Hiromu Miyazawa. All the hope
you've stolen. Now!
3897164	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Hah! There you go again	 ooon and ooon about
hopes and "dreams" and "rainbows"! The
only ones buying that fairytale nonsense...
3897165	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Are gullible little brats like you. If you
knew how the world really works you'd have
given up already.
3897166	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	You stinking rug rats don't have a clue. The
pen may be mightier than the sword	 but this
blade will write you out of existence!
3897190	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Can you hear it? That's the voice of my
demonic blade	 aching to drain the lifeblood
from your wretched bodies!
3897191	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Guess we're gonna have to fight!
3897192	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Just fry him till he's crispy	 but not
scorched	 right?
3897194	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Order up!
3897195	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Tch... How dare you try to upstage the main
character! You damn bit players!
3897196	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Ah...! Here's an idea. How about a few
flavor substitutes to bring out the umami!
3897197	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is getting out of hand! Now there are
three of them!
3897198	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can barely stomach just one of him.
This is bad...
3897199	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So you're just gonna hide among your fakes?
You coward!
3897200	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Gah! H-How did you find me? Is my star power
just that bright...?
3897201	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Somethin' smells. Must be your dirty rotten
lies!
3897202	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Ahahaha! I got you... You can't tell the
real thing from a cheap copy after all!
3897203	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Fools... Defeating my decoy only restores my
power. Ignorance is a sin	 isn't it?
Ahahaha!
3897220	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Gyah...! This... wasn't in... my
screenplay...
3897221	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Your screenplay's a bloated vanity project.
A sham hacked together with lies and
tissue paper.
3897222	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I have no mercy for you. For all the hopes
you've stolen... Confess!
3897224	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Aaah... Aaaaaah...!
3897225	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	No...! No! You can't! It's my only...!
3897226	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	If that's how it's gonna be...
3897227	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I'll have to show you my real ugly side!
3897228	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's happening!?
3897229	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What is it?
3897230	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Did he unleash his true form!?
3897231	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Good. I'm sick of fighting a phony.
3897232	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	You smug little rats...! I'll cut you all
down to si‚Äî
3897233	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll flay you and your fake flavor fair
and square.
3897234	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Bring it on!
3700913	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	I'll chop you all up into pieces!
3897235	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Slash	 slash	 slash	 slash	 slaaash!
3897236	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	I'll slice your precious pride into
mincemeat!
3900049	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	You cheeky little brats...! I'll chop you all
to bits!
3897237	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	It's time for the grand finale... This will
be my award-winning scene!
3897238	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	With this blade	 harder than steel...
I'll put an end to you villains!
3897239	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Who're you callin'... The real villain who
stole the desires of so many people is you!
3897240	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 this doesn't look good!
3897241	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That was bad... Everyone all right?
3897242	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm holdin' on somehow. But if we take
another hit like that...
3897243	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He won't be able to do that again anytime
soon. Look for an opening and press
the attack!
3897244	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Hmm. Is it time to roll credits already?
3897245	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	An epic climax needs some supporting
characters as well... Heh	 the star will take
a back seat for now.
3897246	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Just wait until my grand re-entrance...
Oops	 no spoilers!
3897247	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hidin' back there like a coward...! Come out
and face us fair and square!
3897248	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We don't know what he'll do. Stay calm and
observe the enemy's movements!
3897249	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Shit	 shit	 SHIT! Such lousy acting...
You amateurs have no right to stand here!
3897250	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	You guys are just disposable extras to make
the real star shine!
3897251	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Everything in this world is my
shining stage...
3897252	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Anyone who sullies my stage? Die
pathetically	 miserably	 and without desire!
3897253	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Hahahaha!
3897254	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What!? What's he doing now?
3897255	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Looks like he's finally stopped hidin'. That
means we can go all out!
3897256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 wait. I sense the same... or even
greater power from him than before.
3897257	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keep your guard up! Get ready!
3897258	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Well? How d'you like that!?
3897259	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Climax after climax... This is the true
essence of a silver screen actor!
3897260	A<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gipan	Grrr...!? N-no way	 me	 the leading man...
forced into a corner...!?
3897261	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*pant* *pant* Let me... take five...
3897262	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There	 now's our chance! Take him down!
3897263	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Let me do this. I'll go somewhere I can get
a clear shot.
3897264	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You want to go on your own? It could be
a risk... What do you think	 Wonder?
3897266	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Got it	 leave it to me!
3897365	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He changed back...?
3897366	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes	 this means we stopped the Shadow from
rampaging! Now we just have to steal
the Treasure!
3897367	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh.
3897368	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Uch... Ngh...
3897369	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Agh... I can't move anymore... You win...
Just take it and get out of here...
3897371	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Could you hold on a sec	 Wonder? There's
somethin' I've gotta ask him.
3897267	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 Miyazawa.
3897268	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	What...?
3897269	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tell me why this film was so important
to you.
3897270	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Huh...? Why do you care?
3897271	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I want to know why you started crying at
the Food Fight.
3897272	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	......
3897273	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I always... dreamed of being a movie star.
3897274	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I left the countryside for the city	 hoping
to become a star on the silver screen... Like
the ones I saw in films as a child...
3897275	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Heh... But I was never that good-looking...
so the only roles I ever got were background
extras...
3897276	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	No matter how hard I tried	 I could never
become a "real" actor	 worthy of a
starring role...
3897277	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3897278	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Always rejected... Always broke...
Always starving...
3897279	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I had to throw away my pride to survive...
I'd suck up to all the actors who made
it big...
3897280	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Get them to buy me expensive meals...
All the while crying to myself over how
pathetic I was...
3897281	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	But thanks to that... I was able to develop
my palate...
3897282	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And that's why you became a
celebrity critic?
3897283	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	At first it was just local TV programs...
I started off giving proper	 honest reviews.
3897284	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Over time I started to gain popularity... But
as I discovered different restaurants	 I
found myself getting so irritated...
3897286	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	The chefs in the kitchen... They shined...
just like the real stars I used to idolize...
3897287	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	With a twinkle in their eye and pride in
their heart	 they followed their own path
without looking back...
3897288	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So that's what made you target
Victory Kitchen?
3897289	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	Yes... You splashing water on me had nothing
to do with it. Victory Kitchen's authentic
flavor made me feel all the more phony...
3897290	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I couldn't face the truth... That I was a
fake... That I threw away my pride as
an actor...
3897291	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3897292	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I'm sorry	 Shun-kun... I'm sorry to everyone
at Victory Kitchen... I'm the real fake...
3897293	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I told lie after lie and got so caught in my
own web that I couldn't turn back...
3897294	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I'm nothing but a foolish	 rotten	
asinine... villain. I don't deserve to
live anymore...
3897295	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm not going to forgive you. But...
3897296	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You... acknowledged my ramen. You couldn't
lie to yourself about what you tasted.
3897297	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The reason you've made it as far as you
have... is because of something you couldn't
turn your back on in that moment...
3897298	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Your tongue. Your real sense of taste you've
spent years cultivating.
3897299	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	*gasp*
3897300	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No one is born a true professional at
anything.
3897301	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The strong desire to become one... is what
gives a person pride and purpose.
3897302	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	The desire to become one...
3897303	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	As people	 we have all these dreams and
aspirations	 but we also know that some
things in life don't always work out.
3897304	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We can't control what talents we're born
with	 or if some accident leaves us injured
and aimless. Sometimes we just quit...
3897305	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But we never let go of hope. We find new
purpose for ourselves	 put all our energy
into chasing it	 and keep on living.
3897306	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I understand how desperate it feels to
struggle like that... but it doesn't make
stealing hope from other people right.
3897307	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	......
3897308	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You should apologize to every shop you made
suffer	 and take back all your false reviews.
3897309	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tell the truth about everything that
happened... Seriously reflect on your
actions	 and atone for your crimes...
3897310	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then come back to my shop as a true
celebrity critic. I'll be the judge of what a
proud gourmet celebrity you've become.
3897311	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	*gasp*
3897312	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And if you end up broke	 I'll give you a
bowl of ramen on the house.
3897313	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	One so delicious it makes you cry.
3897314	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	*sob*
3897315	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	You kids really are optimistic...
3897316	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	But I guess <color=#FF423F>they</color> cut ties with me anyway	
so now is a good time to start over
from scratch...
3897317	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Miyazawa	I'm sorry... Truly... I'll confess to
everything. I'll make it all right again...
3897318	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He vanished...?
3897319	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. The Shadow returned to the real
Miyazawa's heart.
3897321	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks. Sorry for dragging things out.
3897322	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I didn't want to end it by just beating him
up... I wanted to understand where he was
coming from before changing his heart.
3897323	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Waaah! Is this the same thing that happened
with Kiuchi?
3897324	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 the Palace is collapsing. We have to
take the Treasure and get out of here!
3897325	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Collapsing...?
3897326	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Soy	 hurry! Stick around and you'll end
up a pancake!
3897327	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî!? Start with that!
3897330	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Saaafe! That was really close!
3897331	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Haaah... I think hangin' around with you
guys has really increased my stamina...
3897332	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank god this Treasure wasn't as big as
the last one.
3897333	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh right! Where's the Treasure!?
3897334	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here.
3897335	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's Miyazawa's...
3897337	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? What do you mean?
3897338	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Apparently there are seven Treasures in
total. So there are five more Palace rulers
out there somewhere.
3897339	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Seriously!? That's a long way to go. And it
means there are more people out there
like Miyazawa?
3897340	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. The police won't do anything about
them	 so that leaves it to the
Phantom Thieves.
3897341	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By the way	 Cattle. Have any more memories
come back to you?
3897342	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes...
3897343	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But to be frank	 they're quite jumbled.
I think I may have been... wrong.
3897345	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm. That's weird. Wouldn't expect to hear
Cattle say something like that.
3897346	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't have a calm discussion standing
here like this. Let's talk about it once we
leave the Metaverse.
3897349	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait...
3897350	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Where did we go wrong...?
3897351	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wonder	 stop...!
3897352	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We don't wanna forget you!
3897353	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's wrong? You okay?
3897354	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ha	 even our fearless leader's exhausted	
huh?
3897355	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You were staring into space again.
Is everything all right?
3897356	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 I'm sure Wonder must be tired too.
He's always busting his butt as leader.
3897357	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Need to lean on my shoulder?
3897359	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay. Well	 just lemme know if you need
a hand.
3897360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're about to enter a wider area	 so we'll
use my car form from there.
3897361	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks Cattle! I'm actually pretty wiped
too...
3897380	Introverted Girl	I can't believe it's this late...
3897381	Introverted Girl	Ugh... They took up so much time making
small talk after the meeting...
3897382	Introverted Girl	My editor is such a Menace...
3897383	Introverted Girl	Huh?
3897384	Introverted Girl	What is this?
3897389	Introverted Girl	Ah!
3897385	Introverted Girl	Ah!
3897386	Introverted Girl	I-I'm fine!
3897387	Introverted Girl	Sorry	 that was my bad!
3897390	Introverted Girl	Hey...
3897388	Introverted Girl	Ah! I've gotta grab my stuff!
3898000	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Miyazawa's Treasure... This is what twisted
his desires	 huh?
3898001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Something wrong	 Soy?
3898002	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... I mean	 no.
3898003	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I was just thinkin'... Obviously I can't
condone anything he's done	 and I don't
regret changing his heart either.
3898004	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But with all his hope and passion
for acting...
3898005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If things had gone well for him	 do ya think
he'd have turned out differently...?
3898006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right... I wonder the same thing about
Kiuchi. Seems like he loved baseball ever
since he was a kid.
3898007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's the passion that drove him to become
a professional player	 and ultimately
corrupted his desires...
3898008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know	 the first time I heard Awilda's
voice	 I felt like I found answers
for myself.
3898009	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What it is I really wanna do... What's so
important I can't throw it away...
3898010	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It was the same for me.
3898011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's hard to explain	 but I feel like
desire itself isn't always a bad thing.
3898012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Corrupted desires...
3898013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! I didn't know you could speak through
there like that	 Cattle.
3898014	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	O-Oh right... We're kind of inside Cattle's
body... Sort of...
3898015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 eyes on the road please.
3898016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I was saying...
3898017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hypothetically speaking... And I mean	
hypothetically...
3898018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What if someone were... making people's
desires get corrupted?
3898019	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? "Making" them get corrupted?
3898021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's just speculation	 but... when I touched
Miyazawa's Treasure I...
3898022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cattle...?
3898023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Forget it. Like I said	 it's pure
speculation. I shouldn't be sharing
unverified information with you.
3898024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Caaattle! You can't say mysterious stuff and
then expect us to forget about it!
3898025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sorry... You're right.
3898026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	When I touched Miyazawa's Treasure...
3898027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sensed the influence of another
human being.
3898028	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What...?
3898029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 from my logic... I believe there was
someone pulling his strings from behind
the scenes.
3898030	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pulling his strings?
3898031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In other words	 a person who purposely
corrupted Miyazawa's desires and caused his
Treasure to form.
3898032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You mean like...!
3898034	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa whoa whoa! You mean someone made
Miyazawa do all those bad things!?
3898035	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then... Kiuchi too!? Someone intentionally
corrupted him!?
3898036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I told you	 I'm not certain. If only I could
remember everything...
3898037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 I did notice that just before
Miyazawa's Shadow disappeared it said	 "They
cut ties with me."
3898038	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right... Somethin' about how with that
person gone he was free to start over...
3898039	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So... There really is someone behind
all this?
3898040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's put a pin in this conversation for
now. In the meantime I'll try to make sense
of the memories that came back to me.
3898041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should be reaching the exit any
moment now.
3898050	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? The heck is this?
3898051	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A movie ticket stub...? Why do I have this?
3898053	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The same thing happened with Kiuchi's.
Coming back to the real world makes the
Treasure return to its original form.
3898054	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What!? This scrap of paper is Miyazawa's
Treasure!?
3898055	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait... That's right. He said he looked up
to the movie stars he watched as a kid.
3898056	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. That dream became distorted in his mind	
and his Shadow went out of control. That led
him to act out in the real world.
3898057	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3898058	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 if someone really did manipulate
Miyazawa... Then they're the reason he ended
up that way	 right?
3898059	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Speculatively! But yes	 that is what I think.
3898060	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's possible that person could be watching
us this very minute.
3898061	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh!? Wait	 what!? You mean we're being
watched here in the real world?
3898062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a possibility. We have stolen twisted
desires from two people already.
3898063	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If this... mastermind truly is orchestrating
things behind the scenes	 it would be logical
to assume that we may be on their radar.
3898065	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right. Here we're just regular
high schoolers and an owl.
3898066	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If they're somebody powerful	 or part of
some big organization	 we won't stand a
chance against them.
3898067	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh god... What should we do?
3898069	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's right. I'm glad we can count on you
to keep a level head	 Leader.
3898070	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. Guess it's best to trust our
identities are safe and stick to business
as usual.
3898071	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we're obviously acting cautious	 it'll
look suspicious.
3898072	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh right! That makes sense...
3898073	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ooookaaaay! Time for a mood change! I'm
beat	 so I'mma head home and hit the hay!
3898074	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That was so unnatural...
3898075	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We just said to act normal...
3898076	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm? That was normal for me.
3898077	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And there's no homework today	 so I can take
a long bath and sleep like a rock!
3898078	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh crap I forgot... My class has math
homework for Katayama-san...
3898079	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oof. RIP...
3898080	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't know if I can get any of the answers
right	 but I guess I should try. I owe her
after all.
3898081	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll get goin' then. See ya guys!
3898082	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm headin' home too. {NAME2}	 Lufel	
see you at school!
3898083	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Back to everyday life just like that...
Talk of this mastermind didn't seem to deter
those two one bit.
3898084	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 shall we head home as well	 {NAME2}?
3898100	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo	 chats are quite the convenient
contrivance. People can relay thoughts to
each other without meeting in person.
3898101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But keeping in mind that our actions may be
being observed... We should maintain a degree
of caution in our virtual communications.
3898102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From now on we should consider planning out
our actions more carefully.
3898104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. We need an advisor. Someone to act as
a sort of brain	 managing the functions of
the Phantom Thieves...
3898105	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 we've been succeeding on improv and luck
up until now.
3898106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We need an advisor. Someone to act as a sort
of brain	 managing the functions of the
Phantom Thieves...
3898108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Motoha relies more on her intuition
than logic.
3898109	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We need someone who can deduce this
puppet master's way of thinking and
anticipate their next move.
3898110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shun seems sharp	 but he doesn't strike me
as a strategist.
3898111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	His deep compassion makes it hard to imagine
him pulling one over on this mastermind.
That takes Shun out of the running.
3898112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course I'm not an unreasonable
candidate...
3898113	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 sorting my returning memories	
studying the Metaverse... That is truthfully
where I want to focus my efforts.
3898115	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You are not a candidate for advisor either.
3898116	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've successfully recovered two Treasures
now. That's thanks to your contribution as
team leader.
3898117	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 I want you to continue focusing
on commanding the Phantom Thieves.
3898118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 that's my way of saying you're a
reliable leader. I have high hopes for your
efforts going forward.
3898122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 let's get to sleep.
3898140	Gossip-L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ving Man	Huh? Miyazawa retired?
3898141	K<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>owledgeable Man	Yeah	 it's all over the internet.
3898142	K<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>owledgeable Man	Apparently all his food reviews on TV and
online were total lies...
3898143	K<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>owledgeable Man	Also	 he tried to steal the rights to the
restaurants he shut down	 and made buttloads
of money ripping people off.
3898144	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ssip-Loving Man	Talk about a full-course crime... Oh yeah	
he was condemned as a Menace	 wasn't he?
3898145	Gossip-L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ving Man	It actually made him popular for a while.
But I guess pull back the curtain and he's
just a regular	 rotten Menace.
3898146	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Witnessing the fruits of our labor as a
team? Not a bad suggestion. I'll join you.
3898160	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I	 Hiromu Miyazawa	 for the cruel and
insensitive conduct I have perpetrated
against several restaurants...
3898161	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The terrible turmoil my actions have caused
them	 their families	 and friends...
3898162	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	And for the horrible crimes I've committed...
I sincerely apologize.
3898163	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I am so	 so very sorry!
3898164	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I know my apology can't possibly make up
for all I've done...
3898165	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	But starting today	 I will be retiring from
all media platforms.
3898166	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	To everyone I've hurt through my egoistic
behavior	 I am truly	 deeply sorry.
3898167	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Journalist	Miyazawa-san! Does this mean all of the bad
reviews from your internet and television
appearances were fabricated?
3898168	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Journalist	Is it true you extorted large sums of money
from restaurants in exchange for
retracting reviews!?
3898169	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Yes	 it's true.
3898170	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Journalist	Your reviews put several restaurants out of
business. How do you respond to this?
3898171	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I don't know how I can ever make it up to
them	 but I want to make everything right...
3898172	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Journalist	Why confess now? What caused this sudden
change of heart?
3898173	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	The cause...? It was...
3898174	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	Phantom... Thieves...
3898175	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	I mean... I feel like someone took the evil
out of my heart...
3898176	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Journalist	Did you just say "Phantom Thieves"?
3898177	Female Jo<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rnalist	Is this related to their calling card seen
in your announcement for the Victory Kitchen
chain?
3898178	Hiromu Miyaz<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wa	*sob* *weep*
3898179	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Journalist	Miyazawa-san! Please stop crying and answer
the question!
3898190	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I can't believe it... Miyazawa really
confessed to everything...
3898191	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	His heart's completely changed...
Incredible...
3898192	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We heard about Kiuchi's confession through
the news. But actually seeing it firsthand
is something else...
3898193	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3898194	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks again	 you guys. This means I can
bring Pops some good news.
3898196	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's right! We got this far cause we all
worked together! Thanks to you too	 Shun!
3898197	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I haven't felt this at peace in a while.
This is like I-finished-all-my-
homework-level peace...
3898198	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Dammit! I didn't finish the math homework
for Katayama-san!
3898199	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? I thought you said you did what
you could...
3898200	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sure	 I tried. Couldn't solve a single
problem though!
3898201	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait... Is Shun actually noodle-brained?
3898202	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're one to talk!
3898203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nuh-uh! I got an overall GPA of 1!
3898204	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's failing!
3898205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*sigh* Good grief... No telling how things
will turn out with this motley crew.
3898207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 you're right about that.
3898208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll still be counting on you to lead us
from now on	 {NAME2}.
3898209	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I didn't fail! I made it just over the mark!
3898210	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's nothin' to be proud of!
3902000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 you're all here.
3902001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So what is it? Why'd you make us come all
the way up here?
3902002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remember what I told you about the
mastermind?
3902003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Your theory that someone's manipulating
people's desires to bring about more Palaces?
3902004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. We can't risk that person
discovering our true identities.
3902005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 going forward I would like us to avoid
discussing our work in front of others
wherever possible.
3902006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah. I guess someone could overhear us in
class or the hallways.
3902007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But no one really comes up here	 so we
shouldn't have to worry. Plus it's nice and
roomy.
3902008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	On that note	 I have a proposition.
3902009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think we should use this roof as our
temporary hideout.
3902011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. We'll limit discussion of work-related
and other important matters to this location.
3902012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Besides	 don't you think a secret hideout
gives us more voguish charm as phantom
thieves?
3902013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There it is. Lufel's word of the day	
sponsored by ye olde dictionary.
3902014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Naturally! We can hardly call ourselves
phantom thieves without a hideout!
3902015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's the epitome of elegance. Can you imagine
anything else with such voguish charm?
3902016	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There it is. Lufel's word of the day	
sponsored by ye olde dictionary.
3902017	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You think voguish is a hard word?
3902018	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 anyway	 the roof hideout's a good idea.
I guarantee no one comes around here at
lunchtime.
3902019	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh that's right	 Shun's been eating his
cup ramen up here for a while now.
3902020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't come here much	 but it's so nice
eating out in the fresh air!
3902021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you two are fine with just cup ramen and
a piece of bread?
3902022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Want some of my lunch?
3902023	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No thanks. I don't wanna distract from the
flavor of the ramen.
3902024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME2}?
3902026	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay! Have some of my rolled omelet! Not to
toot my own horn	 but it's kinda
my specialty.
3902027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! Cooked it yourself then	 did you?
In that case	 I wouldn't mind helping myself
to some of that meat.
3902028	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 but I only have one sausage. Well	
I guess I can split it in half.
3902029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You shouldn't hold back among comrades	
<NAME2>. On that note	 I won't hesitate
to help myself to some of that meat.
3902030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 but I only have one sausage. How about
my rolled omelet? It's my specialty!
3902031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... A compromise	 is it? Very well.
I accept your terms.
3902032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	{NAME2}	 Motoha made all this food herself	
so I'll share some with you too.
3902035	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 Lufel	 are we here because you have
something to tell us?
3902036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. It's about our next target. Or rather	
it will be once we've found them...
3902037	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 the first thing we have to do is
figure out who the next Palace ruler is	
right?
3902038	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There're still five more scumbags like
Miyazawa out there.
3902039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Speaking of which	 we should be able to use
the Treasure we secured from him to
aid our search.
3902040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It should allow us entrance to a new area
of Mementos.
3902041	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And that's where our next target's Palace
will be? Good enough for me. Let's go
right after school today.
3902042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right. Call everyone together when you're
ready to head out	 Leader.
3902043	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 unrelated	 but did you guys hear we're
getting a new teacher soon?
3902044	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	New teacher? In the middle of the
school year?
3902045	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. Tomoko told me. Apparently he's not
a regular teacher.
3902046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not a regular teacher? What does that mean?
3902047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm not really sure	 but I don't think he's
going to be teaching classes.
3902048	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A teacher who doesn't teach? What's the
point of him coming here then?
3902050	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah! That makes sense. I bet that's
what it is!
3902051	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A class observer	 huh? I guess
it's possible...
3902052	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait	 is it though?
3902053	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 now you're talkin'! That would be great!
3902054	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're so transparent...
3902055	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 fifth period's starting. See you guys
after school!
3902100	AAAAAA==	Sorry to interrupt your lunch	 teachers.
I'm Yamanashi	 the academic coordinator.
3902101	AAAAAA==	This is Mr. Akashi.
3902102	AAAAAA==	He'll be working here starting today.
3902103	AAAAAA==	Hello	 my name is Kei Akashi. I look forward
to working with you all.
3902104	AAAAAA==	Mr. Akashi is an educational consultant
sent by the school board.
3902105	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Educational consultant?
3902106	AAAAAA==	Yes. It's probably an unfamiliar term	
so allow me to give a brief explanation.
3902107	AAAAAA==	As I'm sure you all know	 the overworking of
teachers has become a major issue in
recent years.
3902108	AAAAAA==	Between their classroom responsibilities	
administrative tasks	 and club advising	
they don't get enough time off.
3902109	AAAAAA==	Then there are problems on campus and
parental complaints. It all takes a heavy
mental toll.
3902110	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	You said it! Do you know how often I have
to take work home with me? I could
drop dead any minute!
3902111	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I gave up and accepted the fact that I'll
always be busy at this job	 but dealing with
parent calls is a serious pain.
3902112	AAAAAA==	I see you all have all have some problems
you're dealing with.
3902113	AAAAAA==	Many teachers are leaving the profession
these days	 and few are lining up to
replace them.
3902114	AAAAAA==	The school board sent me to help address
these problems at the source.
3902115	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Oh!
3902116	AAAAAA==	From today on	 I'll be working to identify
problems like unnecessary work and
eliminating them.
3902117	AAAAAA==	The goal is to create an environment where
instructors can focus on teaching
their students.
3902118	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	So you'll be instituting work reforms?
3902119	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	If I thought it'd actually make my life
easier	 I'd be all for it.
3902120	AAAAAA==	Mr. Akashi will be introduced to the
students tomorrow as a temporary
educational advisor.
3902121	AAAAAA==	Thank you very much. I'm looking forward
to hearing what the students have to say.
3902122	AAAAAA==	And please be aware that I may need to
visit your classrooms during your lessons.
3902123	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	If it means making less work for us	 then
you're more than welcome. Right	
Ms. Katayama?
3902124	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Yes. If it means being able to focus more of
our attention on the students...
3902125	AAAAAA==	I hope you're not thinking of making more
unauthorized home visits	 Ms. Katayama.
3902126	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Huh?
3902127	AAAAAA==	We received a complaint from a parent
yesterday saying their child's homeroom
teacher just showed up at their doorstep!
3902128	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	That student has excessive absences and
frequently leaves school early.
3902129	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I called the parents several times	 but they
didn't answer	 so I went to speak with them.
3902130	AAAAAA==	You went to their house for that!? Do you
not see how inappropriate that is!?
3902131	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Students need to be looked after at home
and at school.
3902132	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	If a parent consistently ignores calls from
their child's teacher	 it can be indicative
of problems at home.
3902133	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	If his homelife is the cause of his issues
at school	 then it's up to us teachers
to intervene!
3902134	AAAAAA==	All right	 all right. That's enough	 Ms...
3902135	AAAAAA==	Kumi Katayama	 is it?
3902136	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What is that?
3902137	AAAAAA==	Oh	 my apologies. These are smart glasses.
Basically a smartphone for your eyes.
3902138	AAAAAA==	I was just using them to check the roster
I was given.
3902139	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I... see...
3902140	AAAAAA==	You can't go to parent's homes	 Ms. Katayama.
It's against regulations.
3902141	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What!?
3902142	AAAAAA==	Especially impromptu visits. Putting pressure
on families can create more resistance
toward attending school.
3902143	AAAAAA==	If needed	 the school counselor and other
qualified professionals should deal with
the situation.
3902144	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I want to resolve things before they become
that dire. That's why I need to meet
with the parents!
3902145	AAAAAA==	*sigh* That's not how things are
done anymore.
3902146	AAAAAA==	Just having a teacher come to your house is
a big deal these days.
3902147	AAAAAA==	If you pay too much attention to one
student	 you'll end up neglecting the others	
won't you?
3902148	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Well	 you see...
3902149	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	But children need adults to look out for
them. If he doesn't feel safe at home...
3902150	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I can't just leave him to fend for himself!
3902151	AAAAAA==	All right already! We're going in circles
here. Mr. Akashi agrees with me!
3902152	AAAAAA==	From now on	 no unsolicited home visits!
Avoid meeting students outside of school	
period! Are we clear!?
3902153	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Wha‚Äî!?
3902154	AAAAAA==	That goes for the rest of you too. Now get
back to work	 everyone.
3902155	AAAAAA==	I'll be off now. I'm looking forward to
working with you	 Ms. Katayama.
3902200	AAAAAA==	Kumi Katayama... My intel was right. She'll
make for perfect fodder.
3902201	AAAAAA==	I should let them know. Hopefully everything
goes to plan.
3902250	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Everyone	 be quiet. I have an announcement
about tomorrow...
3902251	AAAAAA==	Club's got me so burnt out.
3902252	AAAAAA==	Hey	 wanna go to karaoke today?
3902253	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Settle down. I said I have something
to announce.
3902254	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I said pipe down	 didn't I!?
3902255	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Oh...
3902256	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	There will be a school-wide morning assembly
tomorrow	 so don't be late.
3902257	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Well	 that's it for today. Everyone	
get home safe and sound.
3902258	AAAAAA==	Yikes.
3902259	AAAAAA==	The hell was that?
3902260	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Seems like Ms. Katayama's in a bad mood.
3902262	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 I feel bad everyone was being so
noisy	 but it was kinda startling the way she
blew up like that.
3902263	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 yeah. Nobody listened to her.
3902264	AAAAAA==	Katayama's kinda scary	 huh? Maybe she's
got anger issues.
3902265	AAAAAA==	You don't wanna mess with a hot-head
teacher like that. What a Menace.
3902266	AAAAAA==	You're right! She's a total Menace!
3902267	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You wait till Katayama-san leaves the room
to start bad-mouthing behind her back?
3902274	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Tsk.
3902268	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Don't be so pathetic.
3902269	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What're we doin' today? Metaverse?
3902270	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 we just gonna blaze past your
spectacular entrance?
3902271	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That cowardly crap just pisses me off.
If you're gonna talk shit	 say it to the
person's face.
3902272	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 what do you think? I say if we can get
to the next area	 let's give it a go.
3902300	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that we have Miyazawa's Treasure	 we
should be able to enter the next area.
3902301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First we should head to the furthest edge of
the second area. Let's go	 Wonder.
3902350	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa! It opened!
3902351	AAAAAA==	A new area has been confirmed.
Updating guidance information.
3902352	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait. Did the Metaverse Navigator just talk?
3902353	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 yeah. Apparently it keeps track of when
we discover new places too.
3902354	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah... That's cool and all	 but isn't it
kinda creepy?
3902355	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The hell's with this app anyway? There's no
reception in the Metaverse	 but it works
just fine.
3902356	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh. True. I didn't really think about it
before	 but that's super weird.
3902357	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It just appeared on my phone one day and
kept coming back every time I deleted it.
3902358	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Do you know something about it	 Cattle?
3902359	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 I only know as much as you do. It could
be part of the memories I lost.
3902360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Only those with strong desires can use the
Metaverse Navigator. That's the extent of
my knowledge on the subject.
3902361	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So basically	 we know nothing.
3902362	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's kinda freaky that even Cattle doesn't
understand it.
3902363	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And look at this creepy icon! What is that	
a snake?
3902364	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. The looped snake motif reminds me
of an ouroboros.
3902365	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ouroboros?
3902366	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A snake biting its own tail to form a circle.
3902367	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It devours itself and is reborn in an
eternal loop. It symbolizes the cyclical
nature of the universe.
3902368	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But this snake isn't biting its tail.
3902369	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo? Ah	 I suppose you're right.
3902370	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So it's not an ouroboros	 but just a regular
snake monster?
3902372	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What kinda deeper meaning?
3902373	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You don't even know	 do you?
3902374	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't think that's it... Hang on a sec	
are we assuming a person made this?
3902375	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe we're just overthinking	 and it doesn't
really mean anything.
3902376	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Me neither. It probably doesn't mean
anything. No reason to overthink it.
3902377	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But that doesn't change the fact that this
app helped change Miyazawa's heart.
3902378	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 Kiuchi's too. Thanks for that	
Meta Nav.
3902379	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyway	 now we've gotta find the next Palace
ruler and change their heart ASAP!
3902380	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is correct. Let's start by listening to
the collective unconscious of this area.
3902381	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm?
3902382	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Did you find the Palace?
3902383	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not that. Something with a powerful
aura is coming this way!
3902384	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's an enemy! Be on your guard!
3902385	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh!? What is that!?
3902386	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This thing looks crazy strong!
3902388	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 I recognize this one too. But I was
sure we defeated it back then.
3902389	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't know what you're talkin' about	
but it's attacking!
3902430	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What was that? It seemed different from a
normal Shadow.
3902431	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder and I have fought that Shadow before.
3902432	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The day Wonder first entered Mementos	
we fought and defeated it.
3902433	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um... So a Shadow we thought was defeated
reappeared again?
3902434	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 and it was even stronger than before...
like the power of its desire had grown.
3902435	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What could this mean... Is this Shadow
being constantly reborn here without end?
3902436	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A Shadow of that strength	 robbing people of
their desires would mean...
3902437	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 it can't be. If that were the case	 the
world would have already fallen into chaos.
3902438	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't really get what all that means	 but
what kind of Shadow was it?
3902439	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sorry	 I'm not sure either. But it's
something we need to be wary of
going forward.
3902440	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 interruption aside	 we should continue
looking for signs of the Palace.
3902441	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm... No good. I can't hear anything about
the next Palace's ruler...
3902442	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Does that mean the next Palace ruler is
hiding their evil deeds like Miyazawa did?
3902443	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps. Or it could be a villain who's yet
to catch the public's attention.
3902444	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Such people are hard to find by listening to
the voices from their Palace alone. We need
more intel.
3902445	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How're we supposed to gather info in
the Metaverse?
3902447	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh right	 I guess we'll have to look for
problems going on in the real world and go
from there.
3902448	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh! Like how you guys investigated Miyazawa
before I became a phantom thief.
3902449	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 well	 I suggest we return to reality.
I'm sure we're all exhausted from the battle.
3902450	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course	 you may continue searching	 but
I'll leave that decision up to our leader.
3902500	AAAAAA==	Watch it	 moron! Ya coulda killed me!
3902501	AAAAAA==	Damn... What's that guy's problem!?
3902502	AAAAAA==	He was featured on Divine Justice.
He's a Menace.
3902503	AAAAAA==	I think he's called the "Hit-and-run Rider	
or something like that.
3902504,AAAAAA==,Hit-and-run Rider? Ugh, what a pain.
3902505,AAAAAA==,Agh, it's hard livin' in a world with so
many Menaces.
3902550,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,*chuckle* I am grateful for your presence
tonight. Now first, a word of praise.
3902551,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,The strength of your desire has outdone the
sinners of lust and vanity.
3902552,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,It may be presumptuous of me, but please
 accept this round of applause.
3902553,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,You, with desire powerful enough to guide
such a world away from ruin...
3902554,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,It seems you are using the power bestowed
upon you effectively.
3902556,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,My master refers to the power you use to
infiltrate other worlds.
3902557,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,Yes, the power granted to you... That of
the Metaverse Navigator.
3902558,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,It may become the key to averting the
coming catastrophe.
3902559,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,Or it may be the source that brings
destruction forth.
3902561,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,*chuckle* In other words...
3902562,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,You are not the only possessors of
this power.
3902564,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,Alas, we are merely observers of your
journey. Therefore, we cannot give you
the answers.
3902565,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,Ultimately, the outcome must be chosen by
you and you alone.
3902566,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,Surely the action you take to uncover the
truth will bring your desire to new heights.
3902567,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,That is all for this evening.
3902568,I<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>or,Sweet dreams... I look forward to our
next meeting.
3902570,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Oh, you...! You're Shun's friend!
3902571,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,I'm thinkin' a startin' up shop again.
Just takin' down the closed notice.
3902573,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Haha, thanks.
3902574,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Well, I can't say I'm back to a hundred
percent yet.
3902575,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,But lately, even when I lie down to rest,
all I can think about is my customers.
3902576,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,I just can't wait to see the smiles
on their faces when they eat my ramen.
3902577,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I can sense Yamagoshi overflowing with hope.
Of course this is a result of us changing
Miyazawa's heart...
3902578,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,But unlocking the new area of Mementos
may have also had an effect.
3902595,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,So, if I can't sleep peacefully, I've just
gotta open the shop back up, right?
3902579,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Well, all my part-timers quit, so I'll still
be out of operation for a while, but...
3902580,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Wait! You live around here, right?
Want a job?
3902582,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Oh, really?
Thanks, kid!
3902583,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Well, come by again when ya feel like
workin'.
3902584,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Sure. Ya don't gotta decide right away.
Just think about it if you're interested.
3902585,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Come by whenever ya feel like workin'
part-time.
3902586,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Ah boy, I'm gonna make ya late for school.
3902587,Y<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>magoshi,Looks like it might rain, so ya oughta
hurry. See ya when I see ya.
3902588,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It does look like rain...
Do you have an umbrella?
3902590,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hm, I see. We don't have time
to go back for one either, do we?
3902591,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I suppose we'll just have to head to school
and hope we arrive before the rain starts.
3902592,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,No umbrella for us then.
3902593,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I suppose we'll just have to head to school
and hope we arrive before the rain starts.
3902630,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh! Morning!
3902631,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Rain, huh...
3902632,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,It always rains the one time I don't bring
an umbrella.
3902633,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Riko-senpai!
3902634,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Get in.
3902635,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Him too, of course.
We're all going to the same place, aren't we?
3902636,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Sweet!
3902650,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Thank you, Riko-senpai.
You're a lifesaver!
3902651,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I just happened to be passing by.
3902653,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I usually take the train, but today I had to
finish working on some documents
before school.
3902654,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Documents? I guess that would be hard on the
train with the morning rush and all.
3902655,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Yes. But I think I can finish the rest
once we arrive.
3902656,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I've seen you at school, but this is
the first time we've really spoken.
3902657,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,You're in the same class as Motoha,
aren't you?
3902658,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ah, yes, that's right.
3902660,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,It's nice to meet you, {NAME1}-kun.
My name is Riko Tanemura.
3902661,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Uh, what!?
3902662,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ummm... His name is {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,
Riko-senpai.
3902663,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Hehe, how interesting. It's nice to meet you.
My name is Riko Tanemura.
3902664,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,We're about to arrive. Check to make sure
you don't forget anything in the car.
3902700,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Goodbye then.
3902701,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Thank you so much, Senpai!
3902702,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Lucky Riko-senpai picked us up!
3902703,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Quite. We expected to get drenched,
but had a comfortable little journey instead.
3902704,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,And the vehicle itself was no less spacious
nor less comfortable than my car form.
3902705,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hahaha, I think Senpai's car seats got yours
beat in the luxury department, Lufel.
3902706,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Excuse me!?
3902707,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Riko-senpai is super rich.
She's the daughter of Umetane's president.
3902708,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Umetane?
3902709,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah, the company that sells umeboshi and
pickled goods. Their ads are on TV all the
time. You guys haven't heard of it?
3902710,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,They sell tons of plum products like juice
and candy too.
3902711,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Senpai always gave us that juice to drink
after practice.
3902713,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah, little league practice.
3902714,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,The baseball field we used to practice on
belongs to Umetane.
3902715,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah. You know how I used to play
in little league?
3902716,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,The field we used to practice on
was Umetane's.
3902717,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Riko-senpai and I are close in age,
so she used to come cheer us on at games and
we became friends.
3902718,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,But it's been a long time since we've
really had a chance to talk.
3902719,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Since starting high school, she's been busy
with disciplinary committee duties.
3902720,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh? What's everyone gathering for?
3902721,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh crap! Isn't there a school-wide assembly
this morning?
3902722,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I remember your homeroom teacher saying
something to that effect yesterday.
3902723,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Crap! We're gonna stick out like sore thumbs
if we get to the gym late!
3902724,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,We don't have time to stop by the classroom!
Let's head straight to the gym!
3902750,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,The assembly's in the gym.
Come on, we gotta hurry!
3902770,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Next, please welcome the newest member
of our school's teaching staff, Mr. Akashi.
3902771,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,NB[Di][771]
3902772,AAAAAA==,Hello, everyone! My name is Kei Akashi.
I will be acting as an educational advisor
in a temporary capacity.
3902773,AAAAAA==,I know this title may be a little difficult
for you to understand...
3902774,AAAAAA==,But essentially, I am an educational
consultant brought here to improve
Kokatsu Academy.
3902775,AAAAAA==,Educational consultant?
3902776,AAAAAA==,The heck kinda job is that?
3902777,AAAAAA==,My job is to look for ways to improve
this school and work with the school board
to make those changes happen.
3902778,AAAAAA==,Your other teachers are so busy with their
own responsibilities that I was brought in
to work full-time on this effort.
3902779,AAAAAA==,So from tomorrow onward,
you may see me around the school,
observing classes and such...
3902780,AAAAAA==,But don't be alarmed. I promise it's all on
the up and up!
3902781,AAAAAA==,Then again, I suppose putting it that way
makes me seem more suspicious! Ahahaha!
3902782,M<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>llow Girl,Hehe, what a weirdo.
3902783,AAAAAA==,He seems easy to talk to.
Plus he's kinda hot.
3902784,AAAAAA==,Make the vending machines free, Sensei!
3902785,AAAAAA==,Great idea! That being said, I'll have to
negotiate with the school board first.
3902786,AAAAAA==,But I'm open to all of your opinions!
Please feel free to get in touch with me!
3902787,M<#000000,e,#FFFFFF>llow Girl,Pfff, yeah sure. Like anything will actually
change anyway.
3902788,AAAAAA==,Whoa, for real?
Let's go talk to him during lunch.
3902789,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I guess Mr. Akashi must be the teacher
Tomoko was talking about.
3902790,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I don't really get what an 
consultant does, but he seems
like an interesting guy.
3902791,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Well, if it stirs up hope in the students,
then all the better.
3902792,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Thank you very much, Mr. Akashi.
That concludes the morning assembly.
3902850,AAAAAA==,Mr. Akashi,
let me introduce you to the disciplinary committee chair,
Riko Tanemura-kun.
3902851,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Akashi.
3902852,AAAAAA==,Tanemura...
Ah yes, heiress to the Umetane company.
3902853,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Those are different from the glasses
you were wearing before.
Are those smart glasses?
3902854,AAAAAA==,Ah, yes.
3902855,AAAAAA==,My apologies.
I uploaded all of the students' information into these
in preparation for the job.
3902856,AAAAAA==,You are chair of the disciplinary committee,
daughter of a CEO, have excellent grades,
and are very popular among your peers.
3902857,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I'm nothing special...
3902858,AAAAAA==,Wow. That's Mr. Akashi for you.
His prep work is second to none!
3902859,AAAAAA==,I agree that Tanemura-kun is quite the
talent. She'll surely be a great help to you.
3902860,AAAAAA==,Feel free to get her to give you directions
around the school or prepare any materials
you may need!
3902861,AAAAAA==,Sir... Isn't it a violation of compliance
to order students around?
3902862,AAAAAA==,Oh! Um... You didn't hear that... Hahaha.
3902863,AAAAAA==,As for the private room you requested,
please use the Student Guidance Office.
3902864,AAAAAA==,Thank you very much.
I know you've also prepared me a desk in
the Faculty Room, but...
3902865,AAAAAA==,Some of the documents I'll be working with
aren't meant to be seen by other teachers,
so that will be a big help.
3902866,AAAAAA==,Of course. Please use the space freely!
Tanemura-kun, the documents?
3902867,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Yes, ma'am.
3902868,AAAAAA==,Mr. Akashi, these are the materials
you requested in advance. Please have a look.
3902869,AAAAAA==,Oho!
3902870,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I've also prepared them in digital form,
so I'll send the files to your computer.
3902871,AAAAAA==,Thank you very much! I'll be sure to use
that data to get the specifics I need.
3902872,AAAAAA==,But wow, it must have been quite the task
to prepare all of this.
3902873,AAAAAA==,Hahaha, I told you, didn't I?
Tanemura-kun does outstanding work!
3902874,AAAAAA==,But, sir...
3902875,AAAAAA==,I know I'm the one who requested the
documents, but this workload hardly seems
reasonable for a single student.
3902876,AAAAAA==,Having students handle such sensitive
documents is also an issue.
3902877,AAAAAA==,Ah‚Äî Uh‚Äî Haha...
Well, she excels at keeping secrets too!
3902878,AAAAAA==,Unlike the other students, she understands
what needs to be done and acts accordingly.
3902879,AAAAAA==,Is that right? You really shouldn't push her
too hard, you know.
3902880,AAAAAA==,Wouldn't dream of it! But she will have to
inherit her family's business someday...
3902881,AAAAAA==,...and this kind of clerical work
will prepare her for that.
Isn't that right, Tanemura-kun!?
3902882,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Yes. My father has encouraged me to help
the teachers with whatever they need.
3902883,AAAAAA==,I see...
Outstanding indeed...
3902884,AAAAAA==,In that case, I may ask for your help
after school on occasion, so I look forward
to working with you, Tanemura-san.
3902885,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Of course, Mr. Akashi.
3902950,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,That's all the announcements for today.
Oh, one more thing.
3902951,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Regarding Mr. Akashi from the assembly
this morning...
3902952,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,I know he mentioned he'll be around campus
starting tomorrow, and encouraged you all
to come speak with him, but...
3902953,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Well... Just be careful not to be rude
to him, okay? That's all.
3902954,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Does it seem like Ms. Katayama
is acting strange?
3902955,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Well, it certainly sounds like she has a bit
of disdain for this Akashi fellow.
3902956,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,But he only just got here.
You think something happened between them?
3902957,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,And hang on, I still don't get
what a consultant even does.
3902959,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I'd hate to have more tests.
But I'd definitely welcome less!
3902960,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,He did say something about making learning
easier at the assembly.
3902961,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh, and some boys asked for
free vending machines too.
3902962,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh yeah, I heard those boys at the assembly
asking for free vending machines.
3902963,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh, you don't? He said this morning that
he's open to requests from students...
3902964,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Maybe we can ask for a fancier cafeteria menu?
3902965,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh! And they should sell more baked goods!
I'd looove some sweet pastries!
3902966,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,There's nothing wrong with having desires,
but an overactive appetite is another issue.
3903000,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey! Headin' to lunch?
3903001,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I found some interesting cup noodles
at the convenience store this mornin'.
Wanna go to the hideout and try 'em?
3903003,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,They're really goin' all out on the flavors,
don't ya think? Gotta try everythin'
at least once, right!?
3903005,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,All right! Let's grab some drinks and head
to the roof.
3903006,AAAAAA==,Hey guys!
We're here with a taste testing video!
3903007,AAAAAA==,We're gonna buy every drink our school
vending machine sells and try all of them! Yaaay!
3903008,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What the hell?
They're blocking the vending machine.
3903009,AAAAAA==,Those two have been recording themselves
over there for a while now.
3903010,AAAAAA==,Can't they tell they're in the way?
Somebody should get a teacher.
3903011,AAAAAA==,Hey, don't you think this idea's
kind of boring considering the cost?
3903012,AAAAAA==,Ugh, don't say that after we've started
recording. What's your idea then?
3903013,AAAAAA==,I got it. Let's do what that Menace on
Divine Justice yesterday did.
3903014,AAAAAA==,You wanna imitate a Menace?
Hahaha, that's wild! Are you a Menace too!?
3903015,AAAAAA==,I'll use this spray and a lighter
to make a flamethrower!
3903016,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,They're outta their minds!
I gotta stop them!
3903017,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,What do you think you're doing!?
3903018,AAAAAA==,Ow!
3903019,AAAAAA==,What's wrong with you!?
That frickin' hurt!
3903020,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,You took the words right out of my mouth.
Do you have any idea how much danger you
almost put yourselves in just now?
3903021,AAAAAA==,Excuse me? We were just shooting a video.
3903022,AAAAAA==,And I got you on camera hitting a student!
3903023,AAAAAA==,Let's post about this violent teacher
on Divine Justice! I bet it'll go viral!
3903024,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, that's enough! Katayama-san
was just trying to stop you dumbasses
from setting yourselves on fire!
3903025,AAAAAA==,Owww! What're you doing!?
Who even are you?
3903026,AAAAAA==,A violent boy?
How dare you lay hands on a girl!?
3903027,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What? Hey! Turn that camera off!
3903028,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Kano-kun, calm down.
Let go of her hand.
3903029,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, sorry...
3903030,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Stop recording at once, you two.
3903031,AAAAAA==,Ah, hey! What the hell!? Give that back!
3903032,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Hand over your phone too.
3903033,AAAAAA==,Hah? Are you covering this up
because we caught you on camera?
You really are a Menace!
3903034,AAAAAA==,Violent teacher! Violent teacher over here!
3903035,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,That's enough alre‚Äî!
3903036,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Quiet, girls!
3903037,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I heard some students were causing trouble.
3903038,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,What exactly is going on here?
3903039,AAAAAA==,Ms. Katayama assaulted me!
3903040,AAAAAA==,I got it all on video!
3903041,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That's not what happened! You two started it
when you whipped out a lighter!
3903042,AAAAAA==,Eep! Don't yell at me!
3903043,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Please, just tell me what happened.
3903044,AAAAAA==,A dispute between a teacher and student?
As a consultant, I'd like to hear
what's going on.
3903045,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Mr. Akashi...
3903046,AAAAAA==,I will speak to Ms. Katayama.
You speak to the students, Tanemura-san.
3903047,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Hold on. These students were engaged in
incredibly dangerous behavior.
3903048,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,We can't just leave them be. If you're going
to pull me aside, at least call for another
teacher to deal with them.
3903049,AAAAAA==,No, the disciplinary committee chair
can handle it. Students should take care
of other students.
3903050,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Don't be ridiculous!
It's the teacher's job to guide the students!
3903051,AAAAAA==,I'm not being ridiculous. It's my job to
uproot old ways of thinking like that.
3903052,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Don't worry, Ms. Katayama. I'll be here to
listen to what the students have to say.
3903053,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,It's one of my jobs as chair of the
disciplinary committee.
3903054,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Tanemura-san...
3903055,AAAAAA==,Return this to them.
Confiscating personal effects is a big problem
in today's climate.
3903056,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,They were recording other students! I can't
return it until the videos are deleted!
3903057,AAAAAA==,What!? No way you're deleting our videos!
Screw that!
3903058,AAAAAA==,If a teacher were to delete a video, there
would be allegations of a cover-up.
3903059,AAAAAA==,How about I, as a third party, check it?
If there truly is a problem,
then I'll delete it.
3903060,AAAAAA==,Huh!? How could you, Mr. Akashi!?
3903061,AAAAAA==,I'll only watch the one video.
Also, I don't recommend using controversy
to go viral in this day and age.
3903062,AAAAAA==,When I have more time,
I'll teach you how to make better videos.
3903063,AAAAAA==,Seriously? You know how to make videos?
3903064,AAAAAA==,Yes. I'm a consultant. I know exactly what
kinds of videos will boost your numbers.
3903065,AAAAAA==,Whoa, Mr. Akashi's so chill!
3903066,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Is that all then? You two, please follow me
to the Student Guidance Office.
3903067,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Does that mean that I'm gonna have to talk
to Ms. Disciplinary Committee too?
3903068,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Alright. I'll talk to Tanemura-san for you.
Eat your lunch before the break ends.
3903069,AAAAAA==,Okay, Ms. Katayama. With me, please.
3903070,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,All right...
3903071,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Ms. Katayama! It wasn't your fault...
We saw everything!
3903100,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, you don't think Katayama-san's
in the wrong, do you?
3903102,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Right? Someone could've been seriously
burned if she hadn't gotten involved.
3903103,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,And if she hadn't smacked the lighter
outta that girl's hand, you better believe
I woulda.
3903104,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That's true... Maybe she coulda handled it
better than she did...
3903105,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But somebody could've been seriously burned
if she hadn't gotten involved.
3903106,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,And if she hadn't smacked the lighter
outta that girl's hand, you better believe
I woulda.
3903107,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I understand your point, but it would have
been an even bigger problem if you had
attacked another student.
3903108,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It wouldn't have come to that...!
3903109,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I guess Katayama-san saved my ass
once again.
3903150,AAAAAA==,That's definitely Katayama, right?
3903151,AAAAAA==,I heard she hit some girl yesterday.
3903152,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,{NAME2}, look at this!
3903154,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ms. Katayama was posted as a Menace!
3903155,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Look at this video!
3903156,AAAAAA==,What do you think you're doing!?
3903157,AAAAAA==,Ow!
3903158,AAAAAA==,Stop recording at once, you two.
3903159,AAAAAA==,Hand over your phone too.
3903160,AAAAAA==,Hah? Are you covering this up
because we caught you on camera?
You really are a Menace!
3903161,AAAAAA==,Violent teacher! Violent teacher over here!
3903162,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Is this from yesterday's lunch break?
It looks quite heavily edited.
3903163,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,They blurred her face and wrote her name
as Ms. K.
3903164,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,But any of the students here would
immediately know that it's Ms. Katayama.
3903165,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Who would've posted something like this?
3903200,AAAAAA==,What is the meaning of this!?
3903201,AAAAAA==,A teacher, of all people, labeled a Menace!?
This is an unprecedented scandal!
3903202,AAAAAA==,And you, Mr. Akashi! I thought you had
the students delete the videos!
3903203,AAAAAA==,Yes, of course I did.
However...
3903204,AAAAAA==,Other students may have been recording too.
It did cause quite a stir.
3903205,AAAAAA==,Agh! I've had it up to here!
3903206,AAAAAA==,Listen up, Ms. Katayama!
No contact with students outside of class
from now on!
3903207,AAAAAA==,Don't touch them! Don't talk to them! Don't
take their things! Are we clear!?
3903208,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Unbelievable... So you want me to just turn
a blind eye to dangerous behavior?
3903209,AAAAAA==,Call for Mr. Akashi or another teacher
if that happens! Or get Tanemura-kun to help!
3903210,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Tanemura-san!? Disciplinary committee aside,
she's just a student!
3903211,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Are you suggesting teachers should rely
on students to do their jobs for them?
3903212,AAAAAA==,That student is more reliable than you are!
3903213,AAAAAA==,In fact, the female students Tanemura-san
 reprimanded both turned in formal letters
of apology.
3903214,AAAAAA==,A far cry from the boy you sent back to class
without a word of warning.
3903215,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Ngh...
3903216,AAAAAA==,*sigh* At any rate,
I want you to go home for the day.
3903217,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,What? But I have to teach my classes
and conduct homeroom.
I can't just abandon my duties.
3903218,AAAAAA==,Your classes will be study hall periods.
And another teacher can sub in
for your homeroom.
3903219,AAAAAA==,You wouldn't be able to conduct classes
anyway. You'd just get bombarded
with questions.
3903220,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Okay... I understand.
Sorry to have caused such trouble.
3903221,AAAAAA==,Trouble? Try total nuisance!
3903222,AAAAAA==,This goes for the rest of you too!
Don't interfere with students unnecessarily!
3903223,AAAAAA==,If something happens, turn to Mr. Akashi or
Tanemura-kun! Are we clear!?
3903250,AAAAAA==,Huh? What's Mr. Hakozaki doing here?
3903251,AAAAAA==,Where's Ms. Katayama?
3903252,Mr. Ha<#000000,k,#FFFFFF>ozaki,Oh! Sorry to surprise everyone!
Ms. Katayama is um... Ummm...
3903253,Mr. Ha<#000000,k,#FFFFFF>ozaki,Sick!
She wasn't feeling good and went home early!
Anyway, I'll be filling in for her today!
3903254,AAAAAA==,Sick, huh? Yeah right!
3903255,AAAAAA==,Did she get fired since she was on
Divine Justice?
3903256,Mr. Ha<#000000,k,#FFFFFF>ozaki,She hasn't been f-f-fired!
She was just sent home is all...
3903257,AAAAAA==,Ahaha, Hakozaki-chan spilled the tea.
3903258,Mr. Ha<#000000,k,#FFFFFF>ozaki,Gah! Um! It's time for announcements!
I'm just gonna make them, and then we're done
here, okay?
3903275,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I hope Ms. Katayama's okay.
Do you think the other teachers are giving
her trouble over what happened?
3903260,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I still can't believe she was called out
on Divine Justice.
3903261,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Whatever the circumstances, the fact
that video was posted to Divine Justice
means...
3903262,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,...your homeroom teacher
has been declared a Menace.
3903263,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,No, no, no! She can't be declared a Menace
from just one post!
3903264,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Sure people are talking about it, but she
hasn't been officially condemned by
Magatsukami or anything...
3903265,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,But those reported on by Divine Justice
are known as Menaces to the public.
3903266,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It was the same with Kiuchi and Miyazawa...
Hasn't it always been that way?
3903267,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hey!
Don't you dare lump her in with those two!
3903268,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Of course there's a good chance this will
get lost in the sea of other posts.
3903269,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,However, if she continues to be known
as a Menace, the possibility of her
becoming a Palace ruler...
3903271,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What? You agree with him, {NAME2}?
3903272,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,R-Right!? That would never happen!
3903273,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,As I said before, it's only a possibility.
3903274,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I know you could be right,
but I really don't wanna believe it.
3903300,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,My head is killing me... I'm so pissed...
3903301,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Why am I being called a Menace!?
3903302,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Agh... Damn it all!
Why is this happening to me!?
3903303,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,I'm so pissed off!
3903304,AAAAAA==,Heheh...
3903350,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hey, {NAME2}!
3903351,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Are you here buying lunch too?
3903352,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh! Why don't we eat lunch together today?
We could go to the rooftop and...
3903353,AAAAAA==,Hey guys! Welcome to another taste testing
video!
3903354,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Uh, what's going on?
3903355,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Huh...?
3903356,AAAAAA==,We're gonna buy every kind of bread in the
store and review them all!
3903357,AAAAAA==,Oh god, it's them again... They're the two
that had that fight with Ms. Katayama.
3903358,AAAAAA==,Hey! Get outta the way! Nobody else can
buy a damn thing!
3903359,AAAAAA==,Oh nooo, you're scaring me! Please stop
yelling, okaaay?
3903360,AAAAAA==,Or I'll take a video of this and throw you
under the bus too! Gahaha!
3903361,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What's wrong with those two!? I'm gonna
give them a piece of my mind!
3903362,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Don't, Motoha! Those two are why
Ms. Katayama's getting the Menace treatment!
3903363,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Seriously? All the more reason to call
them out!
3903364,AAAAAA==,Someone get Tanemura-senpai. Something has
to be done about them.
3903365,AAAAAA==,Someone's already on it!
3903367,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,You haven't heard? Recently, everyone asks
for Riko-senpai when there's a dispute.
3903368,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Because the teachers are unreliable...
3903369,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh? What do you mean?
3903370,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Even when students are acting out, the
teachers won't reprimand them.
3903371,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,If someone points a phone at them and says
they're recording, the teachers run off.
3903372,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,So what, they're having Tanemura-senpai do
their jobs for them? That's ridiculous!
3903373,AAAAAA==,Over here, Tanemura-senpai! Over here!
3903374,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,You two again... Was that written apology
you submitted nothing but lies?
3903375,AAAAAA==,We didn't do anything. We're just here to
buy lunch.
3903376,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,You're inconveniencing the other students.
Come over here for a moment.
3903377,AAAAAA==,Huh? Can't it wait until after we're
done recording?
3903378,AAAAAA==,You two shouldn't cause Tanemura-san any
more trouble.
3903379,AAAAAA==,Oh, hey, Mr. Akashi. Are you here to buy
lunch too?
3903380,AAAAAA==,I came here to stop you. I warned you about
sharing inflammatory videos, didn't I?
3903381,AAAAAA==,What's so inflammatory about food reviews?
3903382,AAAAAA==,All right, all right. I suppose I'll just
have to give you another lecture on
viral videos, then.
3903383,AAAAAA==,For real? I guess we'll be having lunch with
you in the Student Guidance Office,
Mr. Akashi!
3903384,AAAAAA==,I'll deal with these two, so please take
a break.
3903385,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Sorry to burden you.
3903386,AAAAAA==,It's not a burden at all. It's my job to
make school life better for all of
the students.
3903387,AAAAAA==,Let's go, you two.
3903388,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Wow, Mr. Akashi handled that really well.
Guess he's pretty reliable, huh?
3903389,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Are you all right, Riko-senpai?
3903390,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Oh, Motoha, Tomoko. And {NAME1}-kun too.
3903391,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Did they interrupt your shopping as well?
I'm sorry for the trouble.
3903392,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Don't worry about us.
3903393,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,But, Riko-senpai, is it true that you're
being called in to settle arguments?
3903394,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Well... It's true that the committee has been
called upon a lot more lately.
3903395,AAAAAA==,There you are, Tanemura-kun!
3903396,AAAAAA==,Was there another problem with students?
I heard that Mr. Akashi took care of it
for you.
3903397,AAAAAA==,I appreciate you following up as well.
However...
3903398,AAAAAA==,If you could avoid burdening him with your
responsibilities, we in the faculty would
probably have a higher opinion of you.
3903399,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Excuse me!?
3903400,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Instead of Riko-senpai, shouldn't the faculty
be dealing with these problems in the
first place?
3903401,AAAAAA==,Oh... Uh, about that...
3903402,AAAAAA==,It's a work reform from Mr. Akashi. The idea
is that students should manage
other students.
3903403,AAAAAA==,It fosters student autonomy and frees up
instructors to focus on teaching.
3903404,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,The heck!? Sounds more like an excuse to
avoid responsibility!
3903405,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Stop, Motoha.
3903406,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Mr. Yamanashi, was there something you
needed my help with?
3903407,AAAAAA==,Oh, yes, yes there is. I'd like you to
digitize some more materials for me.
3903408,AAAAAA==,I forwarded you the email from Mr. Akashi.
The details are in there.
3903409,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What the‚Äî!? Did I seriously just see that
man pawn off his work onto you!?
3903411,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,It's fine. If I just keep my head down and
do my job, Mr. Yamanashi will have a higher
opinion of me.
3903412,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Wha...
3903413,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,He's simple and easy to deal with. He'll do
anything to make life easier for himself.
3903414,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,If you make someone like him think you're a
useful pawn, he won't turn on you.
3903415,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Turn on you...?
3903416,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,In that respect, maybe we can trust
Mr. Akashi too. Even though he's shadier than
those glasses and just as hard to read.
3903417,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,He's not the type to abandon someone unless
they're getting in his way.
3903418,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What are you talking about, Riko-senpai?
Abandonment, betrayal...
3903419,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,No one would do something like that to you!
3903420,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I wonder...
3903421,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Don't you feel uneasy when relationships are
based solely on feelings or friendship?
3903422,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Personally, I don't trust people who try to
get close to me without knowing what they
stand to gain from it.
3903423,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Really? But...
3903424,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I like you, Senpai! Even if there's nothing
in it for me!
3903425,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Yeah! I like you too, Riko-senpai!
3903426,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I know! I can help with the work
Mr. Yamanashi gave you!
3903427,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,And just because I want to help you! I don't
want anything in return!
3903428,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Motoha, Tomoko... You two never change, huh?
3903429,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Thank you, but I don't need any help. I can
manage on my own.
3903430,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,You came to buy lunch, didn't you? Hurry up
before they run out.
3903431,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Riko-senpai...
3903432,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Does she seem different? She never used to
say stuff like that before.
3903433,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah... What happened to her?
3903470,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What are we doing today? Going to
the Metaverse?
3903471,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,We still haven't found the next Palace.
3903555,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,With Miyazawa, you said you found him by
listening for his full name, right?
3903472,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes. It's easier to find Palace rulers
through the collective unconscious if I know
their full names.
3903473,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,But there aren't many people causing an
uproar in the real world on the same level
as Kiuchi and Miyazawa.
3903474,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We should consider changing our
approach, then.
3903475,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Think of what Kiuchi and Miyazawa had in
common. They were both Menaces.
3903476,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,And they were officially condemned by
Magatsukami. Kiuchi as the Subway Slammer, and
Miyazawa a corrupt food critic.
3903477,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, I guess since Palaces pop up around
bad guys, assuming the next ruler could be
another Menace isn't much of a reach.
3903478,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Does that mean one of the Menaces trending
on Divine Justice right now could be our guy?
3903479,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hmmm... A reckless cyclist known as the
Hit-and-run Rider. No one knows their
name or face.
3903480,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,And then there's Ms. K, the violent teacher
of K Academy...
3903481,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Let's skip that one! Who else...
3903482,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,No, we can't take her off the suspect list
yet. Katayama is a Menace.
3903483,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hah!?
3903484,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What're you talkin' about, Lufel!?
Katayama-san's only up there because of
those selfish dumbasses!
3903485,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,That may be the case, but I'm simply stating
the facts of the matter.
3903486,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Katayama appeared on Divine Judgment and
became known to the public as a Menace.
3903487,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Fine, maybe that happened, but still...!
3903488,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,You mentioned that the other day, too,
Lufel.
3903489,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, I guess she is being treated like
a Menace.
3903490,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But that doesn't mean she has a Palace,
right? She's not like those other two!
3903491,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Ah! Wait, Shun. Someone's coming.
3903492,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ms. Katayama!?
3903493,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Kano-kun, can I speak with you?
You two as well.
3903494,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,It's about this video.
3903495,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Miyazawa's Food Fight announcement?
3903496,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What!? I thought he deleted the channel.
All his videos should be gone.
3903497,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,He was a famous streamer, so it got reposted
all over the place.
3903498,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,I talked about it with {NAME1}-kun and Arai-san
before, but I didn't check with you
yet, Kano-kun.
3903499,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,The boy named as the opponent... His face
is hidden, but it's you, isn't it, Kano-kun?
3903500,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Uh, no! That's um‚Äî That's not...!
3903501,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,That day, all three of you skipped afternoon
classes and came back to school together.
3903502,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,You paid Hiromu Miyazawa a visit, didn't you?
3903504,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The hell‚Äî!? {NAME2}! Shhh!
3903505,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Thank you for answering honestly.
3903506,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Burgers? Likely story.
3903507,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Don't worry, you're not in trouble. And I
won't tell the other teachers.
3903508,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Miyazawa's retirement caused a real stir
since he was a fairly powerful celebrity up
till then.
3903509,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,And if you were involved in a dispute with
someone like that, well, I wish you would
have come to me for help.
3903510,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Ah...
3903511,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Because as an adult... Or really, as your
teacher, I want to help you all in
any way I can.
3903512,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ms. Katayama...
3903513,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,You three are together a lot lately. If
that's just because you're friends and all,
that's great, but...
3903514,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,I'm worried that you might still have some
problem you're dealing with.
3903515,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,How did you‚Äî
3903516,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Hm?
3903517,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Ah, uh, nope! We're uhhh, all good!
Right as rain!
3903518,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,You're a terrible liar, Kano-kun. Hehe.
Your face says it all.
3903519,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,If you're in trouble, I want you to talk to
me. Don't do anything dangerous on your own.
3903520,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm sorry! This is something we just...
can't tell you!
3903521,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's not that there isn't a problem, but...
I just don't wanna get you involved...
3903522,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Why not?
3903523,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I can't tell you that either.
3903524,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But... We're totally fine! We'll get through
this one way or another!
3903526,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Yeah, there's no need for you to worry
yourself sick over us!
3903527,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Am I really that unreliable...?
3903528,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hm...
3903529,AAAAAA==,Ms. Katayamaaa?
3903530,AAAAAA==,This is no good. The academic coordinator
already told you, fraternizing with students
outside of class is prohibited.
3903531,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What do you mean prohibited?
3903532,AAAAAA==,Right now you're persona non grata. We can't
have you making the students uneasy.
3903533,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What!?
3903534,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,It's okay, Kano-kun.
3903535,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Please forgive me. I'll return to the
faculty office at once.
3903536,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,When the three of you are really
struggling...
3903537,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,Please ask an adult for help. Even if it's
someone other than me.
3903538,Kumi Katay<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>ma,That's all I wanted to say. Anyway...
Excuse me.
3903539,AAAAAA==,That must have been quite trying for you all.
3903540,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ms. Katayama was worried about us and
came to give us some advice.
3903541,AAAAAA==,Oh? If you need advice, maybe I can help.
I am an educational consultant after all.
3903542,AAAAAA==,{NAME1}-kun and Arai-san from 2C, and
Kano-kun from 2D.
3903543,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,How do you know our names?
3903544,AAAAAA==,Neat, isn't it? These smart glasses allow me
to match faces against the student register.
3903545,AAAAAA==,Anyways, I'm always open to listening to
problems or taking suggestions for school
improvements.
3903546,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I thought he was a good teacher at first,
but Mr. Akashi's kinda creepy, huh?
3903547,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Can't say I've ever been a fan.
3903548,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Thank goodness. We can finally resume our
strategic meeting. So, as I was saying...
3903549,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I think I'd like to try searching for a
Palace with the name Kumi Katayama.
3903550,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What!? Would you drop it already!?
3903551,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,No need for such ire. We could end up proving
that she has no Palace.
3903552,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We'll simply try each name we can think of
and eliminate suspects one by one. That's our
only option at the moment.
3903553,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Tch. Seems like a waste of time to me. But
if it'll lift your suspicion, then whatever
floats your boat, Lufel.
3903554,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Then it's settled. Let's go to the Metaverse
as soon as we can, Leader.
3903600,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Kumi... Katayama...
3903601,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I still don't think you're gonna
find anything.
3903602,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,That's exactly why we came here to
make sure, Soy.
3903603,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sure, but still...
3903604,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,...Found it.
3903605,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Huh...? 
3903606,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I've detected a Palace with the name
Kumi Katayama. There's no doubt about it.
3903607,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,No way! You're wrong!
3903608,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Is Ms. Katayama really a Palace ruler?
3903609,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,No freakin' way! Are you sure it's not
someone else, Cattle!?
3903610,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,No, the name Kumi Katayama is definitely
causing voices in Mementos to react.
3903611,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,But there's something strange about them.
It's like there's noise making the voices
jumbled up.
3903612,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Miyazawa's Palace was nothing like this.
3903613,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Are you kidding me? How could this happen...?
3903615,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah... Now that we found the place, we have
to check it out.
3903616,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sorry, Cattle, but I won't believe this till
I see it with my own two eyes.
3903617,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Let's go, Wonder!
3903640,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We need to pinpoint the location of the next
Palace before I lose the trail.
3903650,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Whoa, is this...?
3903651,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes. Just like with Kiuchi and Miyazawa,
this Palace exists outside of Mementos.
3903652,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Is this Palace really Ms. Katayama's?
3903653,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We won't know without a proper investigation.
Let's go, Wonder.
3903700,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,So this is... Katayama-san's Palace?
3903701,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What kind of facility is this? Pretty sure
it's not a school.
3903702,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It looks like there's some kind of large
structure in the distance.
3903703,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,But that barricade is blocking our path.
3903704,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's find another way in, Wonder.
3903730,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoo... Do you hear water?
3903731,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Yeah, I do... It's like the sound of a river
or a waterfall, right?
3903732,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What the hell is this place?
3903733,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems we can still go further into the
building. Let's have a look.
3903760,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Whoa!
3903761,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh damn! It's a dam!
3903763,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,But why a dam? Is this a memorable place for
her or something?
3903764,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We may learn why in the course of
investigation.
3903765,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Perhaps we can enter from over there?
Let's go, Wonder.
3903800,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hmm?
3903801,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,This door won't open.
3903802,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Maybe it's locked?
3903803,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh hey, look at that!
3903804,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Is this a keypad lock?
3903805,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,So it won't open without the right
passcode...
3903806,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,God damn it. Okay, what should we try?
3903807,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,A number, huh? I didn't see anything on the
way in that seemed like a clue.
3903808,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But this door looks like the only way ahead.
3903809,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Well it's Ms. Katayama's Palace, so the
numbers should have something to do
with her, right?
3903810,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Soy, do you happen to know her birthday?
3903811,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Nah, how would I know that?
3903813,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Ugh! What're you talkin' about!?
Katayama-san's just... She looks out
for me is all!
3903814,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Then why are you blushing?
3903815,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Shut it! Wait, you can't even see my face
through this mask!
3903816,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Come now. Enough nonsense. This is
enemy territory.
3903817,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Good point... So, Soy, can you think of a
number that might fit the bill?
3903818,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hmmm, maybe it's some kind of mnemonic?
3903820,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Oh, that's brilliant! But I doubt it's a
two-digit passcode.
3903821,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Maybe we gotta replace the letters of her
name with numbers and add them to get... 54?
3903822,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,K, U, M, I, 11 + 21 + 13 + 9... That makes
54, but I doubt it's a two-digit passcode.
3903823,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Maybe it's 23 because she's the homeroom
teacher of 2C?
3903824,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Well, if we combine them...
3903826,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Well, that didn't work...
3903827,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,In that case, should we just try everythin'
starting from 0000?
3903828,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Well, we don't actually know if it's a
four-digit number either.
3903829,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh? What was that!?
3903830,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Wha‚Äî!? An enemy!? Damn! I can't believe
I didn't notice it approaching!
3903831,AAAAAA==,Who might you be? This area is limited to
authorized personnel only.
3903832,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Who's this chump? Don't tell me he's the
Palace ruler?
3903833,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,No, his aura is too weak. No wonder I
couldn't sense him.
3903834,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,In fact, his presence is even weaker than
that of the wandering Shadows in Mementos.
3903835,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Then he's weaker than a normal Shadow?
Geez, I panicked over nothing.
3903836,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,In that case, let's roast this small fry and
keep movin'.
3903837,AAAAAA==,Small fry!? Excuse you!
3903838,AAAAAA==,Verbal abuse against someone you've just
met is a violation of compliance.
3903839,AAAAAA==,But I'll admit, I detest violence myself.
Such dirty business is best delegated.
3903840,AAAAAA==,However, this dam is still undergoing
consultation and lacks the proper security.
3903841,AAAAAA==,Ah well, nothing for it. I'll just have to
take out these fools myself.
3903842,AAAAAA==,Mwahahaha... I feel so alive...!
3903843,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What's with this guy!?
3903844,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Stay vigilant! I can sense his power
growing by the second!
3903845,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,He's attacking!
3903900,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,All right! It's working! Let's keep it up!
3903846,AAAAAA==,You're going to regret underestimating me!
3903847,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,He seems to be absorbing desire... and
filling that apparatus with its <color=#FF423F>energy</color>.
3903848,AAAAAA==,It looks like I have some waste to
dispose of!
3903849,AAAAAA==,I'm really no good with violence.
How's this?
3903850,AAAAAA==,Ahhh, I feel like a new man.
3903851,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What the‚Äî!? Did he just heal himself!?
3903852,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes. It seems the energy in his armor has
restorative properties.
3903853,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Still, it's likely finite. A steady offense
should eventually wear him down.
3903854,AAAAAA==,My, what tenacious little fools. I suppose
I'll have to spare no effort.
3903855,AAAAAA==,I'm not quite sated, but I've gotten enough
of a taste. Your attacks are powerless
against me now.
3903856,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh? Taste"!? A taste of what!?
3903857	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He's analyzed our attacks and made himself
immune to them. What a nuisance. We'll need
to act carefully.
3903858	AAAAAA==	*chuckle* Time to turn it up a notch.
This next one may shock you.
3903859	AAAAAA==	Now for your free consultation. This will
hurt quite a bit.
3903901	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I thought we were in trouble at first	 but
we got him on the ropes!
3903902	AAAAAA==	Excuuuse me?
3903903	AAAAAA==	Ahhh... This is exactly why I can't stand
little fools who know nothing but violence.
3903904	AAAAAA==	But I can use fools... They don't understand
the hierarchy at play.
3903905	AAAAAA==	Hmph... You leave me no choice. So your
feeble brains can comprehend...
3903906	AAAAAA==	It's time I give you a thorough consulting!
3903907	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is it‚Äî!?
3903908	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It healed all of the damage we've dealt
so far!
3903909	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're kidding! So our attacks were all
for nothing?
3903910	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. And if we keep battling like this	 it's
possible it'll just keep recovering!
3903911	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Continuing to fight isn't a good idea!
Wonder	 give us your orders!
3903913	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Understood!
3903950	AAAAAA==	They're gone... Fools are quick to turn tail
and run.
3903951	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems it left.
3903952	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*sigh* Thank god.
3903953	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That Shadow healed itself completely.
Is it invincible?
3903954	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There was that cable thing it stuck into
the ground.
3903955	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe that gave it a power boost or helped
it recover or something?
3903956	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It did seem that way. Almost as if it
absorbed the energy of the Palace through
that cable.
3903958	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... It may have to do with the Palace
being shaped like a dam.
3903959	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You mean it's sapping electricity made by
the dam and using it to power itself?
3903960	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 isn't that cheating!? We could hammer
away at that thing for years and it wouldn't
take a scratch!
3903961	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a cognitive stronghold of the
ruler's own design. Unfairness is to
be expected.
3903962	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But	 this is Katayama's Palace	 isn't it?
What's a thing like that doing here in
the first place?
3903963	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have no idea. I've never seen anything
like this before. Anyway...
3903964	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Even if we manage to get past the Shadow	
there's still the number lock to
contend with.
3903965	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's head back to reality and plan our next
course of action.
3903980	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should retreat for now. Let's return
to reality	 Wonder.
3904020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew! Glad we made it back safely.
3904021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That weird Shadow from earlier... Was that
supposed to be Ms. Katayama's Shadow?
3904022	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No way in hell! That disgusting creep
couldn't possibly be her!
3904023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows exist in conjunction with their
real-life counterparts. They manifest the
desires of their other self.
3904024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Depending on how the person perceives
themself	 their Shadow can appear vastly
different than how they look in reality.
3904025	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay sure	 but there's a limit. Didn't that
thing have a man's voice?
3904026	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It did. And it was so far removed from my
image of Ms. Katayama	 it was almost like...
3904027	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Or I guess	 it really was like the Shadow
reminded me of a different person entirely.
3904029	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Now that you mention it	 it DID sound like
Mr. Akashi! Tone and everything!
3904030	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh yeah. It said something about "consulting"
too	 didn't it?
3904031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Consulting...?
3904032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 that's it! The voice sounded just like
Mr. Akashi's!
3904033	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh yeah. Had the same pretentious lilt to
it too.
3904034	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So that Palace wasn't Ms. Katayama's...
It was Mr. Akashi's?
3904035	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yes	 that must be it! I knew Ms. Katayama
couldn't be a Palace ruler!
3904036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I found the Palace from the name of
Kumi Katayama.
3904037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no doubt that the palace was created
by Katayama.
3904038	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No way! Why the hell would Akashi's Shadow
be in there	 then!?
3904039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's possible that Kumi Katayama's mind
constructed him as well. Like a sort of
cognitive being.
3904040	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A cognitive being... of Mr. Akashi?
3904041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Essentially	 the version of Akashi that
Katayama imagines in her heart.
3904042	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh-huuuh... So you're saying the Mr. Akashi
in her heart protects the Palace?
3904043	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I really can't see him being her knight in
shining armor though.
3904044	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. If anything	 it's the total opposite.
3904045	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 to summarize	 if that's Akashi's
cognitive being...
3904046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We may be able to overcome its invincibility
if we learn more about the relationship
between them.
3904047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right. Let's investigate what's going on
with them!
3904048	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sounds like a plan. Maybe that'll help us
find out why Katayama-san ended up with a
Palace in the first place	 too.
3904049	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think we've done enough for one day.
We should head home and get some rest.
3904119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo! Finally	 the sweet taste of stewed eggs
and roast pork! *shlurp*
3904120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Listen up	 {NAME2}! You better bring me
with you tonight! Don't forget!
3904160	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Thanks for comin'	 Shun! And same to
you	 Motoha-chan	 {NAME2}-kun.
3904161	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're happy to see you're feeling better	
Yamagoshi-san!
3904162	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	You guys have helped us out so much	 today's
meal is our treat!
3904163	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Pops and I are cookin' up each of our
special ramens	 so get ready to eat at least
two bowls!
3904164	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right! I was born ready!
3904166	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Not a problem. Your smiles are the only
thanks we need.
3904167	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't you worry! I'll eat whatever you
can't finish!
3904168	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's more worrying...
3904169	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Unfazed	 huh? Well	 that's reassuring
at least!
3904170	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Let me help you out.
3904171	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I'm fine! Sit	 sit!
3904172	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I can't believe ya haven't come by once
since the reopenin'. Some apprentice!
Ya break an ol' man's heart.
3904173	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But‚Äî! I only found out today! I woulda
come the second I knew!
3904174	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Haha. By the way	 {NAME2}-kun	 is it
really okay to give roast pork to an owl?
3904176	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	You got it! Stewed egg and roast pork for
the pet owl comin' right up!
3904177	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Haha	 it's no problem at all. Ya have the
place to yourselves today.
3904178	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I'll also throw in some stewed eggs with
the pork. Hope you're hungry	 pet owl-kun!
3904179	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Pet!?
3904180	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mmm! This is amazing! My mouth's exploding
with bonito goodness!
3904181	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Haha	 right!? That's Pops's patented flavor.
3904182	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hooaaah!
3904183	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is life-changing! How dare you three
keep this flavor all to yourselves!? The
nerve...
3904184	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Like we had a choice? You can't bring an owl
into a restaurant. We had to book the place
out just so you could try the food.
3904185	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyway	 should you be talking right now? Pops
and Masa-san would freak out if they heard
you.
3904186	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You don't have to worry about that. Regular
people can't hear my voice.
3904187	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Only people with strong potential for desire	
who can use the Metaverse Navigator	 are able
to understand me.
3904188	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yamagoshi and Masa have desires	 but not the
strength of heart that you all possess.
3904189	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't really get it	 but I guess that's
just how it is...
3904190	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Shun	 what're you muttering to yourself
about?
3904191	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahhh	 I think I died and went to heaven.
3904192	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Haha	 think you have room for seconds? I was
just about to start cooking my ramen.
3904193	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes	 please! Of course I do!
3904194	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Too loud and too fast!
3904195	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	This is great. Seein' you all eat your fill
makes me so happy.
3904196	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	That reminds me	 you two are in Kumi-chan's
class	 aren't ya?
3904197	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kumi-chan? Oh	 you mean Ms. Katayama! Do you
two know each other?
3904198	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoops. Did I forget to mention that? Pops
and Masa-san were hopin' to ask about her
today.
3904199	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ms. Katayama and Masa-san were both regulars
here since they were students	 right?
3904200	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	That's right. Kumi-chan came by a lot when
she was around your age.
3904201	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	But they were both such wild kids back then	
you'd hardly recognize 'em.
3904202	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Well	 umm... Let's just call that the
rashness of youth. Sorry about all that.
3904203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What!? Wild? Do you mean you were like	
delinquents...?
3904204	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Yup. You could say they're both reformed
delinquents.
3904205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ms. Katayama's an ex-delinquent!?
3904207	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right!? It's really hard to believe seeing
how she is now.
3904208	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Um	 hello!?
3904209	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You do know we're in the middle of talking
about Katayama-san now	 right?
3904210	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hang on	 I can't imagine the teacher we know
now as a delinquent!
3904211	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	She was famous back then	 you know. Lightning
Legs Katayama	 they called her.
3904212	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Lightning Legs!?
3904213	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's the first I heard a this. What's it
mean?
3904214	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Back then there were four big gang leaders
in the city.
3904215	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Kumi-chan was one of 'em	 and they were all
fightin' for control over the rest.
3904216	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! That's like something out of a manga!
3904217	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	One time	 a student was attacked near Arakawa
River	 so she rode her bike all the way there
to serve up some justice.
3904218	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	This other time	 she took down a whole gang
of delinquents from another school with just
a left kick.
3904219	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Just a kick? So that's why she's Lightning
Legs! That's so awesome!
3904220	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Ah	 well that's part of it	 but she was
really known for pedaling her bike crazy
fast.
3904221	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	When the gang went out on our motorcycles at
night	 she'd put a light on her bicycle an
pedal after us till she caught up.
3904222	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 that's why she's Lightning Legs...
3904223	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh... When you put it like that it sounds
pretty cringey...
3904224	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Kumi-chan's parents didn't get along	 so she
didn't really have a safe place to call home.
3904225	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	She'd go ridin' her bike all over the place
tryin' to forget about her troubles.
3904226	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	She'd always stop by on her way home for a
bowl a ramen sayin'	 "I rode to the dam
today!"
3904227	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The dam!?
3904228	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	Ya musta noticed she's got a bit of a short
fuse. Back then it got 'er mixed up in all
kinds a fights with other delinquents.
3904229	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	But her homeroom teacher in second year was
real sympathetic to 'er.
3904230	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	So she quit all a that and started studyin'
hard to be a teacher.
3904231	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	'Round the same time	 Masa turned over a new
leaf and started studyin' ramen.
3904232	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow!
3904233	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Here you go! Hope you enjoy the ramen that
came about from all that!
3904234	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	I'll bring over Shun's bowl and some roasted
pork for the owl right away!
3904235	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 I'll get them!
3904236	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks for the meal!
3904237	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thank you so much! That was seriously
delicious!
3904238	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	'Course! Get home safe	 ya hear? And come by
again sometime.
3904239	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Come by Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku too!
3904240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! Of course we will!
3904241	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 is that it? I was hoping to ask more
about Katayama and Akashi.
3904242	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh yeah	 that's right.
3904243	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 Yamagoshi-san	 Masa-san	 you've known
Ms. Katayama for a long time...
3904244	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do you know a man named Akashi? Kei Akashi.
3904245	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Akashi? Never heard of him.
3904246	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi	I never heard of him either. Why do you ask?
3904247	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 no reason! I was just wondering.
3904248	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyway	 thanks again for the feast today!
3904300	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wooow. Call me a turkey	 'cause I'm stuffed!
That was... the greatest few hours of my
life.
3904301	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And I finally got to savor that scrumptious
pork and stewed eggs. The flavor was just...
so... exquisite.
3904302	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But the only way I can enjoy that sublime
dish again is to rent out the entire
restaurant...?
3904303	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll make it for you if you want. Mine's
nowhere near as good as Pops's though.
3904304	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh! I'll hold you to that	 Shun! In fact	 you
can make it every day if you want!
3904305	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Still.... I was shocked to hear about
Ms. Katayama's past. Did you know any of
that	 Shun?
3904306	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'd heard a bit about it from Masa-san. The
Lightning Legs thing was news to me though.
3904307	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 I can't believe she could cycle all the
way to the dam!
3904308	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah... Maybe that's why her Palace is a dam?
3904309	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Could be.
3904310	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And yet	 neither of them seem to have any
recollection of Akashi's name.
3904311	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. They must be connected somehow	 but
seems like they weren't fellow delinquents.
3904312	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that Palace must be Katayama's after
all.
3904313	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3904314	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 anyhoo	 we should continue
investigating the relationship between the
two of them.
3904360	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Hey there.
3904361	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What's that?
3904362	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	A gift. Don't you ever feel like drinking
plum juice when you're tired?
3904363	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Ah	 but you're probably tired of drinking
the same stuff you have at home...
3904364	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No	 not at all. Thank you for buying it for
me.
3904365	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	However	 as a disciplinary committee member	
I cannot accept favors from teachers.
3904366	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	As serious as ever.
3904367	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	You should say no to the academic coordinator
too. Don't just accept whatever he tells you
to do.
3904368	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I don't mind the work.
3904369	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Really? What kind of work is he...
3904370	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Why is he having you compile this kind of
data? It has nothing to do with the students.
3904371	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Mr. Yamanashi and computers don't mix.
3904372	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I like helping teachers with things I'm good
at.
3904373	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Do you really mean that? Because it looks
like you're pushing yourself too hard to me.
3904374	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I thought maybe you were sacrificing yourself
to play the model student everyone expects
you to be.
3904375	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Ever since back then...
3904376	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	......
3904377	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Even if that were true	 where's the problem?
3904378	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Huh?
3904379	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I am fulfilling the role that's expected of
me. Why should I have to feel guilty about
that?
3904380	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Because students... Children	 should be
allowed to live their lives freely!
3904381	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	This is the time for you to discover what you
like and think about what you want for your
life.
3904382	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Us adults are supposed to support that! Not
crush children's hopes!
3904383	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What I want is to prove myself useful to the
faculty.
3904384	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why are you so concerned with what I'm doing?
Does me staying busy trouble you in some way?
3904385	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Well... I've been worried about you for a
long time now...
3904386	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Am I getting preferential treatment because
I'm supposed to inherit Umetane?
3904387	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What!?
3904388	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
3904389	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But you're no longer my homeroom teacher	
so you don't need to worry about me anymore.
3904390	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Tanemura-san...
3904391	AAAAAA==	All right	 all right. That's enough. Pack it
in	 Ms. Katayama.
3904392	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Mr. Akashi...?
3904393	AAAAAA==	Contact with students outside of class is
strictly prohibited. How many times must you
be told?
3904394	AAAAAA==	That must have been scary. Are you all right	
Tanemura-san?
3904395	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm completely fine... What are you doing
here	 Mr. Akashi?
3904396	AAAAAA==	You've been doing the work I asked the
academic coordinator to complete	 correct?
3904397	AAAAAA==	I remembered that	 so I was on my way here to
check when I heard Ms. Katayama yelling.
3904398	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Yelling!?
3904399	AAAAAA==	Thank goodness I made it in time before she
got violent with another student.
3904400	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Violent!? I'd never do anything of the sort!
3904401	AAAAAA==	Oh look	 there's that temper of yours again.
3904402	AAAAAA==	Ms. Katayamaaa	 students are not children.
They are individuals.
3904403	AAAAAA==	Scolding them and suppressing their autonomy
is a thing of the past. We must all respect each
other as independent people.
3904404	AAAAAA==	Those kinds of boundaries are crucial. But
you don't seem to realize	 what you're doing
is just...
3904405	AAAAAA==	...self-gratification	 isn't it?
3904406	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Me!? You're the assholes using her for your
own gain!
3904407	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	You call these reforms!? Why are you leaving
students to fend for themselves!?
3904408	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	The teachers are taking it easy and putting
all the burden on her! How is that
education!?
3904409	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Tanemura-san is already struggling with her
responsibilities to her family!
3904410	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Don't make her bear such a heavy burden
anymore! Stop making her suffer!
3904411	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sensei...?
3904412	AAAAAA==	What do you think you're doing	
Ms. Katayama!?
3904413	AAAAAA==	Are you okay	 Mr. Akashi? I'm glad I noticed
your message.
3904414	AAAAAA==	This is a clear act of violence	
Ms. Katayama! What on earth do you think
you're doing!?
3904415	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	N-No	 it's not... I...
3904416	AAAAAA==	Whoa	 she really is a violent teacher! I got
the best part on camera!
3904417	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	*gasp* You...
3904418	AAAAAA==	You!? You recorded that!?
3904419	AAAAAA==	I mean	 we were just waiting out here for
Mr. Akashi to come back foreeever.
3904420	AAAAAA==	He promised he'd help us more with our
videos.
3904421	AAAAAA==	Give me that phone! Delete the video!
3904422	AAAAAA==	Whoa	 yikes! Definitely not doing that!
3904423	AAAAAA==	Enough! Mr. Akashi	 please deal with these
kids! And you	 Ms. Katayama...!
3904424	AAAAAA==	I'll hear what you have to say for yourself
in the faculty offi‚Äî No	 the reception
office!
3904425	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Okay...
3904426	AAAAAA==	There's no use in denying it. I recorded the
whole thing as well.
3904427	AAAAAA==	Tanemura-kun... Go home for today! And tell
no one about this! Got it!?
3904428	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	He recorded the whole thing?
3904429	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Mr. Akashi has been wearing his smart glasses
all day for some reason.
3904430	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Was he already recording when he entered
the room?
3904431	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And the timing of the academic coordinator
and those two girls showing up to meet
Mr. Akashi was too convenient...
3904432	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So that means...
3904470	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 {NAME1}! This is bad!
3904471	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san is‚Äî!?
3904473	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It says the reason was "violent behavior on
school property." But she would never‚Äî
3904474	AAAAAA==	I heard she grabbed Mr. Akashi by the collar
and threatened him. She's totally off the
deep end.
3904475	AAAAAA==	Huh? Poor Mr. Akashi... Katayama really is a
Menace. She's lost it.
3904476	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san wouldn't hurt a fly!
3904477	AAAAAA==	W-What are you talking about!? If she didn't
do anything	 this wouldn't be happening	
would it?
3904478	F<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ippant Male Student	Only a matter of time till she's condemned
now. Should we post a pic of the notice to
Divine Justice?
3904479	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Don't you dare!
3904480	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Quiet	 everyone.
3904481	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	First period is about to start. Report to
your classrooms at once.
3904482	AAAAAA==	Tanemura-senpai	 is it true you were there
when it went down?
3904483	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Where did you hear that?
3904484	AAAAAA==	Whoa	 it's true! Set this guy straight then.
Tell him she's a violent Menace of a teacher.
3904485	AAAAAA==	She was suspended for being a Menace	 right?
3904486	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Enough wild speculating.
3904487	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The other teachers are handling
Ms. Katayama's load while she's serving her
suspension.
3904488	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So there's no point in us making a fuss over
it. Now get to class before you're all late.
3904489	AAAAAA==	Ugh	 you're no fun!
3904490	AAAAAA==	And I was sure the disciplinary committee
chair would tear Katayama to shreds...
3904491	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 Riko-senpai... Is it true that you saw
what happened?
3904492	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	......
3904493	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're going to be late too. Head to class.
3904494	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay...
3904495	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But...
3904496	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That rumor spread quickly. Maybe too
quickly...
3904540	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I can't believe Ms. Katayama's suspended
indefinitely...
3904541	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Rumor has it Ms. Katayama and Riko had an
argument in the Student Guidance Office. When
Mr. Akashi rushed to the scene...
3904542	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ms. Katayama attacked him	 which the
academic coordinator and a number of other
students witnessed.
3904543	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why would Ms. Katayama do something like
that?
3904544	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And to Akashi of all people... It's just like
in the Metaverse.
3904545	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Would things have gone differently if we'd
been able to take down the Palace?
3904546	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we'd defeated that Akashi-lookin'
Shadow... Could we have prevented this?
3904547	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I understand your point	 but let's think
rationally for a moment.
3904548	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That being is probably not Akashi's Shadow.
I hypothesize that it may be a cognitive form
born from Katayama's mind.
3904549	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we had defeated it	 Katayama's feelings
toward Akashi in real life may have changed	
but...
3904550	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So if we'd defeated it	 Ms. Katayama might
not have used violence against Mr. Akashi?
3904551	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But isn't it weird? Why was he the one
protecting Ms. Katayama's Palace?
3904552	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't get why someone she hates enough to
throw hands with would be the symbol that
protects her heart.
3904553	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Neither do I.
3904554	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But if Akashi's showin' up in her Palace	
he must be a big deal to Katayama-san in some
respect.
3904555	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In any case	 let's investigate Akashi. We
know for a fact he's connected to the Palace.
3904556	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. But how are we gonna do that? Should we
try asking the other teachers?
3904557	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Asking them what?
3904558	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	R-Riko-senpai!?
3904559	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm sorry	 I didn't intend to eavesdrop	
but I just want to confirm...
3904560	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Were you talking about investigating
Mr. Akashi?
3904562	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Who can say	 right? What were we talking
about again...? *whistling*
3904563	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're awful at whistling.
3904564	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We were just talkin' about how worried we are
about Ms. Katayama...
3904565	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What a coincidence. I was also thinking of
investigating Mr. Akashi.
3904566	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Would you like to work together on this?
3904567	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3904569	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Well... I can't say any more about it here
at school.
3904570	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey now! First you eavesdrop	 now you're
tellin' us to help you without givin' a
reason?
3904571	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Shun! Don't be rude!
3904572	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We need to know.
3904573	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You were there when it happened	 right?
3904574	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ms. Disciplinary Committee was right there on
the scene	 but didn't do anything to stop
her?
3904575	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're right. I am somewhat at fault for not
stopping her.
3904576	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But I want to investigate Mr. Akashi to find
out why this situation occurred in the first
place.
3904577	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
3904578	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I need time to explain	 so perhaps we could
meet somewhere off campus?
3904580	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Thank you. I'll message you with the details
then	 Motoha.
3904581	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 sure! Sounds good!
3904582	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She feels guilty about it	 huh? Maybe we can
trust her then.
3904583	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's the spirit	 Shun.
3904584	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But to think that someone was eavesdropping
on us. Some hideout this is.
3904585	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha... We'll have to keep a closer eye on
our surroundings next time.
3904586	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But Riko-senpai... I wonder where all this isn
coming from.
3904620	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I got a message from Riko-senpai. She wants
to know if we can meet after school.
3904621	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She said she has some errands to run first	
so she wants us to meet her in Kichijoji
tonight.
3904622	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay. Shun's good to go too.
3904623	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's meet at Shimo-Kitazawa Station in the
evening and head to <color=#FF423F>Kichijoji</color> together.
3904650	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 hey! You're here!
3904651	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's all of us. Let's get to Kichijoji.
3904680	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So...
We're meeting at a <color=#FF423F>caf√©</color>	 right?
3904681	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	My map is showing a lot of
imported food vendors ahead...
3904682	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's goin' on over there?
Looks like they're filmin' somethin'.
3904683	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh? Isn't that Riko Tanemura
in front of the camera over there?
3904730	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Umetane's umeboshi will be sold at Kichijoji
Station until the end of the week.
3904731	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Please stop by if you happen to be
in the area.
3904732	AAAAAA==	All right! That's a wrap!
3904733	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Thank you very much.
3904734	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You look absolutely adorable	 Riko-senpai!
Is this for TV!?
3904735	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Oh	 I'm sorry.
It's already the time that we agreed to meet	
isn't it?
3904736	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'll be finished soon.
Would you mind waiting a little?
3904737	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Was that an interview?
Wow! It's like you're a celebrity
or something!
3904738	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is Ms. Disciplinary Committee moonlighting
as a model?
3904739	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No	 I'm simply helping the family business.
 That was an ad for our shop.
3904740	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It will only make a brief appearance
on the evening news.
3904741	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Family business? What kind of business?
3904742	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 you don't know	 Shun?
Her father's the president of Umetane.
3904743	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Umetane!?
3904744	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	As in Umetane umeboshi and pickles!?
The ones in all those commercials on TV!?
3904746	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Nah. I knew she was some kinda heiress	
but I had no idea it was to Umetane.
3904747	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm a huge fan of your umeboshi!
3904748	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Oh	 so you're a regular of ours?
Thank you so much for your patronage.
3904749	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's pretty funny watching Shun turn
on a dime like that.
3904750	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Lay off! It's a secret ingredient in my
broth. Their stuff is super high quality.
3904751	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	'Course it is. They make the best umeboshi
out there!
3904752	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I use it as a secret ingredient in my broth	
so you could say I owe a lot to Umetane.
3904753	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Oh	 so you're a regular of ours?
Thank you so much for your patronage.
3904754	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No prob.
3904755	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By the way	 your outfit is really cute	
Riko-senpai. It looks amazing on you!
3904757	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You think so? Thank you.
3904758	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 thank you. I appreciate that	
even if it's just flattery.
3904759	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî!? How can you say that	 {NAME2}!?
3904760	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It looks amazing! She's beautiful!
Anyone could pull it off. What are you even saying?
3904761	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 thanks	 Motoha.
But I think he might be right.
3904762	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3904763	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Anyway	 I can't go to the caf√© dressed like
this	 can I?
3904764	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Please go ahead and wait for me there.
I'll come meet you as soon as
I've finished changing.
3904800	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sorry to keep you all waiting
after inviting you out.
3904801	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No	 it's no problem at all!
But when will you be on TV!?
I'll be sure to watch!
3904802	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 the umeboshi is the star of the show	
so I doubt you will see all that much of me.
3904803	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Anyway	 back to the topic at hand...
3904804	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You wanna look into Akashi	 right?
3904805	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You did actually see it go down	 right?
Did Katayama really attack him?
3904806	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I guess that's a good place to start from.
I'll tell you everything I saw.
3904807	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It sounds like Mr. Akashi was purposely
trying to provoke Ms. Katayama.
3904808	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The two students who gave her trouble before
 just happened to be there to witness it?
Way too convenient	 if you ask me.
3904809	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Well	 since you're only hearing my side
of the story it may be a little
subjective	 but...
3904810	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It seems like you've all come to the same
conclusion I did. There are too many
of these "coincidences" to overlook.
3904811	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you mean?
3904812	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	First of all	 Ms. Katayama was told
not to make contact with students
outside of class.
3904813	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 now that you mention it	 Mr. Akashi
did say something like that to her.
3904814	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But it seems that Ms. Katayama continued
reaching out to students she was
concerned about.
3904815	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 when she's worried about her students	
she can't just throw 'em to the lions.
She's not that kinda person.
3904816	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're right.
But what if someone
decided to use that against her?
3904818	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes	 that's right.
3904819	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Mr. Akashi's been following Ms. Katayama
and interfering at every turn. It's been a
source of frustration for her.
3904820	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Apparently it's been happening frequently...
You witnessed a similar incident yourself	
didn't you	 Kano-kun?
3904821	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... Akashi interrupted us when we were
talking to Katayama-san on the roof.
3904822	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah! I remember that!
I was wondering what he was doing there!
3904823	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And now that she's being treated like a
Menace	 Ms. Katayama seems to be in an
emotionally vulnerable state.
3904824	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Then there's her sense of responsibility
to the students. Not being allowed to interact
with them is making matters worse.
3904825	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	She could explode at any time.
That's the state she was in when she came to talk
to me that day.
3904826	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And you're saying Akashi	
knowing all of that...
3904827	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes. He confronted her after having arranged
for the academic coordinator and those two
girls to witness everything.
3904828	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Maybe it sounds too contrived to believe.
3904829	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well... Now that you mention it...
3904830	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I have another reason to doubt Mr. Akashi.
His smart glasses.
3904831	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	His what? Oh	 you mean those lame
specs he wears?
3904832	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes. I think Mr. Akashi was recording
from the second he entered the room.
3904833	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	He was convinced he could make Ms. Katayama
turn violent on him	 so...
3904834	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So that means...!
3904836	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's still too early to say.
3904837	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It may just be speculation on my part	
but I believe there's good reason to be
suspicious of him.
3904838	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I did a little research on Mr. Akashi.
It seems he used to work as a
business consultant.
3904839	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	With his help	 all of his client companies
improved and achieved great success.
3904840	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Most comments about him online praise his
skill as a consultant...
3904841	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But I found some more interesting posts
on anonymous message boards.
3904842	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This...
3904843	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	After I disagreed with his methods,
my reputation at work took a huge hit,
and I was forced to resign.
3904844	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There's another account of an employee
who Akashi falsely accused of fraud. During
the litigation	 they committed suicide.
3904845	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Suicide!?
3904846	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp* If this is all true	 we've got a very
dangerous person on our hands!
3904847	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Stay calm. They are just internet posts	
so there's no way to know if they're real.
That said...
3904848	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The "work reform" he's been pushing
demoralizes the teachers and makes students
less trusting of them.
3904849	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	At the very least	 I can't see that his work
as a consultant was done with the best
intentions in mind.
3904850	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Rather	 he solves problems by force so that
he alone is in a position to succeed.
3904851	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I knew it! I didn't trust that guy
from the start!
3904852	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So he really set Katayama-san up!?
Damn that bastard!
3904853	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And these rumors of people dying...
Could that be what's in store for her too?
3904854	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Senpai	 what can we do about this!?
What else should we investigate!?
3904855	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hold on	 Shun! Don't be so rash!
{NAME2}	 talk some sense into him!
3904856	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're all far too quick to trust Tanemura.
What if she's secretly on Akashi's side!?
3904857	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Did that owl just...?
3904858	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No... Maybe I'm hearing things...
3904859	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should figure out why she wants to help
with our investigation first	 {NAME2}.
3904861	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why?
3904862	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Because I felt that you also believed
in Ms. Katayama and were suspicious
of Mr. Akashi.
3904863	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Anyway	 that's all the information I have
to give. Do you all know anything?
3904864	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	My goal? Well...
3904865	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I just want to know what Mr. Akashi
is up to. I reached out to you because you're
suspicious of him too.
3904866	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Anyway	 that's all the information I have
to give. Do you all know anything?
3904867	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We don't have a clue...
3904868	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	If that's the case	 would you help me
obtain more information?
3904869	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We can investigate together and share
the information we find. 
What do you think?
3904870	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So she's suggesting an alliance of those
suspicious of Akashi... A deal of sorts.
3904871	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It benefits both sides	 and seems credible
 enough. What should we do	 {NAME2}?
3904873	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's settled then. Thank you.
3904874	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No	 thank you! It's really reassuring
to have you on our side	 Riko-senpai!
3904876	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We're counting on you	 Senpai. Sorry for
being a bit confrontational at first...
3904877	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's okay. And seeing as we're all only
a year apart	 please feel free to speak to me
more casually.
3904878	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So... How are we gonna get the dirt
on Mr. Akashi?
3904879	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I have an idea	 but it will take a bit of
explaining. Will you hear me out?
3904900	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Excuse meeee! Is Mr. Akashi here?
3904901	AAAAAA==	You're the student who had a disagreement
with Ms. Katayama. Arai-san	 was it?
3904902	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha	 thanks for coming to my rescue!
3904903	AAAAAA==	Oh?
But I thought you were on her side?
3904904	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way! That was before I found out
how violent she is!
3904905	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyways... I have some ideas to improve
the school if you don't mind listening.
3904906	AAAAAA==	Yes	 of course. I always have time
for students' requests.
3904907	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yay! Then I'll cut right to the chase...
3904908	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I want more pastries in the school store!
The selection of sweets is really lacking!
3904909	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 I also had an idea for a school event!
I would looove if we could hold
a baseball tournament!
3904910	AAAAAA==	J-Just a moment	 Arai-san. It seems this may
become a lengthy discussion	 so I'll need to
set aside time to talk another day.
3904911	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Perhaps you could take a break now
to discuss with her?
3904912	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You must be getting exhausted of all this
desk work	 Mr. Akashi. I'll finish organizing
the data for you.
3904913	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Awesome! Let's go talk on the roof	 Sensei!
The breeze up there is great!
3904914	AAAAAA==	Hmmm...
3904915	AAAAAA==	Very well. If you insist.
I'll step out for a moment to talk.
3904916	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's go! Come on!
3904917	AAAAAA==	All right	 all right. I'm coming.
3904918	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	As I expected	 he left them behind.
3904919	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	He often changes to his tinted glasses
when he's in front of students. Maybe it's
to look more relatable?
3904920	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Man	 Motoha really knows how to sell it.
That act was flawless.
3904921	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I always thought Motoha had nerves of steel
ever since we were kids. I gave her a script
to work with for today	 but...
3904922	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	She really outdid herself.
I bet she could have a future in theater.
3904923	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Anyway	 keep a lookout while I search.
3904924	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	He's probably not careless enough
to write down his password. Maybe something
can give me a hint...
3904925	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Messages... Photos...
3904926	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's not it. Maybe this'll work...
3904927	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 you almost done?
They'll be back any minute!
3904928	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Don't worry. I think I've figured it out...
3904929	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Bingo.
3904930	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa	 for real!?
How'd you do that!?
3904931	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'll explain later. This takes priority.
3904932	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There's a hidden folder here filled with
image and video files...
Huh? This is...
3904933	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	*gasp*
3904934	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I knew it...
3904936	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes	 we've got it.
All thanks to you three.
3904937	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Now to copy everything.
Is there anything else of note?
3904938	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Motoha is on her way back? Got it.
You two should get out of here quickly.
3904939	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Let's reconvene at the caf√©
in Kichijoji later.
3904940	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Gotcha.
Be careful	 Senpai.
3904970	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm sorry to make you come all this way
again. I thought it best if we met somewhere
far from school.
3904971	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Today is my treat	 so order
whatever you'd like.
3904972	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What!? No	 that's waaaay too generous!
3904973	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Without all of you	 I couldn't have hacked
Akashi's PC. It's the least I can do.
3904974	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 Motoha's performance particularly
stole the show.
3904976	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I can't take all the credit.
Riko-senpai wrote the script for me!
3904977	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Besides	 I was totally serious about
the pastries and baseball tournament!
3904978	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 so it wasn't just an act...
That explains it.
3904979	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Still	 it was very impressive.
No one would have doubted you for a second.
3904980	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So	 what would you like to eat	 Motoha?
3904981	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 I guess I'll order my fill then!
Let's see...
3904982	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So	 in regard to Akashi's PC...
3904983	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I didn't have time to examine everything	
but I found several photos and videos
of Ms. Katayama.
3904984	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	All compiled in their own special folder.
3904985	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp* That's...
3904987	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No. If anything	
I think he's trying to find her weakness.
3904988	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Case in point	 he had copies of the footage
taken by those two students stored on his PC.
3904989	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait	 didn't Akashi say he deleted that?
3904990	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes. He told the academic coordinator
as much... but it turns out that was a lie.
3904991	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So the one who posted her name
to Divine Justice was...!
3904992	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I can't say for certain since the post was
anonymous	 but it's highly plausible.
3904993	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I haven't reviewed all the data yet	
but I can contact you once I'm finished.
3904994	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes	 please! Thank you so much.
3904995	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait. You should inquire about the password
to Akashi's PC.
3904996	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It could be the key to unlocking that door
in Katayama's Palace.
3904997	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 good thinkin'!
3904998	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	By the way	 Senpai	 what was Akashi's
password? How'd you figure it out?
3904999	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Oh right. It was his old employee ID number.
3905000	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Before Mr. Akashi became a consultant	
apparently he worked at a TV station.
3905001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A TV station!?
Wow	 that guy really is a big shot...
3905002	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The album in his smart glasses had a lot
of photos from that time.
3905003	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	His employee ID was the only close-up	
so I thought it must be important...
3905004	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It was worth a try	 and I was right.
Of course	 I had several other guesses
in mind.
3905005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're real sharp.
If I had to figure that out	 I'd be screwed.
3905006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 um	 could you tell us the number?
3905007	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I suppose so	 but why?
3905008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 well	 you know	 it'll be helpful
if we want to investigate more and stuff.
3905009	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Since it's you three	 I don't mind.
But do you promise not to misuse it?
3905011	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hm... All right.
3905012	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	On second thought...
3905013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	W-We'll definitely behave!
He's just uhhh	 sleepy! Yeah	 sleepy.
Isn't that right...?
3905014	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hm... All right.
3905015	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Do you have something to write with?
3905016	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 yeah! Just a sec!
Notebook	 notebook...
3905040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now that we've obtained Akashi's password	
I'm confident we can get through that lock.
3905041	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Great!
Let's head to the Palace right now!
3905042	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Next stop	 Shibuya!
3905043	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hey	 I'm back.
3905044	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Thanks for the meal	 Riko-senpai!
3905045	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thank you!
3905046	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're very welcome.
So	 where are you all headed?
3905047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 um	 right. I've got homework and stuff	
so I should hurry back home!
3905048	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 I'm gonna head back and hit the hay.
3905050	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I see. Take care then.
Be careful on your way home.
3905051	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Will do! See you at school	 Riko-senpai!
3905052	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks a bunch!
3905053	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	They're definitely up to something...
3905054	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What does "heading to the Palace" mean?
Also...
3905057	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The voice that asked for the password...
It didn't belong to any of them.
3905090	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All right	 let's get to the Metaverse!
3905091	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right. However	 this visit may be especially
challenging. We'd best prepare accordingly.
3905092	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You can take care of the shopping	 Leader!
We'll wait right here for you!
3905093	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ready to go?
3905120	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	They said they were going home... What are
they doing?
3905095	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 let's roll!
3905096	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 we'll wait here then. Give us a shout
when you're ready!
3905121	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	They vanished!?
3905122	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But they were here just a sec‚Äî!
3905123	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	This notebook... So	 they definitely were
here.
3905124	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What is going on? Let me try Motoha...
3905125	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What's this icon?
3905150	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	*gasp* Where am I!?
3905151	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	How did I...?
3905152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Okay	 let's review our objective.
3905153	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll head to the third area and go back to
that password protected door in Katayama's
Palace. Understood?
3905154	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Roger that!
3905155	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cattle	 do your thing!
3905156	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What... just happened?
3905157	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What did I just see? Some... something	
transformed into a car	 and those three...
3905158	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ah!
3905190	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right	 let's enter that password. Got your
notebook	 Shun?
3905191	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 one sec.
3905192	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hm? That's weird. Where is it?
3905193	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Ah! No freakin' way! It's gone!?
3905194	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What!? You're kidding me! Did you drop it!?
3905195	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe it's in the car... Sorry	 Lufel. I need
you to transform again.
3905196	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm? If something were inside me	 I think I
would know... But if you insist.
3905197	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hooaha! Hooahahaha! Th-That tickles! There is
nothing down there	 I swear it!
3905198	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What the heck? If I dropped it	 it should be
around here...
3905199	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hooaaah! Do not pull that! I'm sensitive
there!
3905200	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey! That is quite enough! Did you lose it in
the real world	 perchance!?
3905201	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyway	 does no one remember the password!?
3905202	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No. I had it in my notebook	 so I only
glanced at the number. I think it started
with a 9 maybe?
3905203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? I thought it was an 8? I remember it
being kind of long...
3905205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	None of you have the faintest idea	 do you!?
3905206	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You don't remember it either	 Cattle?
3905207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you recall	 I didn't get to see the
number! I was inside Wonder's bag!
3905208	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay okay	 I'm sorry. Don't be mad.
3905209	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You just riffled through my insides looking
for that password! I'm livid!
3905210	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	SKREEEE!
3905211	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh... What are you doing?
3905212	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That was a warning screech! It means I'm
furious with you!
3905213	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Furious...
3905214	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It just looked like a cute pose to me.
3905215	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 if it's lost	 it's lost. We'll just
have to go back to the real world and ask
Riko-senpai again.
3905216	???	That won't be necessary.
3905217	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm here. And I know the passcode.
3905218	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wha‚Äî How‚Äî Huh!?
3905219	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Riko-senpai!?
3905221	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Even with those masks	 I can tell you're
{NAME1}-kun	 Motoha	 and Shun-kun.
3905222	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And you there	 in the strange hood. I heard
your voice coming from {NAME1}-kun's
bag	 didn't I?
3905223	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My word! You could hear me all along?
3905224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Please call me Cattle. That is my Metaverse
code name.
3905225	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Cattle-san... It's nice to meet you. Does
everyone else have code names too?
3905227	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 this is no time for introductions!
Senpai	 why are you in the Metaverse?
3905228	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The Metaverse? I see. So this place is a
universe separate from our own? I can't
believe something like this exists.
3905229	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	As to why I'm here... I haven't a
clue either.
3905230	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I saw you vanish at Shibuya Station	 then
I opened an odd app on my phone and found
myself here.
3905231	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	An odd app? So the Metaverse Navigator was
on your phone too?
3905232	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The app icon was an eerie looking snake.
3905233	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. Then there's no mistaking it.
3905234	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This might be a stupid question	 but aren't
we really far from the entrance right now?
3905235	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How the heck did you get all this way
by yourself!?
3905236	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah! You weren't attacked by Shadows	
uh... I mean	 monsters	 were you!?
3905237	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Shadows? I don't know what those are	 but I
didn't run into any trouble.
3905238	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I had this one to guide me.
3905239	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî!? What is that!?
3905240	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm not sure	 but I just followed where
it led me.
3905241	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There was no other clear path to follow
after all. Oh	 is it an ally of yours?
3905242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No no! We've never seen that thing before!
3905243	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For a Shadow I'm not sensing much hostility
from it. In fact	 it's more like...
3905244	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Wait. Something is coming.
3905245	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wh-What!?
3905246	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I think my guide is trying to warn us of
some hostile danger approaching.
3905247	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes... I sense a malicious presence as well!
How could it detect that earlier than I!?
3905248	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 hang on! What malicious presence are
we talkin' about!?
3905249	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Most likely that cognitive form of Akashi.
3905250	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With Riko Tanemura here	 we can't allow
ourselves to get caught up in a battle!
3905251	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So retreating is our best option	 isn't it?
It seems our only path is through that door.
3905252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 no that's...!
3905253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Unknown peril lies beyond those doors.
We can't take you with us.
3905254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd prefer to escort you back to reality	
but...!
3905255	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There is certain danger here	 and the
possibility of danger ahead. In that case	
shouldn't we proceed forward?
3905256	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We just need to input Mr. Akashi's password
into this keypad	 right?
3905257	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 but I dropped my notebook that had
the password in it!
3905258	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It opened!
3905259	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Amazing...
3905260	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's the sound of the Akashi-looking
Shadow thing!
3905261	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do we do	 Wonder?
3905263	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've no choice! Hurry through the door!
3905290	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we go back	 we'll run into Akashi's
cognitive form. We have to press ahead	
Wonder!
3905300	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	All right. It should be locked again now.
3905301	AAAAAA==	Oh? It's still locked. I could've sworn I
sensed an invader prowling around.
3905302	AAAAAA==	But those foolish intruders from the other
day wouldn't dare return. Heheh.
3905303	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I think it's gone...
3905304	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Now that there's no immediate threat	 could
you explain this place to me?
3905305	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right... Where do we even start?
3905306	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So the "Metaverse" embodies the collective
unconscious of humankind. And this
dam facility...
3905307	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Was created by the twisted desires in
Ms. Katayama's heart. Is that correct?
3905308	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn	 you caught on fast...!
3905309	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Riko-senpai's on a whole other playing field
than us.
3905310	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And this world representing Ms. Katayama's
heart is	 for some reason	 protected by
Mr. Akashi.
3905311	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's why you were looking into him.
3905312	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. You are truly quite astute...
3905313	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	......
3905314	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Cattle-san	 are you certain this is
Ms. Katayama's Palace?
3905315	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just Cattle is fine. And yes. We were led
here by the collective unconscious using
her name.
3905316	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hence	 this is surely Katayama's Palace.
Yet	 the presence of Akashi remains
an enigma.
3905317	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes	 it is odd. I can't imagine the real
Ms. Katayama depending on Mr. Akashi in
any way.
3905318	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	In fact	 she seems hostile toward him.
3905319	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right? It's real weird.
3905320	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But Mr. Akashi's password opened the door
just now...
3905321	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why would Ms. Katayama make someone else's
password the key to her heart?
3905322	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That would imply a deep trust between them.
Or perhaps	 dependency?
3905323	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Or maybe... she's being exploited?
3905325	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Circling back	 there's no reason
Ms. Katayama could ever know his password in
the first place.
3905326	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	True. I mean	 unless they're actually a
couple or something...
3905327	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No way! Not in a million years!
3905328	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	In that case	 his password shouldn't have
opened that door.
3905329	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Through exploitation	 control	 hijacking...
Or maybe...?
3905330	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No. Without more information	 all we can do
is speculate.
3905331	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we can't go back	 let's keep movin'
forward. Maybe we'll find a hint in the Palace.
3905332	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd rather not explore with a Persona-less
human in tow	 but we haven't much choice.
3905333	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's continue our search while keeping
Riko Tanemura safe.
3905360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Akashi cognition is likely still beyond
that door.
3905361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We must continue onward	 Wonder.
3905370	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The hell is that?
3905371	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A projection of a classroom? Seems like it's
playing some kind of video...
3905400	AAAAAA==	I'll use this spray and a lighter to make
a flamethrower!
3905401	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What do you think you're doing!?
3905402	AAAAAA==	Violence is prohibited.
3905403	AAAAAA==	What kind of teacher calls a parent's
workplace just because they didn't answer
the phone!?
3905404	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Your son has been absent for three days
in a row with no explanation!
3905405	AAAAAA==	Who cares! He's just a high school kid!
That's no excuse to embarrass me at work!
3905406	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	You should be more concerned about your
child than your reputation!
3905407	AAAAAA==	Invasions of privacy are prohibited.
3905440	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What was that?
3905441	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That was footage of the lighter incident	
wasn't it?
3905443	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The scene after that was Ms. Katayama
and... someone's dad?
3905444	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	......
3905445	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh	 another video is starting.
3905470	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Is it true you fired Kano-kun? He really
seemed to love this job.
3905471	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I asked him about it	 but he just said that
it was his own fault.
3905472	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Sorry	 Kumi-chan. The truth is...
3905473	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	He threw water on a food critic!?
3905474	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sa	Yeah	 but Shun was justified. It seemed like
Miyazawa was trying to hurt our shop.
3905475	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Forget about that. Right now Kano-kun needs
us to protect him.
3905476	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	If that video goes public	 his future will
be ruined. I'll talk to the TV station.
3905477	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	So	 please	 don't give up on Kano-kun.
3905478	AAAAAA==	Meddling in private affairs is prohibited.
3905500	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So that's why the video of you throwing
water at Miyazawa never aired...
3905501	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 I heard from Masa-san afterward.
3905502	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san begged the TV station and a
bunch of other people...
3905503	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All to protect me... Even though it was
my fault!
3905520	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Sir	 I'm here today to discuss your
daughter Riko.
3905540	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This one's about Riko-senpai?
Your hair's shorter...
3905541	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	This was...
3905542	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It was when I was a first-year student.
3905543	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's right. Just before this	 Sensei...
3905580	AAAAAA==	Tanemura-san	 wanna walk home together?
3905581	AAAAAA==	A group of us are gonna hang out in Shibuya.
You should join us!
3905582	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sorry	 I have a committee meeting today.
3905583	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'll see you tomorrow. Have a nice time.
3905584	AAAAAA==	See? I told you she'd say no. Tanemura-san
can't hang.
3905585	AAAAAA==	It's always some excuse with her. Helping
her family	 committee meetings	 studying...
She's so cold!
3905586	AAAAAA==	If she doesn't wanna hang out with us	 she
should just say so.
3905587	AAAAAA==	Little miss honor student heiress can't
associate with peasants like us! Haha!
3905588	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	For the sake of my future	 perhaps I should
interact with my classmates more often.
3905589	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	For the sake of your future? That's not
quite why you should do it.
3905590	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama...
3905591	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Got a minute?
3905592	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Aren't you pushing yourself too hard	
Tanemura-san?
3905593	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I understand and admire your dedication to
your studies and your family business	 but...
3905594	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I'm a bit concerned about whether or not
this is what you really want.
3905595	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What do you mean?
3905596	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Correct me if I'm wrong	 but you seem
trapped.
3905597	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	It's as if everything you do is based on if
you think it will help your family business.
3905598	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm not forcing myself to.
3905599	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It is true that I take my family's company
into account when making decisions	 but...
3905600	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's because I personally believe doing so
is for the best.
3905601	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Tanemura-san...
3905630	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I feel that Riko-san is under excessive
pressure as Umetane's successor.
3905631	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	It's both wonderful and important to study
hard and help one's family	 but...
3905632	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Right now	 it seems she has no space
to decompress.
3905633	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	......
3905634	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	School is a time for kids to broaden their
horizons and find themselves.
3905635	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	So I'd like to ask you to consider letting
your daughter follow her heart.
3905636	AAAAAA==	I agree with your sentiment	 however	 that
time for Riko has long since passed.
3905637	AAAAAA==	I do not push her in the least. I support
what she wants to do.
3905638	AAAAAA==	Right	 Riko?
3905639	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes... As your only child	 it is my duty to
inherit Umetane...
3905640	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I mean	 I believe it is the best path for
me. This is what I want	 Ms. Katayama.
3905641	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	*gasp*
3905642	AAAAAA==	If we've reached an understanding	 then
please be on your way.
3905643	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	But Riko-san is...!
3905644	AAAAAA==	Meddling in family affairs is prohibited.
3905680	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I remember that day.
3905681	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	These are Ms. Katayama's memories.
Right	 Cattle?
3905682	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. These moments must have had a deep
impact on her.
3905683	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They also show that Katayama harbors a
strong desire to support and protect
her students.
3905685	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 Katayama-san's an amazing teacher!
3905686	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But from what we've just seen	 her desire is
being condemned	 forbidden	 and warped.
3905687	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's possible her heart is starting to
abandon it.
3905688	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Bein' supportive of your students is a
good thing! Why is she getting flack
for that!?
3905689	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Isn't that exactly what's going on at school
right now?
3905690	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Akashi's consulting has made the teachers
ignore the students and overwork Riko-senpai.
3905691	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If you really think about it	 it's more like
Akashi stole Katayama-san's desire	 huh?
3905692	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wait	 so is this Akashi's Palace after all!?
3905693	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Based on the collective unconscious	
we thought this was Katayama's Palace	 but...
3905694	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps there has been a mix-up. Something
certainly feels amiss.
3905695	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's investigate further and get to the
bottom of this.
3905696	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	If Ms. Katayama's desire is to support
her students...
3905697	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Then the one who denied that is...
3905750	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? What is this place?
3905751	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Looks like we're outside.
3905752	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is less than ideal. There are few
places to hide.
3905753	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd like to avoid a battle while Riko
Tanemura is with us. We should search for
another route.
3905755	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	True. I bet that Pseudo-Akashi is gone by
now	 so if we head back the way we came...
3905756	???	Tanemura-san?
3905757	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Huh?
3905758	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that... Ms. Katayama!?
3905759	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's her Shadow!
3905760	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's... a Shadow?
3905761	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The ruler appears at last. I would rather
avoid a fight with Tanemura here	 but...!
3905762	AAAAAA==	Tanemura-san... Why are you here?
3905763	AAAAAA==	It's too dangerous... Turn back... Hurry...
3905765	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Right! Stand at the ready!
3905766	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She's not going to attack us	 is she?
3905767	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't think so. If anything	 she seems
worried about us.
3905768	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She's not like Kiuchi and Miyazawa at all.
If we try talking to her	 she might just give
us her Treasure.
3905769	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sensei	 we want to help you.
3905770	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Please	 tell us why this Palace exists!
3905771	AAAAAA==	Wait... Are you all‚Äî

3905773	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wh-What's going on...!?
3905774	AAAAAA==	It's no use! Get out now.
It's too... dangerous.
3905775	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sensei?
3905776	AAAAAA==	Just leave... Hurry...
3905777	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You okay	 Sensei!?

3905781	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Agh! Please	 stop! We don't wanna hurt you!
3905782	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Her twisted desires are running wild! If we
let our guard down	 we're done for!
3905783	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't allow ourselves to lose here! We'll
have to deal some damage to her!
3905784	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's really no other choice?
I'm sorry	 Sensei!
3905850	AAAAAA==	No... Stop it... I don't want to fight...
3905785	AAAAAA==	Ngh...
3905786	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Her power is intensifying! She must be
planning something!
3905787	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san! Please	 listen to us!
3905788	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh? Katayama's Shadow is acting strange.
3905851	AAAAAA==	I refuse to...hurt my students!
3905852	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sensei...?
3905853	AAAAAA==	Argh!
3905854	AAAAAA==	Aaaaaaaaagh!
3905855	AAAAAA==	Please! Run!
3905890	AAAAAA==	Nghhh... No...! I don't want to...
hurt anyone!
3905891	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's going on? She's crying out to stop
the fight? She looks like she's in agony...
3905892	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Did you see that light sparking around her
just now?
3905893	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Focus! Katayama is only getting stronger!
<color=#FF423F>Defend</color> yourselves!
3905894	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's that light again!
3905895	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that electricity controlling her!?
3905896	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Katayama's Shadow is charged with even more
power than before! Brace
yourselves	 everyone!
3905950	AAAAAA==	Please	 no more! I'm begging you!
3905951	AAAAAA==	Aaaaagh!
3905952	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's going on!? Ms. Katayama's in so
much pain!
3905953	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sensei	 Listen! You don't wanna fight either	
right? Let's all calm down!
3905954	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	*gasp* Everyone	 up there!
3905955	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3905956	AAAAAA==	Aaaagh!
3905957	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is that Akashi!?
3905958	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But why? Isn't that Ms. Katayama's
own cognition?
3905959	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why would it attack her!?
3905960	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait... That's it. At last I understand!
3905961	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Akashi and Katayama both rule this Palace!
3905962	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What!? What does that mean!?
3905964	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. I was uncertain at first because of
Akashi's weak aura	 but...
3905965	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no mistake. They possess the will of
two distinct human beings.
3905966	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not a question of who is the cognition
of who...
3905967	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They are both individual Shadows!
3905968	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Two rulers in one Palace? Is that
even possible!?
3905969	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I am shocked as well. I never imagined such
a phenomenon would occur.
3905970	AAAAAA==	What do you think you're doing	 Ms. Katayama?
It's your job to eliminate intruders.
3905971	AAAAAA==	No! Please... I can't...hurt my students!
3905972	AAAAAA==	A bit late for that	 isn't it!?
3905973	AAAAAA==	Come on	 you're the violent Ms. K of
K Academy! Now give those kids a good beating!
3905974	AAAAAA==	No... You're wrong! I‚Äî
3905975	AAAAAA==	You'll never be allowed to return to school
again. And now you can't even punish the
students like the Menace you are?
3905976	AAAAAA==	You are completely worthless!
3905977	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ngh!
3905978	AAAAAA==	I'll give you a hand	 so at least try to
serve as a good body shield!
3906000	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn it! What do we do now!?
3906001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Katayama's Shadow is already at death's
door. Another attack might put her life
at risk!
3906002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First let's take out the other Shadows!
3906003	AAAAAA==	I told you to run... Why won't you go? I'm
not even sure...what I'm doing anymore...
3906004	AAAAAA==	Please	 get away from me... I might... I'm‚Äî
3906005	AAAAAA==	Must punish... bad students!
3906006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	She's focused her aim on one of us! Keep
your guard up and defend yourselves!
3906007	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I won't attack Katayama-san! She's just
being controlled by that bastard!
3906008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Like Cattle said	 let's deal with the other
Shadows first!
3906009	AAAAAA==	No... Stop it... I can't punish them...
I won't hurt my students!
3906050	AAAAAA==	*sigh* You really are useless! But exploiting
that incompetence...
3906051	AAAAAA==	...is part of my consulting expertise!
3906052	AAAAAA==	Aaaagh!
3906053	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn it! Get down here	 you little
chickenshit!
3906054	AAAAAA==	Hahaha! I prefer to let others handle my
dirty work.
3906055	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you like to pass the buck? That's just
like the real Akashi!
3906056	AAAAAA==	Please...
3906057	AAAAAA==	Kill...me...
3906058	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What!?
3906060	AAAAAA==	My body...won't listen to me...
3906061	AAAAAA==	I don't want...to hurt you!
3906062	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	W-We could never do that to you!
3906063	AAAAAA==	*sigh* What's with all the melodrama?
What kind of sappy soap is this?
3906064	AAAAAA==	Oh	 here's a pitch! Let's play "Who looks
weakest?" I spy a young lady in uniform.
3906065	AAAAAA==	My	 if it isn't Tanemura-san! Tsk tsk...
A blueblood should know better than
to trespass!
3906066	AAAAAA==	Now	 give Tanemura-san a swift bashing!
You can handle that much	 can't you?
3906067	AAAAAA==	Wha‚Äî!?
3906068	AAAAAA==	I am such a considerate consultant!
3906069	AAAAAA==	No! Stop! I don't want to!
3906070	AAAAAA==	Aaaagh!
3906072	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Enough!
3906073	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Stop resisting	 Sensei!
3906074	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	If you're in pain	 then hit me. It's simple!
3906075	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why fight it this much!?
3906076	AAAAAA==	I could...never do that!
3906077	AAAAAA==	You're my...precious student...
3906078	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm just one of hundreds	 aren't I?
3906079	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Don't carry on the teacher act even inside
your own heart. Just hit me and stop
suffering	 Ms. Katayama!
3906080	AAAAAA==	No... I'm not forcing myself to act like
a teacher.
3906081	AAAAAA==	I really want to be a proper one.
3906082	AAAAAA==	Someone who's always there to listen and
help the students...
3906083	AAAAAA==	But I'm a terrible	 selfish	 unfair teacher.
I'm sorry. I'm so	 so sorry...
3906084	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sensei!
3906085	AAAAAA==	I don't want... to lose... myself. I will
never... betray... my students.
3906086	AAAAAA==	Whatever happens... I want to stay... your
teacher... until the very end!
3906087	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	*gasp*
3906088	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why? Even though I pushed you away...
3906089	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why do you keep reaching out to me? Why do
you put yourself at risk to protect me?
3906090	AAAAAA==	Hahaha	 this really is a soap opera!
3906091	AAAAAA==	Mushy school stories about passionate
teachers get terrible ratings these days!
3906092	AAAAAA==	The masses want to see a hot-headed teacher
who talks with their fists. Now...
3906093	AAAAAA==	If you want to prove you're not useless	
then play the role expected of you!
3906130	AAAAAA==	Look	 Dad! I got a 90 on my test!
3906131	AAAAAA==	90... Did anyone get 100?
3906132	AAAAAA==	I think so...
3906133	AAAAAA==	I see. Then study harder to be number one
next time.
3906134	AAAAAA==	Wha... 
3906135	AAAAAA==	You will inherit Umetane's legacy one day.
And leaders do not show weakness.
3906136	AAAAAA==	Devote yourself to achieving consistent
grades that won't bring embarrassment on our
name. Understood?
3906137	AAAAAA==	...Understood.
3906138	AAAAAA==	I was only nice to you because you're the
president's daughter.
3906139	AAAAAA==	Haha... Do you honestly think people love
you for you?
3906140	AAAAAA==	If you weren't the heir to Umetane	 no one
would even look at you!
3906141	AAAAAA==	People are only kind to me because I'm the
heir to Umetane.
3906142	AAAAAA==	If I want to be treated with respect	 I have
to become worthy of my title.
3906143	AAAAAA==	If I want to be loved... No.
3906144	AAAAAA==	There is no love for me in this world. I have
to give up on it.
3906145	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Honor student. Worthy heir.
3906146	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The perfect daughter my parents want.
3906147	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'll keep playing the role expected of me.
3906200	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Play the role expected of you?
3906201	AAAAAA==	Huh?
3906202	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	How stupid...
3906203	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I've had someone who loves me for me
all along!
3906204	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	She was always reaching out to me	 but I
just kept...
3906205	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	...pushing her away!
3906206	AAAAAA==	You're wrong...
3906207	AAAAAA==	I wasn't able to earn your trust. We adults
are to blame.
3906208	AAAAAA==	A child's only job... is to receive love.
3906209	AAAAAA==	Your parents... and I... failed to give
that to you.
3906210	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No	 Sensei. I'm the one who gave up on
trusting anyone.
3906211	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I told myself that if love meant risking
rejection	 then I didn't need it.
3906212	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I shut myself off from it altogether. But...
3906213	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Unconditional love was always right there
in front of me!
3906214	AAAAAA==	Tanemura-san...
3906215	AAAAAA==	Ugh! I told you people	 that saccharine
sitcom schtick will only bore viewers
to tears.
3906216	AAAAAA==	Wait... Don't tell me... You really hoped
someone would love you?
3906217	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	......
3906218	AAAAAA==	Ahahahaha! Don't be absurd! Love and rich
girls are like oil and water! You really
are a fool!
3906219	AAAAAA==	You'll never have love. After all	 every
single person in your life...
3906220	AAAAAA==	...is only after Umetane's wealth and
influence!
3906221	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	How dare you!
3906222	AAAAAA==	Ah	 but if it's words of love you want to
hear	 I'm happy to oblige.
3906223	AAAAAA==	I looove you	 Tanemura-san! What a talented
young lady you are!
3906224	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Shut up.
3906225	AAAAAA==	...Huh?
3906226	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I said shut up. Your empty words repulse me.
3906227	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You are a lying coward...
3906228	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	...whose only talents are treachery and
exploitation!
3906229	AAAAAA==	What the‚Äî!?
3906230	AAAAAA==	Wh-Wh-What are you lackeys waiting for!?
Dispose of them!
3906270	AAAAAA==	Watch out!
3906271	AAAAAA==	Ngh‚Äî!
3906272	AAAAAA==	Please... run! I can't... fight it!
3906273	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
3906274	Motoha Arai	But...!
3906275	Motoha Arai	AAAAAA==
3906276	Lufel	We can't let ourselves be done in! We have
no choice but to defeat Kumi Katayama's
Shadow.
3906277	Shun Kano	But...!
3906278	Riko Tanemura	It's all right.
3906279	AAAAAA==	Hahahah. Now you're finished!
3906280	AAAAAA==	Stop it...!
3906281	Riko Tanemura	AAAAAA==
3906282	Lufel	Ngh‚Äî!
3906283	Lufel	Is that...?
3906284	Riko Tanemura	You... Just as I thought.
3906285	Riko Tanemura	I understand now.
3906286	Riko Tanemura	Ms. Katayama	 I won't give up anymore.
3906287	Riko Tanemura	I will save you. I promise.
3906288	Riko Tanemura	You! The monster that exploited my teacher's
love for her students‚ÄîKei Akashi! I will
take back everything you've stolen!
3906289	AAAAAA==	Wha‚Äî!?
3906290	Chiyome	I shall see that resolve carried out.
3906291	Chiyome	Should you reach out to take hold of that
which you feared	 relinquished	
and abandoned...
3906292	Chiyome	...the path ahead will prove tempestuous.
But I presume you are well aware.
3906293	Chiyome	Now soar ahead	 heedless of the muck and
dark isolation that surround you...
3906294	Chiyome	Reclaim that desire called Love!
3906340	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! I can't believe Riko-senpai has
a Persona!
3906295	Chiyome	Come... Let us race through fields and
forests	 and dance across the sky!
3906296	Chiyome	For I am thou...
3906297	Riko Tanemura	...And thou art... I!
3906298	Motoha Arai	She's flying!?
3906299	Shun Kano	Is that... a Persona?
3906300	Lufel	It would seem so. But I've never seen one
like it before!
3906301	Riko Tanemura	See it through	 <color=#72C5FF>Chiyome</color>!
3906302	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
3906303	Motoha Arai	Incredible...
3906304	Shun Kano	Katayama-san!
3906305	AAAAAA==	Wh-Wh-What're you gawking at!? Grab that
useless teacher!
3906306	AAAAAA==	The rest of you	 take care of these
intruders! Hop to it!
3906307	Riko Tanemura	Everyone ready?
3906308	Riko Tanemura	It's time for a counterattack.
3906341	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I apologize for the wait. This one's
abilities seem quite invaluable.
3906342	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no time to talk! This Shadow is
incredibly strong!
3906344	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Leave it to me. I will be the wind at
your backs!
3906370	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew! Managed to pull through somehow.
3906371	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But Akashi took Katayama-san. We gotta
save her ASAP!
3906372	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes	 we should hurry...
3906373	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Uh...
3906374	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you okay	 Riko-senpai!?
3906375	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	She's exhausted from her Persona awakening.
3906376	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's prioritize returning to the real world
to let Riko Tanemura rest.
3906377	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Shadows are on high alert now anyway.
3906378	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But what about Ms. Katayama!?
3906380	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	He's right. We only made it through that last
battle thanks to you	 Senpai.
3906381	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You must be wiped. You can lean on my
shoulder if you need.
3906382	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 no	 no. I'll do it!
3906383	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Why?
3906384	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 a) Riko-senpai is a girl	 and
b) you're kinda ham-fisted	 Soy.
3906385	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ham-fisted!?
3906387	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But did Motoha not say she was concerned
as a fellow girl?
3906388	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Piggyback!? Um	 no. Veto! If anyone's going
to do it	 it'll be me!
3906389	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In your arms!? Oh	 but I guess Wonder would
be gentle... probably?
3906390	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Why does that feel like a dig at me?
3906391	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 don't worry. I can walk just fine.
3906392	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	However	 I would like a safe place to stop
and catch my breath if possible.
3906393	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You got it! Let's get back to the real world	
Wonder!
3906450	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know I've said this already	 but I can't
believe you have a Persona too	 Senpai!
3906451	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Persona... So that's what they're called.
3906452	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It feels like Chiyome was always watching
over me	 even in the Metaverse...
3906453	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Even before you fully awakened to her	 she
was still giving you support.
3906455	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've been curious about this for quite some
time. In this world of withering desire...
3906456	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...not only did Tanemura stir us to
investigate Akashi	 she also put herself at
great personal risk doing so.
3906457	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That is likely when your potential desire
bloomed and your Persona partially awakened.
3906458	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That voice... Cattle?
3906459	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Correct. In the real world	 my name is Lufel.
This form is quite modish	 wouldn't you say?
3906460	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I see. Then the voice I heard came from the
owl hiding in {NAME1}-kun's bag...
3906461	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Perhaps I heard you in the caf√© because I
was starting to awaken.
3906462	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's quite probably the case.
3906463	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By the way	 my owl form is quite modish	
don't you think?
3906464	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Didn't you just ask that?
3906465	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I bet he wants you to say	 "Yes!
Very modish!"
3906466	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 what an avaricious little owl. But I
would say it's more soign√©	 wouldn't
you agree?
3906467	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! Finally	 someone who gets it!
3906468	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Swan... Yay?
3906469	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	In modern terms	 it means stylish. Something
that is simple yet elegant.
3906470	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	First time I heard of it...
3906471	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes! Finally! Someone who understands what
I'm talking about! Aren't Motoha and Shun
utterly exasperating!?
3906473	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What!? No way! I thought you had our
backs	 {NAME2}!
3906474	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	T-Traitor!
3906475	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Y-Yeah! He can't expect the average
high schooler to understand such hard words!
3906476	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Exactly! Wait	 why are you looking at me!?
3906477	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 this is the part where you agree!
3906478	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe. I'm sorry to interrupt your
conversation	 but...
3906479	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm starting to feel the day's exhaustion
catching up with me. I'd like to get home
and lay down.
3906480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh right	 my apologies. We came back here
so you could rest.
3906481	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! I'll walk you home!
3906482	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's all right	 I'll call a car. Thank you	
Motoha.
3906483	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Well then	 I'll see you all at school.
Let's talk more then.
3906484	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 we should all retire as well.
Get some well-earned rest	 everyone.
3906520	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm glad Tanemura got home safe. Now	 we
ought to retire as well.
3906560	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Apologies for the lateness of the hour.
3906561	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have disturbed your precious sleep at the
behest of my master who wishes a word.
3906563	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Ah	 do not be alarmed. I simply hope to speak
with you as usual.
3906564	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	So	 without further delay... There is a
particular question I would like you
to answer.
3906565	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	I understand there exist two ways...
3906566	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	...for hopeless individuals to rejuvenate
their withered desire.
3906567	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	One can spend years interacting with others	
fumbling to grasp at just a little...
3906568	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Or...
3906569	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	They can amass indomitable influence to
manipulate and consume the desires of others.
3906570	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Which do you... No. Let me ask you
this way...
3906571	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	If it were you	 which method would
you chose?
3906573	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	*chuckle* As I expected.
3906574	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Oh? *chuckle* What an uncharacteristic
response.
3906575	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	*chuckle* I see. Is that how you feel...
3906576	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	These methods both have the power to
drive desire.
3906577	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	But if either seeks supremacy...
3906578	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	...an inevitable battle with ensue.
3906579	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Regarding your efforts to strengthen
your desire	 please be aware my master values
the achievements you have made thus far.
3906580	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	*chuckle* Now	 I wish to discuss
this"mastermind" you all speak of.
3906582	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	Well	 as I have said	 we cannot grant you
the answers you seek on this journey.
3906583	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	To escape imminent ruin...
you must remain on the winning side.
3906584	I<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>or	That fact... is ever constant.
3906650	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I see. So	 the confessions from Kiuchi
and Hiromu Miyazawa were a result
of your "work."
3906651	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. Now our next targets are Katayama
and Akashi.
3906652	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But why do they both have a Palace in the
same place?
3906653	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Kiuchi and Miyazawa's were in separate areas.
3906654	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To be more precise	 the two of them exist as
the rulers of one Palace.
3906655	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A single Palace co-ruled by both of them.
A "Joint Palace	 if you will.
3906656,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,A Joint Palace? Why the heck did that happen?
3906657,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Why indeed. Well, my thoughts are...
3906658,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Firstly, I believe the fact that Akashi and
Katayama are connected in the real world is
a large part of it.
3906659,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,So in the Metaverse, that toxic connection
entangled their twisted desires as their
Shadows began clashing.
3906660,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,In short, their negative emotions have
synergized, amplifying one another's
twisted desires.
3906661,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Those melded desires most likely resulted
in a Joint Palace.
3906662,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Ms. Katayama lost control of herself and her
desire because Akashi put her in a corner.
3906663,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,However, that was his intention. His
provocations sent her into a downward spiral.
3906664,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Then the Palace came about. That was likely
part of his scheme as well.
3906666,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I've mentioned before that Akashi was
formerly a business consultant, right?
3906667,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Well, I did some digging into the companies
he worked with.
3906668,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,The company culture improved once that
meticulous old-timer finally hit the bricks."
3906669	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm glad that useless daydreamer
got canned.
3906670	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There is always an obvious villain.
3906671	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 what	 a seasoned veteran can't
have opinions!?
3906672	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	People SHOULD talk about their dreams!
3906673	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes	 I agree.
3906674	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Employees are not a hive mind. Firing
someone just because you don't agree with
them is... odd.
3906675	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	A real consultant doesn't place blame. They
fix inefficiency and unfair practices.
3906676	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Even if an employee is an ill fit for a team	
it's better for everyone to cooperate and
aim for success together.
3906677	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	However... Akashi's success stories almost
always revolve around a "villain."
3906678	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Getting rid of them makes management look
proactive	 and Akashi receives all
the credit.
3906679	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you mean he...!
3906681	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's my guess. Even so...
3906682	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	They're not exactly false accusations. Every
company has its share of bad apples
after all.
3906683	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But this number of long-time	 dedicated
employees suddenly being incriminated right
after Akashi arrives...
3906684	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	...is too high to be plausible.
3906685	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You mean to say Akashi was actively sowing
the seeds of discord at these companies?
3906686	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There's something else too. Take a look
at this...
3906687	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Divine Justice? That's the "Hit-and-Run
Rider" everyone's talking about.
3906688	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The Hit-and-Run Rider is... Ms. Katayama.
3906689	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What!?
3906690	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I found this video on Akashi's computer.
3906691	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	She changes into a delivery uniform in a
public bathroom	 then races off on a bicycle.
3906692	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way... This can't be real.
3906693	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Unfortunately	 it's the truth. This video
also means...
3906694	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Akashi already knew Ms. Katayama was the
Hit-and-Run Rider.
3906695	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	He knew she'd be an easy target to make into
a Menace and fill his villain role.
3906696	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's why he started shit with her? So she'd
be labeled violent!?
3906697	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And he's trying to get her fired just so he
can look like some great consultant!
3906698	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's right. Also	 I assume Akashi wears
smart glasses as a means to catch his
villains in the act.
3906699	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Once he gets them on tape	 it becomes
impossible for them to escape accusation.
3906700	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And I said before	 many of his victims have
suffered severe emotional dysregulation...
and even lost their lives.
3906701	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then if Akashi is stealing Katayama's
desires away...
3906702	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She might end up the same!?
3906703	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I can't say for sure.
3906704	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	But if we ignore Akashi	 more people will
fall victim.
3906705	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	While the police stay totally oblivious...
3906706	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And that bastard keeps sacrificing good
people like Ms. Katayama for his own gain!
3906709	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh?
3906710	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah! {NAME2} got hit once on
the train!
3906711	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So that behavior was going on long before
Akashi came into the picture.
3906712	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Which means he can't be the cause of
Ms. Katayama's reckless cycling habit.
3906713	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah... I guess you're right...
3906714	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yamagoshi-san and Masa-san told us she used
to ride her bike for hours whenever she
got upset.
3906715	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I get that it must clear her head	 but
terrorizing the neighborhood is not
so great	 huh...
3906716	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama probably rides to release her
pent-up stress from school.
3906717	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And I am surely one source of that
frustration.
3906719	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You guys aren't the only ones at fault.
I used to be kinda scared of her	 and it
probably showed...
3906720	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... I worried her constantly and didn't
ask for help when I needed it.
3906722	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I understand how you all feel	 but can we
return to the topic at hand?
3906723	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We are the only ones who can stop Akashi
and Katayama's Shadows from running amuck
after all.
3906724	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're right. Thank you	 Lufel. Now	 to
continue explaining my thoughts...
3906725	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama's Palace is a dam	 correct?
3906726	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I thought it was 'cause she used to
ride her bike there like Masa-san said.
3906727	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That is one possibility... But something
occurred to me as Lufel spoke just now.
3906728	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What if the dam symbolizes the relationship
between the two rulers?
3906729	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Their relationship?
3906730	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama's stifled frustration or	 rage
really	 which she can only release
on her bike...
3906731	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	In a way	 Akashi is feeding off of it to
improve his own station.
3906732	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the dam turns Katayama's wrath into
energy	 which Akashi absorbs?
3906733	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah! When we first saw him	 he stuck a
cable into the ground to heal himself!
3906734	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then he's leeching off the dam's energy!?
No... He's leeching off Katayama-san's heart!
3906736	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes. Moreover	 Akashi's password was the key
to that door in the Palace.
3906737	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So	 between their two Shadows	 he seems to
be the one in charge.
3906738	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	In other words	 the dam is under his control	
and Ms. Katayama is just being
exploited by him.
3906739	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa!
3906740	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shit! Before he started leechin'	 he wasn't
even a speck on Lufel's radar!
3906741	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 his presence was weaker than the
Shadows in Mementos.
3906742	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Really? Then...
3906743	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Perhaps rather than controlling her	 he's
more like a parasite.
3906744	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That makes way more sense! I can't picture
Ms. Katayama being controlled by anyone!
3906745	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 to summarize...
3906746	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As long as Akashi continues to absorb
Katayama's energy	 his Shadow is invincible.
3906747	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This means we can't steal Akashi's Treasure.
We will need to cut off his source of
power first.
3906748	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But to do that	 we'll need to steal
Katayama's Treasure and invoke a change
of heart.
3906749	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Change Katayama-san's heart...?
3906750	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Honestly	 Akashi aside	 I never believed
Katayama-san could be a Palace ruler.
3906751	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If she's got repressed anger she can only
let out by pullin' risky stunts in secret...
3906752	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	...then I wanna free her from that. That way
I can at least sorta pay her back
for everythin'.
3906753	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Don't put this all on yourself	 Kano-kun.
3906754	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I played no small part in Ms. Katayama's
desires getting twisted.
3906755	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Until going into her Palace and seeing who
she really is	 I didn't trust Ms. Katayama...
3906756	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But she truly cares for all of her students.
We can't let that creep treat her like an
energy drink anymore. Right	 {NAME2}?
3906758	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I concur. Well	 that gives us a
unanimous decision.
3906759	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Our target is clear	 so our next objective is
to secure a route to her Treasure.
3906760	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right. Let's head back to the Palace and
sniff it out.
3906761	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Oh	 but first...
3906762	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There's something I'd like to do before we
return to the Palace.
3906800	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We're here.
3906801	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	H-Hold on! Are we really going in there	
Riko-senpai!?
3906802	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama often comes here to drink.
Another tidbit from Akashi's surveillance.
3906803	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And we can't meet her at school because
she's suspended	 remember?
3906804	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But	 we're minors. Won't we get arrested
or somethin'?
3906805	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Don't worry	 it's not like we're going to
order drinks. Besides...
3906806	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I can just say the disciplinary committee is
here to check for errant students.
3906808	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yep	 that's our Riko-senpai.
3906809	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Let's head in.
3906810	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	I knew it. It's that kid with the owl... But
what are they doing going into a bar?
3906811	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	There's another person with them too...
3906812	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Could they be...?
3906850	AAAAAA==	Welcome! Oh my	 quite the young folks	
aren't you?
3906851	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Don't worry	 we won't drink. We'll... just be
a few minutes.
3906852	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama.
3906853	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Hm?
3906854	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Huh!? Wha‚Äî? Tanemura-san!? Where'd you all
come from!?
3906855	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	You're minors! What are you doing here!?
3906856	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We can't meet at school since the suspension	
so we came to you instead.
3906857	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	S-Still... You shouldn't be here.
3906858	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	First let me say...
3906859	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm sorry	 Sensei.
3906860	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Huh? Wait	 for what?
3906861	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ever since I was a first-year	 you've always
reached out to me. And yet...
3906862	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I convinced myself that you didn't really
care	 and treated you coldly because of it.
3906863	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I remember the cruel things I said to you...
Calling you overbearing...
3906864	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Tanemura-san...?
3906865	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	This is long overdue	 but the truth is	
I was happy.
3906866	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Or rather	 I never appreciated how happy your
concern made me until now.
3906867	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You always gave me everything I had
abandoned. All of the support and care...
3906868	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Haha	 what on earth's gotten into you?
3906869	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'm sure it's hard to believe. After all	 I
never let myself trust you	 Sensei.
3906870	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's why	 even if you're not convinced	
I won't give up on you.
3906871	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Just as you never gave up on me...
3906872	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Oh	 Tanemura-san...
3906873	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I believe you. Of course I believe you.
3906874	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I'm not sure what happened	 but I'm so happy
to hear you say that. Thank you...
3906875	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	But I can't be your teacher anymore.
3906876	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I'm a Menace on indefinite suspension.
3906877	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	And more than anything else	 I'm just...
so... tired.
3906878	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ms. Katayama...
3906879	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Oh that's right. You are the
Hit-and-Run Rider	 after all.
3906880	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What!? How do you know about that!?
3906881	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Senpai! Not here...!
3906882	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	How shameful. A teacher should set a good
example. Not go on reckless joyrides.
3906883	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The disciplinary committee can't ignore this.
3906884	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I-I'm sorry. I...
3906885	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Therefore	 I'm going to steal your warped
desires away from you.
3906886	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Huh?
3906887	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I'll put you back on the straight and narrow!
3906888	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	What does that mean...?
3906889	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So... Please come back to school soon!
3906890	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ms. Katayama!
3906891	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm sorry too! You were worried about me	 but
I just acted like a brat and made
things worse.
3906892	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I really rely on and look up to you
so much! Like	 a lot!
3906893	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Kano-kun...
3906894	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Things aren't right without you at school.
It's too weird!
3906895	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're our homeroom teacher! Please come back
to school soon!
3906896	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Arai-san...
3906898	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	{NAME1}-kun...
3906899	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Hooky? Haha...
3906900	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Thank you... for accepting a pathetic teacher
like me.
3906901	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	*sob*
3906902	AAAAAA==	Oh my... You've been blessed with such
wonderful students	 Kumi-chan.
3906950	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Head straight home	 okay? And be careful.
3906951	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes	 Sensei!
3906952	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Um...
3906953	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Hm? What is it	 Kano-kun?
3906954	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 I just gotta ask... Why'd you start
riding crazy on your bike?
3906955	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	That's always been my form of stress relief.
When I hit those pedals	 I can
forget everything.
3906956	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	But even though it always felt great in the
past... Lately	 for some reason...
3906957	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	My body suddenly heats up	 and I feel like I
can't control myself.
3906958	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ms. Katayama...
3906959	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	After all these years	 I'm still the same
wild	 hot-headed delinquent.
3906960	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	I need to grow up already. I want to
apologize to everyone I hurt.
3906961	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Thanks for coming to see me today. I've got
some self-reflecting to do.
3906962	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
3906963	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's wrong	 Lufel?
3906964	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yeah... I mean	 no.
3906965	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In Katayama's inner world	 she absolutely
refused to strike her students at the cost
of her own safety.
3906966	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's incomprehensible how one of such mental
fortitude could surrender to blind rage.
3906967	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do ya mean?
3906968	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 I have no conclusive evidence.
Forget I mentioned it.
3906969	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyways	 Katayama-san's warped desire is
better now	 right?
3906970	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I wonder if her Palace is gone.
3906971	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's not likely. If Katayama were the
sole ruler	 perhaps...
3906972	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But that Palace represents the convergence
of two individual's desires	 with Akashi's
Shadow acting as a parasite.
3906973	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still... the Palace itself has likely
changed. Once we've made our preparations	
let's put our plan in motion.
3906975	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Well	 we should head home. Let's walk to the
station together to avoid getting distracted
with unnecessary pitstops.
3906976	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha! Never change	 Riko-senpai!
3906977	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Girl	Metaverse...? Palace...?
3907000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 what's the plan for today? I would like
to check on Katayama's Palace	 but...
3906978	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	Honestly	 I don't even remember crashing
through the train like it said on
Divine Justice.
3906979	Kumi Katay<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ma	B-But there's photo evidence everywhere	 so
I shouldn't be making excuses. I'm sorry.
3907001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's up to your judgement	 Leader.
3907030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey guys	 we've been using Riko-senpai's
real name here	 but...
3907031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Isn't she a Phantom Thief now?
3907032	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I would hope so	 but... Is it all right with
our leader?
3907034	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Thank you. It's an honor to work together.
3907035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The honor is ours. In addition to proving
yourself more than capable in battle	
you also possess a sharp intellect.
3907036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How would you like to act as the
Phantom Thieves' brain and chief strategist?
3907037	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh yeah	 we could use one of those.
3907038	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ooh	 Chief Strategist? That sounds so cool!
We're startin' to seem pretty legit	 huh?
3907039	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Strategist? Am I really qualified for that?
3907040	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're the only one qualified	 Riko-senpai!
You've got my vote!
3907041	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Not like your vote counts for much	 Closer.
3907042	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That would be hurtful coming from anyone
but you	 Soy.
3907043	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 very well. I'll assume the role of the
Phantom Thieves' Chief Strategist.
3907044	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	On that note	 everyone calls each other by
code names here	 like "Closer" and
Soy, right?
3907045	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah	 I forgot! You haven't picked a
code name yet!
3907046	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Wonder	 Cattle	 Closer	 Soy... How did you
all decide on your names?
3907047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We each chose something we think is strange
or mysterious.
3907048	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anythin' come to mind	 Senpai?
3907049	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Something mysterious? Let's see...
3907050	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What about "Wind"?
3907051	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wind? Ooh	 I love it!
3907052	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But what is it you find mysterious
about wind?
3907053	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I've always wondered why the word for
disciplinary committee uses the kanji
for wind.
3907054	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The same character appears in many words
relating to the core values of a culture or
the characteristics of a region.
3907055	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Is that because it pertains to the feeling
or "air" of a particular locality? It's hard
to be sure.
3907056	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh... Smart people think about the
weirdest things.
3907058	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Is it really that weird? Well... I haven't
done any proper research or anything. It just
struck me as odd.
3907059	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What does wink have to do with anything?
Other than kind of rhyming...
3907060	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hmmm... Wink doesn't feel all that
mysterious.
3907061	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And with a code name like that	 it sounds
like you just blink a lot.
3907062	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wind is a great name! It's light	 refreshing	
and fits you to a T!
3907063	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It matches your Persona too!
3907064	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes... Taking Chiyome's abilities into
account	 I believe I could serve best in a
support role.
3907065	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I wish to be the wind at my allies' backs
and a cyclone against my foes.
3907066	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent. Then you'll henceforth be known
as "Wind."
3907067	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 should we call you Wind-senpai in
the Metaverse?
3907068	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You can drop "senpai." I'd like everyone to
speak to me casually going forward.
3907069	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	As a Phantom Thief	 I'm the newcomer here.
And as allies	 we're all equals	 are we not?
3907070	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 okay then! Welcome to the team	 Wind!
3907072	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes	 it's wonderful to work with you	
Wonder. Well then	 shall we be off?
3907120	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What the heck!? This place looks
totally different!
3907121	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The water level is lower!
3907122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems just as Wind surmised	 this Palace
is a dam powered by Katayama's anger.
3907123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which would make this reservoir a
manifestation of her wrath and other negative
emotions building up.
3907124	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So	 the dam is drying up now that we've
resolved those feelings in the real world?
3907125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. It's proof that your feelings
reached her.
3907126	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Thank goodness...
3907127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 let us hunt for the Treasure.
3907128	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmmm...
3907129	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Katayama's Treasure is surprisingly close.
I sense it in that direction.
3907130	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Looks like we can go that way now that the
water level is lower.
3907131	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san... We'll save you. Just hang on
a bit longer!
3907150	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should prioritize finding Katayama's
Treasure.
3907151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is no time to be checking every nook
and cranny	 Wonder.
3907170	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense the Treasure nearby...
And something else...
3907171	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	A powerful Shadow. It must be
Ms. Katayama...
3907172	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems the Treasure is higher above us.
Let's keep going upward.
3907230	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I feel it... The Treasure is here.
3907231	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	And... Ms. Katayama is too.
3907232	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama!
3907233	AAAAAA==	Tanemura-san	 I'm glad you're here.
3907234	AAAAAA==	And you three as well. Kano-kun	 Arai-san	
{NAME1}-kun...
3907235	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are you okay	 Katayama-san!? Wait...
3907236	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How'd you know it was us?
3907237	AAAAAA==	Of course I know. I'm your teacher after all.
3907238	AAAAAA==	You're here for this	 right?
3907240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's Ms. Katayama's Treasure!
3907241	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But how is it visible? We didn't send out a
calling card	 did we?
3907242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 how is it visible already? We didn't
even send out a calling card yet.
3907243	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A calling card's purpose is to alert the
person that their Treasure will be stolen.
3907244	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If I had to guess	 what Wind said to Katayama
in that bar...
3907245	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Therefore	 I'm going to steal your warped
desires away from you.
3907246	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It must have had the same effect as a
calling card.
3907247	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes...
3907248	AAAAAA==	You came for this	 didn't you?
3907249	AAAAAA==	It's dear to me	 but go on	 take it.
3907250	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Really!? You sure?
3907251	AAAAAA==	Yes	 it's fine.
3907252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But	 it's your most precious desire	
isn't it?
3907253	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If we steal it	 and the worst happens...
you might not want to be a teacher anymore.
3907254	AAAAAA==	This is a manga about a delinquent teacher
that was popular back in my day.
It's my Bible.
3907255	AAAAAA==	I was a wild child then	 but there was a
certain teacher that saved me from myself.
3907256	AAAAAA==	I admired them so much	 I aspired to be a
passionate teacher like that. Someone who
faces their students head-on.
3907257	AAAAAA==	Those feelings were real	 but...
3907258	AAAAAA==	Somewhere along the line	 I became hooked
on playing the hot-blooded teacher.
3907259	AAAAAA==	So I want to start over... Forget about
acting like a hero	 and actually try to
meet my students where they're at.
3907260	AAAAAA==	So go on	 take it.
3907261	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ms. Katayama...
3907262	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We can't disregard her feelings. Let's steal
it	 Wonder.
3907263	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama	 please	 wake up!
3907264	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why...? Why did this happen!?
3907265	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san... This can't be real...
3907266	{PLAYER_NAME}	All because that power was sent into her...
Now it's too...
3907267	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Nooooo!
3907268	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's wrong	 Wonder?
3907269	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't tell me...
3907270	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You "saw" something again	 didn't you?
3907271	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	...! This aura... It's...!
3907272	AAAAAA==	All right	 all right. That's enough! Wrap it
up	 Ms. Katayama!
3907273	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
3907274	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san!?
3907275	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
3907276	AAAAAA==	I already told you people. No one wants to
see your tearful coming-of-age drama.
3907289	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What the heck was that...!?
3907287	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Mr. Akashi...?
3907288	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	...Where?
3907277	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Show yourself	 Akashi! You... You coward!
3907278	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san! Hang on!
3907279	AAAAAA==	The people want violence! Shock value!
3907280	AAAAAA==	Ms. Violent Teacher's about to star in her
very own slaughter show!
3907281	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
3907282	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sensei... No...
3907283	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's happening to her!?
3907284	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He's forcing her Shadow to go berserk!
Everyone	 get ready!
3907285	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Akashi...
3907286	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	AKASHIII!
3907320	AAAAAA==	No... I won't hurt...my students...
3907290	AAAAAA==	Yes...
3907291	AAAAAA==	I am a violent teacher...
3907292	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Katayama's wrathful desires are being
amplified... That cable is injecting some
kind of power into her.
3907293	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Her wings... Are those eyes?
3907294	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Bastard! How could you do this to her!?
3907295	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 did that eyeball just get dimmer?
3907296	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	After it attacked us	 the light became
weaker... It seems to reflect her
remaining power level.
3907297	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm... As Katayama releases her wrath through
those attacks	 the light in the eyes grows
faint. However...
3907298	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	She will likely recover before too long.
If the light gets stronger	 her attacks will
likely intensify as well.
3907299	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems so. Let's keep that in mind.
3907321	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sensei...?
3907322	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Katayama's desire... Has the power of her
wrath subsided?
3907323	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then is she back to her old self!?
3907324	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san! Hey	 Katayama-san!
3907325	AAAAAA==	......
3907326	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	She's not attacking	 but I don't think she
hears us either.
3907327	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	She's suppressing her own desire. What
astounding mental fortitude!
3907328	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 I don't know how long she can
hold out. Let's take this chance to regroup!
3907360	AAAAAA==	Ugh	 come on already! What do you think
you're doing!? Kill them!
3907361	AAAAAA==	Unleash your rage! Let it burn!
3907362	AAAAAA==	No... Nooooo...!
3907363	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama!
3907364	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He's using that weird power on her again!
3907365	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This isn't good. He's amplifying her anger...
3907366	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If that surge of power persists	 Katayama's
mind won't survive!
3907367	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	One wrong move and she could be permanently
injured... She may even lose her life!
3907371	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Cut the power? You mean beat Akashi!?
3907372	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But he's hiding somewhere! How are we
supposed to stop him!?
3907373	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In that case... our only option is to cut
the cable.
3907374	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course! No matter how much we fight	
as long that energy source persists...
3907375	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Katayama's Shadow will be revived and forced
to do battle!
3907376	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we cut that cable	 we can free her from
Akashi's control!
3907377	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	No	 wait! Even if you cut it	 the cycle will
repeat if Akashi connects a new cable.
3907378	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then what do we do!?
3907379	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Give me time	 leader. I promise I'll find
a way to save Ms. Katayama!
3907381	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Okay! Just hold out for a little!
3907382	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	One order of Grade A stalling	 comin'
right up! Countin' on ya	 Wind!
3907383	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Please hold on	 Ms. Katayama...!
3907420	AAAAAA==	What!? Again!? Enough with the turtle act!
We all know you're a raging bull!
3907384	AAAAAA==	I... I	 I	 I...!
3907385	AAAAAA==	I'm useless...
3907386	AAAAAA==	Ah... Arghh... I... have to keep it together...
3907387	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That red light... This is bad! Her wrath has
reached its peak! Everyone	 get ready!
3907388	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 there's some kind of shield around
Ms. Katayama!
3907389	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems like she's trying to build up her
wrath while the shield is up...
3907390	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then we need to destroy that shield first!
3907421	AAAAAA==	Now let me see you stampede your students!
3907422	AAAAAA==	No... No	 no...! AAAAAAGH!
3907423	AAAAAA==	I'll never hurt my students... Never!
3907424	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sensei!
3907425	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Analysis... complete!
3907426	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Everyone	 look at the eyes on those wings!
They're absorbing power from the cable!
3907427	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Eyes!? Oh	 I see! If those are absorbing the
energy	 then...!
3907429	AAAAAA==	Got it!
3907470	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sensei!
3907430	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's one down!
3907431	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's just as Wind suspected. Katayama's power
is weakening. But...
3907432	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's still not enough. We can't let this
drag on too long.
3907433	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then let's finish this up quick	 then!
3907434	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Those <color=#FF423F>two eyes</color> closest to her haven't
really done anything up until now...
3907435	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's the connection point for the cable.
This is our opening!
3907436	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time to finish this!
3907437	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Ms. Katayama... I'm going to set you free!
3907471	AAAAAA==	Tch	 you're utterly useless! That person's
power turned out to be a disappointment	 too...
3907472	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That bastard!
3907473	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sensei! Can you hear me!? Sensei!
3907474	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's happening to her	 Cattle!?
3907475	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah... I think she'll be fine.
3907476	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That strange power which transformed her is
gone	 and she's no longer in a frenzy.
3907477	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If her Shadow disappears	 it should return
to the real Katayama.
3907478	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Really? She'll be okay	 right!?
3907479	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. Things could've been much worse if not
for Wonder and Wind's quick thinking.
3907480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But as it stands	 the real Katayama won't
suffer any ill repercussions.
3907481	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank goodness...
3907482	AAAAAA==	Everyone... I'm sorry...for everything...
3907483	AAAAAA==	You deserve...a better teacher...
3907484	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's not true!
3907485	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You're a wonderful teacher who protects all
of her students	 including me!
3907487	AAAAAA==	Thank you... I'm going to be better from
now on.
3907488	AAAAAA==	I promise to return to school... and to you	
my precious students.
3907489	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sensei...
3907490	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So this is Ms. Katayama's Treasure...
3907491	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn it. Katayama-san tried to hand it over
herself too.
3907492	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If Akashi hadn't shown up	 we wouldn't have
had to fight her!
3907493	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! And if we'd made even the tiniest
mistake	 she could've died!
3907494	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And that coward Akashi... Controlling her
while hiding himself away! I'll never
forgive him!
3907495	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Uh... What just happened?
3907496	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With Katayama's Shadow gone	 the dam must
be low on power.
3907497	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That explains the outage. Anyway	 let's head
after Aka-shit.
3907498	AAAAAA==	Warning. Dam energy supply depleted.
3907499	AAAAAA==	Initiating emergency protocol. All doors
will be locked in ten minutes.
3907500	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa	 whoa	 what!?
3907501	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All the doors... will lock in ten minutes?
3907503	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh! Akashi's Shadow is weak and can only
feed off other Shadows!
3907504	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Until he finds a new host to exploit	 he
plans to keep the Palace on lockdown!
3907505	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you mean?
3907506	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	In other words	 until Akashi finds another
victim to fill Ms. Katayama's place...
3907507	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We won't be able to enter the Palace or
steal Akashi's Treasure?
3907508	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely.
3907509	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What!? Then we gotta steal his Treasure
right now!
3907510	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! We have to change Akashi's heart
before more people get hurt!
3907511	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Calm down. That will be impossible to do in
only ten minutes.
3907512	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Akashi is crafty	 and he's already wary
of us. If we chase him blindly	 we might
end up walking into a trap.
3907513	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Besides	 if we don't escape now	 we'll be
trapped in this Palace forever.
3907515	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn...!
3907516	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That fuckin' scumbag! Way to bring
chickenshit to a new level!
3907517	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Should we at least bring back Sensei's
Treasure?
3907518	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 let's leave it here for now.
3907519	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Why!?
3907520	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Without her Treasure inside	 the Palace
may start to collapse.
3907521	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And if that happens	 we won't be able to
steal Akashi's Treasure.
3907522	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes... You're right. I know it's frustrating	
but let's retreat for now.
3907523	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Cattle	 if you don't mind.
3907524	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Understood!
3907525	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Sensei... I promise we'll come back for
your Treasure!
3907570	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank god. We managed to make it back
somehow.
3907571	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn that bastard Akashi!
3907572	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We had no choice. If we had allowed ourselves
to be trapped there...
3907573	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Any chance to change Akashi's heart would
have been lost	 and he would be left to
roam free forever.
3907574	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Besides	 it seems Katayama's Shadow has
found a new lease on life.
3907575	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not quite a change of heart	 but Akashi
can no longer steal her desire.
3907576	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That's true. Then shall we switch gears?
3907577	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Our next objective is to secure a route
to Akashi's Treasure	 but...
3907578	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It will be no easy task since the doors are
locked and he's hypervigilant of intruders.
3907579	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then what do we do?
3907580	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... If Akashi finds a new power source	
the Palace's security might ease up.
3907581	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But by "power source	 you mean...
3907582,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,A human, whose negative emotions Akashi
can exploit just like Katayama.
3907583,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,There's no way we're waiting for another
person to fall victim just so we can
raid the Palace!
3907584,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,The whole point of changing his heart is so
no one else gets hurt!
3907586,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I agree it's putting the cart before the
horse... but how are we to siege a
sealed Palace?
3907587,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,The next victim, huh?
3907588,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,We have... multiple options.
3907589,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh? Riko-senpai?
3907590,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Leader, may I handle this matter?
3907591,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I have an idea and would like time to
devise a strategy.
3907593,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Yes. This time...
3907594,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,...we'll lure Akashi into a trap.
3907650,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What is it? Is something on your mind?
3907651,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,You must be exhausted from today. I suggest
we turn in early.
3907653,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes... I agree today's mission left much to
be desired.
3907654,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Still, Katayama's Shadow left the Palace,
and the real Katayama was saved.
3907655,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We will have another chance. For now, your
next mission is to steal yourself some sleep.
3907657,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,You're clearly crestfallen, but worry not.
3907658,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Riko said she'll devise a strategy to deal
with Akashi, did she not?
3907659,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,For now, let's have faith in her and simply
do what we can.
3907660,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes, there is lots to do outside the Palace,
such as readying equipment and honing
our skills.
3907661,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Leave the strategizing to Riko and let us
just do what we can.
3907662,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoohoom, if you keep looking so defeated,
Riko may have to take your place as leader.
3907663,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I jest. By my personal estimation, you are
the only one for the job.

CG10235	AAAAAA==	Are you just going to give in?
CG10236	AAAAAA==	We've got a score to settle.
CG10237	AAAAAA==	For Suzui-san's sake.
CG10238	AAAAAA==	She's your friend	 right? Your one and only!
CG10239	AAAAAA==	Mm...
CG10240	AAAAAA==	Good grief... Took you long enough.
CG10241	AAAAAA==	Who is going to avenge her	
CG10242	AAAAAA==	if you don't take a stand here?
CG10243	AAAAAA==	I am thou...
CG10244	AAAAAA==	Thou art I...
CG10245	AAAAAA==	Takamaki has a Persona	 too!?
CG10339	AAAAAA==	Ah...!
CG10246	AAAAAA==	How dare you! Enough of your insolence!
CG10247	AAAAAA==	No	 I've had enough of you!
CG10248	AAAAAA==	No one's gonna stop me now!
CG10249	AAAAAA==	Let's do this	 everyone!
CG10250	AAAAAA==	You're going down in style!
CG10251	AAAAAA==	Every rose has its thorns!
CG10252	AAAAAA==	Th-This can't be happening!
CG10253	AAAAAA==	Wait...!
CG10254	AAAAAA==	Wh-What's with this suit?
CG10255	AAAAAA==	Since when!?
CG10340	AAAAAA==	Ooh!
CG10256	AAAAAA==	D-Don't look!
CG10257	AAAAAA==	We'll explain later!
CG10258	AAAAAA==	Reinforcements are on their way!
CG10259	AAAAAA==	Here... Gimme your arm.
CG10260	AAAAAA==	You take the other side.
CG10261	AAAAAA==	The Phantom Thieves of Hearts...?
CG10262	AAAAAA==	That reaction from Kamoshida...
CG10263	AAAAAA==	It's proof that our actions in the Palace had an effect.
CG10264	AAAAAA==	How so?
CG10265	AAAAAA==	You saw	 didn't you?
CG10266	AAAAAA==	The Treasure...
CG10267	AAAAAA==	...It manifests when its owner feels threatened.
CG10268	AAAAAA==	By sending the calling card
CG10269	AAAAAA==	we should be able to steal it!
CG10270	AAAAAA==	So once we steal his Treasure	 Kamoshida will have a change of heart...
CG10271	AAAAAA==	Right. Let's regroup later tonight.
CG10272	AAAAAA==	We'll meet at midnight
CG10273	AAAAAA==	in front of the school gates!
CG10274	AAAAAA==	Finally... Our Phantom Thief debut.
CG10275	AAAAAA==	Gotta admit	 I'm kinda nervous.
CG10276	AAAAAA==	We sent the calling card.
CG10277	AAAAAA==	Failure is not an option.
CG10278	AAAAAA==	That goes without saying.
CG10279	AAAAAA==	Ready when you are!
CG10280	AAAAAA==	Let's move.
CG10281	AAAAAA==	I'm a cut above all other humans!
CG10282	AAAAAA==	He's possessed by his twisted desires.
CG10283	AAAAAA==	A true demon.
CG10284	AAAAAA==	That's riiiiight!
CG10285	AAAAAA==	I am the demon who rules this wooooorld!
CG10286	AAAAAA==	Gold Medal...
CG10287	AAAAAA==	Attaaaaack!
CG10288	AAAAAA==	Persona!
CG10289	AAAAAA==	Huh!?
CG10341	AAAAAA==	Hrrrraaaaagh!
CG10290	AAAAAA==	Go! Go! Kamoshi...da!
CG10291	AAAAAA==	Not my crown!
CG10292	AAAAAA==	Checkmate.
CG10293	AAAAAA==	We did it... right?
CG10294	AAAAAA==	Mr. Kamoshida...?
CG10295	AAAAAA==	I have repeatedly done things that were unbecoming of a teacher.
CG10296	AAAAAA==	Verbally abusing students...
CG10297	AAAAAA==	Physically abusing my team...
CG10298	AAAAAA==	And...
CG10299	AAAAAA==	Sexually harassing female students...
CG10300	AAAAAA==	The reason why Shiho Suzui-san tried to kill herself...
CG10301	AAAAAA==	It's all because of me.
CG10302	AAAAAA==	I am an arrogant	 shallow...
CG10303	AAAAAA==	and shameful person.
CG10304	AAAAAA==	No	 I'm worse than that!
CG10305	AAAAAA==	I will take responsibility and kill myself for it!
CG10306	AAAAAA==	Mr. Kamoshida! C-Calm down!
CG10307	AAAAAA==	I‚Äî
CG10308	AAAAAA==	I‚Äî
CG10309	AAAAAA==	Don't run	 you bastard!
CG10310	AAAAAA==	Shiho	 who jumped...
CG10311	AAAAAA==	And everyone who turned a blind eye...
CG10312	AAAAAA==	All of us...
CG10313	AAAAAA==	...have to live in this reality and bear the burden of our regrets!
CG10314	AAAAAA==	You have no right to run from this!
CG10315	AAAAAA==	You're right...
CG10316	AAAAAA==	You're absolutely right...
CG10317	AAAAAA==	I should be punished under the law...
CG10318	AAAAAA==	And atone for my crimes...
CG10319	AAAAAA==	I officially turn myself in!
CG10320	AAAAAA==	Please call the police!
CG10321	AAAAAA==	So that means...
CG10322	AAAAAA==	It's just like the calling card said...
CG10323	AAAAAA==	Are the Phantom Thieves of Hearts legit?
CG10324	AAAAAA==	That's all for today's assembly!
CG10325	AAAAAA==	Return to your classes immediately!
CG10400	AAAAAA==	I totally panicked when I saw the "Closed
for Cleaning" sign at the bathrooms...
CG10401	AAAAAA==	Cus you ate too much.
CG10402	AAAAAA==	What are you	 a child?
CG10403	AAAAAA==	Come on	 Takamaki-san's waiting.
CG10404	AAAAAA==	Let's hurry back.
CG10405	AAAAAA==	Ngh... Ungh...
CG10406	AAAAAA==	Have the car ready downstairs.
CG10407	AAAAAA==	We'll return to party headquarters until our meeting
CG10408	AAAAAA==	with the Minister of Infrastructure.
CG10409	AAAAAA==	H-Hey!
CG10410	AAAAAA==	The Chief Secretary...
CG10411	AAAAAA==	What did he say?
CG10412	AAAAAA==	To monitor the situation
CG10413	AAAAAA==	and refrain from making a statement until public opinion has cooled.
CG10414	AAAAAA==	What a coward...
CG10415	AAAAAA==	Perfectly content with his seat in the cabinet. A complacent old fart.
CG10416	AAAAAA==	Hey	 baldy.
CG10417	AAAAAA==	We were here first	 ya know?
CG10418	AAAAAA==	Have they started a day care here?
CG10419	AAAAAA==	You're gone for one second and the clientele completely changes.
CG10420	AAAAAA==	Huh!? Get back here!
CG10421	AAAAAA==	Ugh... What the hell was his deal?
CG10422	AAAAAA==	No clue.
CG10423	AAAAAA==	Grumpy bastard...
CG10424	AAAAAA==	Walking around like he owns the place.
CG10342	AAAAAA==	Hm?
CG10343	AAAAAA==	Huh...
CG10425	AAAAAA==	So you're a regular here	 Sae-san?
CG10426	AAAAAA==	I wouldn't call her a regular.
CG10427	AAAAAA==	So	 what brings you in today?
CG10428	AAAAAA==	Nothing...
CG10429	AAAAAA==	I just like the coffee here.
CG10430	AAAAAA==	Huh?
CG10431	AAAAAA==	Have we met somewhere before?
CG10432	AAAAAA==	My name is Goro Akechi.
CG10433	AAAAAA==	You have a nice place here.
CG10434	AAAAAA==	It has a real je ne sais quoi.
CG10435	AAAAAA==	Akechi...?
CG10436	AAAAAA==	You know...
CG10437	AAAAAA==	Detectives are such ambiguous creatures.
CG10438	AAAAAA==	Wouldn't you agree?
CG10439	AAAAAA==	Their value isn't self-evident through mere existence alone.
CG10440	AAAAAA==	No	 they need two things to become fully realized.
CG10441	AAAAAA==	The first is a difficult case that only they can solve.
CG10442	AAAAAA==	The second is a worthy opponent at its center.
CG10443	AAAAAA==	Sorry to bore you. I tend to get carried away at times.
CG10444	AAAAAA==	I knew it...
CG10445	AAAAAA==	He's the Detective Prince everyone's talking about.
CG10446	AAAAAA==	Who the hell are you?
CG10447	AAAAAA==	And why are you following us?
CG10448	AAAAAA==	Simply exquisite...
CG10344	AAAAAA==	Huh!?
CG10449	AAAAAA==	Go on	 answer me!
CG10450	AAAAAA==	I'm a second year at Kosei High School.
CG10451	AAAAAA==	My name is Yusuke Kitagawa.
CG10452	AAAAAA==	I'm an aspiring artist	 so I live and train with the Japanese painter	
CG10453	AAAAAA==	Ichiryusai Madarame	 as his apprentice.
CG10454	AAAAAA==	You are the woman I've been searching for all this time!
CG10455	AAAAAA==	I beg of you. Be my‚Äî!
CG10456	AAAAAA==	Wait	 seriously...?
CG10457	AAAAAA==	H-Hold on a second!
CG10458	AAAAAA==	We're in public!
CG10459	AAAAAA==	Be my‚Äî
CG10460	AAAAAA==	Muse! The subject of my painting!
CG10345	AAAAAA==	Huh?
CG10461	AAAAAA==	Madarame-sensei's exhibition will begin this weekend.
CG10462	AAAAAA==	I'll be there to help out on opening day.
CG10463	AAAAAA==	I can fill you in on the details then.
CG10464	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 not going. Art's not my thing.
CG10465	AAAAAA==	I think I'll check it out...
CG10466	AAAAAA==	For real!?
CG10467	AAAAAA==	Lady Ann	 don't tell me you fell in love with Yusuke at first sight!?
CG10468	AAAAAA==	No	 no	 nothing like that.
CG10469	AAAAAA==	It's a free ticket	 you know?
CG10470	AAAAAA==	Plus	 going to a solo-exhibit seems kinda classy.
CG10471	AAAAAA==	Poser.
CG10472	AAAAAA==	Shut it!
CG10473	AAAAAA==	I see...
CG10474	AAAAAA==	So the act of emptying one's mind gives rise to inner beauty.
CG10475	AAAAAA==	That's Master Madarame for you!
CG10476	AAAAAA==	Master. A curious word that hardly bears meaning.
CG10477	AAAAAA==	Takamaki-san!
CG10478	AAAAAA==	You came!
CG10479	AAAAAA==	Um... yeah.
CG10480	AAAAAA==	You really came.
CG10481	AAAAAA==	Is that a problem?
CG10482	AAAAAA==	Make sure that you don't get in the way of the other visitors.
CG10483	AAAAAA==	Shall we get going?
CG10484	AAAAAA==	I'll serve as your guide.
CG10485	AAAAAA==	We can discuss the painting I'd like you to model for	 too.
CG10486	AAAAAA==	Ah	 okay...
CG10487	AAAAAA==	Catch you guys later.
CG10488	AAAAAA==	Oh! There it is!
CG10489	AAAAAA==	The painting I wanted to see in person!
CG10490	AAAAAA==	...This one?
CG10491	AAAAAA==	You wanted to see this one?
CG10492	AAAAAA==	Yeah!
CG10493	AAAAAA==	It saw it on TV.
CG10494	AAAAAA==	It left a huge impression on me.
CG10495	AAAAAA==	Maybe it was the anger behind it?
CG10496	AAAAAA==	I'm not sure	
CG10497	AAAAAA==	but I sense this burning rage behind it.
CG10498	AAAAAA==	Mr. Madarame has always seemed like such a calm person in interviews
CG10499	AAAAAA==	but he can paint things like this	 too.
CG10500	AAAAAA==	There are much better paintings than this	 you know.
CG10501	AAAAAA==	Follow me.
CG10502	AAAAAA==	So why did you call us here?
CG10503	AAAAAA==	I'm sorry...
CG10504	AAAAAA==	There's something that's been bothering me.
CG10505	AAAAAA==	...Here	 look at this.
CG10506	AAAAAA==	The post sounds like it's about Madarame.
CG10507	AAAAAA==	Japanese Master Painter Plagiarizes His Apprentice's Work...!?
CG10508	AAAAAA==	Now	 I know it's a bit sudden	 but we have a favor to ask of you	 Lady Ann.
CG10509	AAAAAA==	Me?
CG10510	AAAAAA==	Very well.
CG10511	AAAAAA==	There's something I'd like to show you all.
CG10512	AAAAAA==	The thing I wanted to show you...
CG10513	AAAAAA==	...is this.
CG10514	AAAAAA==	It's his debut work and magnum opus...
CG10515	AAAAAA==	Sayuri.
CG10516	AAAAAA==	This is the painting that inspired me to become an artist.
CG10517	AAAAAA==	When I first laid eyes on you	 Takamaki-san	
CG10518	AAAAAA==	I had the same feeling I got when I first saw this painting.
CG10519	AAAAAA==	So I ask you once more...
CG10520	AAAAAA==	Please consider being my model.
CG10521	AAAAAA==	Forgive me	
CG10522	AAAAAA==	but I must assist Sensei today.
CG10523	AAAAAA==	We can continue this discussion at a later date.
CG10524	AAAAAA==	Guess we were wrong	 huh?
CG10525	AAAAAA==	Let's get outta here.
CG10526	AAAAAA==	It really is a "shack	 huh?
CG10527,AAAAAA==,Right? I was shocked.
CG10528,AAAAAA==,Hm? What's up?
CG10529,AAAAAA==,The Meta-Nav is reacting.
CG10530,AAAAAA==,-Huh!?
-No way!
CG10531,AAAAAA==,Palace detected.
CG10532,AAAAAA==,A Palace!?
CG10533,AAAAAA==,How!?
CG10534,AAAAAA==,...Museum"?
CG10535	AAAAAA==	Beginning navigation.
CG10536	AAAAAA==	That's Master Madarame for ya!
CG10537	AAAAAA==	Plagiarism? "Abuse"?
CG10538	AAAAAA==	What's wrong with that?
CG10539	AAAAAA==	I provide for my apprentices	 and in return...
CG10540	AAAAAA==	...they give me their art!
CG10541	AAAAAA==	It's no different than an investment.
CG10542	AAAAAA==	But lately all my apprentices
CG10543	AAAAAA==	are quick to resist or flee.
CG10544	AAAAAA==	All the more reason for me to break them in.
CG10545	AAAAAA==	But the last one left is a true gem.
CG10546	AAAAAA==	Yusuke has talent.
CG10547	AAAAAA==	He also feels indebted to me.
CG10548	AAAAAA==	He's mine to push around until I tire of‚Äîno	 until my dying breath!
CG10549	AAAAAA==	Skull.
CG10550	AAAAAA==	You saw something that looked like that locked door?
CG10551	AAAAAA==	Yeah.
CG10552	AAAAAA==	It resembled a door in that shack in the real world.
CG10553	AAAAAA==	If I remember correctly	 that door had an unusually large lock on it.
CG10554	AAAAAA==	If we can open it
CG10555	AAAAAA==	then maybe the Palace door will unlock	 too.
CG10556	AAAAAA==	But doing that won't be enough.
CG10557	AAAAAA==	We'll also need to change Madarame's belief that the door is unopenable...
CG10558	AAAAAA==	Meaning we'll need to open it right in front of him!
CG10559	AAAAAA==	O-Okay...
CG10560	AAAAAA==	I guess I'll get undressed	 then.
CG10561	AAAAAA==	Yes	 please do.
CG10562	AAAAAA==	You're going to embarrass me
CG10563	AAAAAA==	if you keep staring at me like that!
CG10564	AAAAAA==	Could you look the other way?
CG10565	AAAAAA==	Will that help?
CG10566	AAAAAA==	Okay.
CG10567	AAAAAA==	Hurry up!
CG10568	AAAAAA==	What are you even doing!?
CG10569	AAAAAA==	Sorry. I've almost got it...
CG10570	AAAAAA==	Takamaki-san?
CG10571	AAAAAA==	What do I even say!?
CG10572	AAAAAA==	I'm home.
CG10573	AAAAAA==	All right	 it's open!
CG10574	AAAAAA==	S-Sensei!?
CG10575	AAAAAA==	Yusuke?
CG10576	AAAAAA==	What are you doing there!?
CG10577	AAAAAA==	It's...
CG10578	AAAAAA==	It's not what it looks like!
CG10579	AAAAAA==	This is the real "Sayuri"!
CG10580	AAAAAA==	I thought it was stolen.
CG10581	AAAAAA==	I've reported you to my private security company!
CG10582	AAAAAA==	If you insist on making a fuss about this...
CG10583	AAAAAA==	Yusuke!
CG10584	AAAAAA==	I'll turn you in to the police!
CG10585	AAAAAA==	Run for it	 Lady Ann!
CG10586	AAAAAA==	Takamaki-san!
CG10587	AAAAAA==	...Takamaki-san?
CG10588	AAAAAA==	That means you two are...
CG10589	AAAAAA==	Great	 you're here too now?
CG10590	AAAAAA==	What is this place?
CG10591	AAAAAA==	Is that...?
CG10592	AAAAAA==	Madarame!?
CG10593	AAAAAA==	Sensei... is that you? That attire...
CG10594	AAAAAA==	My usual ragged attire is nothing but an act.
CG10595	AAAAAA==	Why would a famous person ever live in a shack?
CG10596	AAAAAA==	I have another residence	 obviously.
CG10597	AAAAAA==	Why!?
CG10598	AAAAAA==	Why did you forget the true meaning of art!?
CG10599	AAAAAA==	What would you know about art!?
CG10600	AAAAAA==	Talking down to me like you know best...
CG10601	AAAAAA==	I'll shut you up here and now!
CG10346	AAAAAA==	Dammit!
CG10602	AAAAAA==	Your little rebellion is over!
CG10603	AAAAAA==	Kitagawa-kun!
CG10604	AAAAAA==	You're different from this riff raff.
CG10605	AAAAAA==	My little moneymaker... A bona fide cash cow.
CG10606	AAAAAA==	Did you really think I took you in out of the goodness
of my heart? You	 with no connections?
CG10607	AAAAAA==	No	 your talent was a ripe fruit just waiting to be plucked.
CG10608	AAAAAA==	After taming you like livestock	 I'll discard you
as soon as you lose your value.
CG10609	AAAAAA==	You idiot!
CG10610	AAAAAA==	I truly was blind!
CG10611	AAAAAA==	Have you finally come to your senses?
CG10612	AAAAAA==	It is time you teach people which is which!
CG10613	AAAAAA==	Come forth!
CG10614	AAAAAA==	A breathtaking sight...
CG10615	AAAAAA==	Imitations they may be	
CG10616	AAAAAA==	but together	 they make a fine spectacle...
CG10617	AAAAAA==	Though the flowers of evil blossom	 be it known...
CG10618	AAAAAA==	Abominations are fated to perish!
CG10619	AAAAAA==	You dare slander my art!? You ungrateful wretch!
CG10620	AAAAAA==	I can now ascertain your true self without any reservations...
CG10621	AAAAAA==	With Goemon by my side!
CG10622	AAAAAA==	Ha! You truly are pathetic.
CG10623	AAAAAA==	Madarame!
CG10624	AAAAAA==	You shall forever rue the day
CG10625	AAAAAA==	you dared defy me!
CG10626	AAAAAA==	Wait!
CG10627	AAAAAA==	Under the guise of authority	 you stole your apprentice's ideas
CG10628	AAAAAA==	and went so far as to claim them as your own.
CG10629	AAAAAA==	We have decided to make you confess
all your crimes with your own mouth.
CG10630	AAAAAA==	We will take your distorted desires without fail.
CG10631	AAAAAA==	From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts!
CG10632	AAAAAA==	What's the meaning of this!?
CG10633	AAAAAA==	What's that?
CG10634	AAAAAA==	It kinda looks like a face...
CG10635	AAAAAA==	THIS is the Treasure!?
CG10636	AAAAAA==	Look out!
CG10637	AAAAAA==	Meddlesome vermin...
CG10638	AAAAAA==	You've wreaked enough havoc in my museum.
CG10639	AAAAAA==	That's...
CG10640	AAAAAA==	Brace yourselves. He's about to transform!
CG10641	AAAAAA==	I make the rules in the art scene!
CG10642	AAAAAA==	I am the supreme being!
CG10643	AAAAAA==	I am the god of the art world!
CG10644	AAAAAA==	I will paint you...
CG10645	AAAAAA==	...paint you out of existence!
CG10646	AAAAAA==	That's...
CG10647	AAAAAA==	It looks like the same thing Madarame is using!
CG10648	AAAAAA==	If we can completely cover him in it‚Äî!
CG10649	AAAAAA==	Allow me to handle that.
CG10650	AAAAAA==	Do it.
CG10651	AAAAAA==	Giving up so soon!?
CG10652	AAAAAA==	Madarame!
CG10653	AAAAAA==	M-My power... It's fading!
CG10654	AAAAAA==	Come forth...
CG10655	AAAAAA==	Leanan Sidhe!
CG10656	AAAAAA==	Zorro! Let's press the advantage!
CG10657	AAAAAA==	Captain Kidd!
CG10658	AAAAAA==	Carmen!
CG10659	AAAAAA==	You little...
CG10660	AAAAAA==	I am "the"...
CG10661	AAAAAA==	great Madarame!
CG10662	AAAAAA==	Brace yourself...
CG10663	AAAAAA==	Come forth	 Goemon!
CG10664	AAAAAA==	Uh-oh!
CG10665	AAAAAA==	The Palace is starting to collapse!
CG10666	AAAAAA==	We've gotta get outta here	 Fox!
CG10667	AAAAAA==	W-Wait	 Yusuke!
CG10668	AAAAAA==	What am I supposed to do now?
CG10669	AAAAAA==	Put an end to all this...
CG10670	AAAAAA==	...and use your own artwork for once.
CG10671	AAAAAA==	I-I...
CG10672	AAAAAA==	...have committed crimes that are unbecoming of an artist...
CG10673	AAAAAA==	Plainly put I... p-plagiarized work...!
CG10674	AAAAAA==	To the Japanese arts community...
CG10675	AAAAAA==	To "Sayuri"...
CG10676	AAAAAA==	And to everyone...
CG10677	AAAAAA==	How can I ever make up for my...
CG10678	AAAAAA==	Make up for my... transgressions?
CG10679	AAAAAA==	In this press conference	 famous painter Madarame
CG10680	AAAAAA==	has confessed to plagiarism and the abuse of his apprentices.
CG10681	AAAAAA==	The police have opened an investigation
CG10682	AAAAAA==	to corroborate his claims.
CG10683	AAAAAA==	He has also admitted to faking the theft of his masterpiece "Sayuri"
CG10684	AAAAAA==	as part of an elaborate counterfeiting scheme.
CG10685	AAAAAA==	At this press conference a few days prior	
CG10686	AAAAAA==	it was also revealed that a group calling themselves the
Phantom Thieves posted a dubious note at Madarame's exhibit.
CG10687	AAAAAA==	The police are looking into any possible connection between these events.
CG10688	AAAAAA==	Seriously though... what're we gonna do about him?
CG10689	AAAAAA==	Come stay at our place!
CG10690	AAAAAA==	You're a vital part of our team	 after all.
CG10691	AAAAAA==	It's only natural that we lend a hand!
CG10692	AAAAAA==	It's kinda dirty	 but at least you'll have somewhere to sleep!
CG10693	AAAAAA==	Why're you the one calling the shots?
CG10694	AAAAAA==	And the caf√©'s only a minute walk from the station!
CG10695	AAAAAA==	Not bad.
CG10696	AAAAAA==	Then how about we go there now and have a party
CG10697	AAAAAA==	to celebrate Madarame's change of heart!?
CG10698	AAAAAA==	Good idea! We can make it a welcome party for Yusuke	 too!
CG10699	AAAAAA==	It's decided!
CG10700	AAAAAA==	Sorry to cause you trouble.
CG10701	AAAAAA==	So	 what are we going to do food-wise?
CG10702	AAAAAA==	How about hot pot? A hot pot party!
CG10703	AAAAAA==	I only ask that we finish it off with porridge. Extra parsley	 of course.
CG10704	AAAAAA==	It'll be up to you to convince the chief.
CG10705	AAAAAA==	I doubt he'll take it well...
CG10706	AAAAAA==	I don't mind.
CG10707	AAAAAA==	Won't make much difference adding one more tenant.
CG10708	AAAAAA==	Though I won't tolerate any noise or disturbances late at night.
CG10709	AAAAAA==	Yes	 thank you!
CG10710	AAAAAA==	Thank you for letting me stay.
CG10711	AAAAAA==	Don't mind me!
CG10712	AAAAAA==	Coming through!
CG10713	AAAAAA==	Friends	 huh?
CG10714	AAAAAA==	D-Don't get the wrong idea!
I'm helping the Phantom Thieves for my own sake!
CG10715	AAAAAA==	If you guys don't get stronger	 I won't stand
a chance of getting further in Mementos!
CG10716	AAAAAA==	One second you're depressed	
the next you're actin' all tough...
CG10717	AAAAAA==	Hey	 let's keep going with this.
CG10718	AAAAAA==	I want to take this as far as we can.
CG10719	AAAAAA==	Punishing corrupt adults and helping those in need...
CG10720	AAAAAA==	Only we can do that!
CG10721	AAAAAA==	Ha! You can say that again!
CG10722	AAAAAA==	Being a member of the Phantom Thieves will surely help me grow	
CG10723	AAAAAA==	both as an artist and a person.
CG10724	AAAAAA==	Then I'll train you myself.
CG10725	AAAAAA==	As Phantom Thieves	 there's nothing we can't do!
CG10726	AAAAAA==	So	 leader... We're counting on you.
CG10727	AAAAAA==	...Same here.
CG10728	AAAAAA==	I'm turning off the lights.
CG10347	AAAAAA==	Okay.
CG10729	AAAAAA==	Night	 guys.
CG10730	AAAAAA==	Good night.
CG10731	AAAAAA==	...What is this?
CG10732	AAAAAA==	I found this flyer stuffed in my mailbox!
CG10733	AAAAAA==	Housekeeping Service!
CG10734	AAAAAA==	It says that a cute maid will do anything for you!
CG10735	AAAAAA==	A maid	 dude! A MAID!
CG10736	AAAAAA==	You're a dude	 right? You know what that means.
CG10737	AAAAAA==	Right? ...Right!?
CG10738	AAAAAA==	You mean... helping out at the cafe?
CG10739	AAAAAA==	No	 dumbass!
CG10740	AAAAAA==	We can do it at my apartment.
CG10741	AAAAAA==	The neighbors on my floor just moved out	 so there's a spare room.
CG10742	AAAAAA==	The key is behind the mailbox	 so we can get in anytime.
CG10743	AAAAAA==	But	 that's‚Äî
CG10744	AAAAAA==	Studying's important and all...
CG10745	AAAAAA==	but you've gotta take breaks	 too!
CG10746	AAAAAA==	...Hey	 I heard that!
CG10747	AAAAAA==	Can I get in on this plan of yours?
CG10748	AAAAAA==	Oh-ho! You're into this kind of stuff	 Mishima?
CG10749	AAAAAA==	Least you're honest about it	 unlike this guy.
CG10750	AAAAAA==	I-I'm not into it!
CG10751	AAAAAA==	It's just for research!
CG10752	AAAAAA==	What does it mean that they'll do "anything"?
CG10753	AAAAAA==	And what's the level of service these so-called maids give?
CG10754	AAAAAA==	Are they just as advertised?
CG10755	AAAAAA==	This service is super shady! We have a moral obligation to investigate!
CG10756	AAAAAA==	To rid this world of evil!
CG10757	AAAAAA==	Rid the world of evil?
CG10758	AAAAAA==	When you put it like that...
CG10759	AAAAAA==	When you put it like that	 I guess we have... no choice!
CG10760	AAAAAA==	Renren!
CG10761	AAAAAA==	It's settled	 then.
CG10762	AAAAAA==	So what's the code name for this operation? Hmm...
CG10763	AAAAAA==	I've got it. Operation Maidwatch.
CG10764	AAAAAA==	AKA	 Meet-A-Maid Up Close And Personal!
CG10765	AAAAAA==	Nice! I like that!
CG10766	AAAAAA==	Good evening! Your housekeeping service has arrived!
CG10767	AAAAAA==	Crap! I've got butterflies in my stomach!
CG10768	AAAAAA==	S-Same!
CG10769	AAAAAA==	Oh	 the door's unlocked...
CG10770	AAAAAA==	Um	 is it all right for me to come in?
CG10771	AAAAAA==	I-I can't do this!
CG10772	AAAAAA==	Sorry	 the rest is up to you.
CG10773	AAAAAA==	Don't let her know you're in high school	 got it?
CG10774	AAAAAA==	I've got your back! Just... From way back!
Like	 from the balcony!
CG10775	AAAAAA==	S-Same!
CG10776	AAAAAA==	I'm coming in!
CG10777	AAAAAA==	Ah	 so you were home after all.
CG10778	AAAAAA==	In that case... I'll take my leave for the night.
CG10779	AAAAAA==	Wh-Whaaat!? Just like that?
CG10780	AAAAAA==	Is someone there!?
CG10781	AAAAAA==	You moron!
CG10782	AAAAAA==	Oh crap! Run for it	 Mishima!
CG10783	AAAAAA==	Mishima? And that voice...
CG10784	AAAAAA==	Sakamoto-kun!?
CG10785	AAAAAA==	So then... you really are...
CG10786	AAAAAA==	Ms. Kawakami	 aren't you?
CG10787	AAAAAA==	Y-You're...!
CG10788	AAAAAA==	Oh	 um...!
CG10789	AAAAAA==	Yes	 it's me... your homeroom teacher...
CG10790	AAAAAA==	...Who did you hear about this from?
CG10791	AAAAAA==	It was Ms. Chouno	 wasn't it?
CG10792	AAAAAA==	She's been all up in my business lately.
CG10793	AAAAAA==	Hey... It won't be any better for you if people
find out that you called a maid service.
CG10794	AAAAAA==	Let's just pretend none of this ever happened.
CG10795	AAAAAA==	I'll treat this as a cancellation so you won't have to pay anything.
CG10796	AAAAAA==	Anyway	 I'm leaving.
CG10797	AAAAAA==	Hey... Is it really okay for us keep going?
CG10798	AAAAAA==	We can't let the cops scare us outta
bein' Phantom Thieves.
CG10799	AAAAAA==	Is something the matter?
CG10800	AAAAAA==	My ears are always open to the troubles
of my peers	 you know.
CG10801	AAAAAA==	Seriously? Like you'd be able to help with anything...
CG10802	AAAAAA==	What did the student council do to help Shiho
when Kamoshida was abusing her?
CG10803	AAAAAA==	You're one to talk. As her friend	 what did YOU do?
CG10804	AAAAAA==	You were much closer to her than I ever was.
CG10805	AAAAAA==	You're right... I wasn't able to help her at all.
CG10806	AAAAAA==	But... Because I had friends by my side...
CG10807	AAAAAA==	I was finally able to speak to her when it was all done.
CG10808	AAAAAA==	I faced her and told her everything I'd been holding back!
CG10809	AAAAAA==	Doesn't that count for something?
CG10810	AAAAAA==	Wanting to help someone in need...
CG10811	AAAAAA==	Everyone has that impulse.
CG10812	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 that's the kind of thing I can get behind.
CG10813	AAAAAA==	...Just make sure you show up to your classes	 all right?
CG10814	AAAAAA==	I take back what I said before
CG10815	AAAAAA==	about whether it's really okay for us keep going.
CG10816	AAAAAA==	I'd be ashamed to let it end now...
CG10817	AAAAAA==	That's what I'm talking about! We haven't done anything wrong!
CG10818	AAAAAA==	This is our style of justice!
CG10348	AAAAAA==	Yeah.
CG10819	AAAAAA==	Justice...
CG10820	AAAAAA==	I have something I'd like you all to listen to...
CG10821	AAAAAA==	Wh-What the hell!?
CG10822	AAAAAA==	A friend of yours?
CG10823	AAAAAA==	It's nice to meet you.
CG10824	AAAAAA==	I'm Makoto Niijima	 third year at Shujin Academy.
CG10825	AAAAAA==	What's the meaning of this...?
CG10826	AAAAAA==	Take a listen to this.
CG10827	AAAAAA==	Hey...
CG10828	AAAAAA==	Is it really okay for us keep going?
CG10829	AAAAAA==	We can't let the cops scare us outta
bein' Phantom Thieves!
CG10830	AAAAAA==	What do you think the police would do if they heard this?
CG10831	AAAAAA==	Why are you here?
CG10832	AAAAAA==	Did you really come just to tell us
CG10833	AAAAAA==	that you're going to report us?
CG10834	AAAAAA==	I came here to verify...
CG10835	AAAAAA==	this "justice" you speak of.
CG10836	AAAAAA==	Right now I'm the only one who's heard this.
CG10837	AAAAAA==	If you prove what you're doing is just	
CG10838	AAAAAA==	I'll erase this.
CG10839	AAAAAA==	She wants to make a deal...
CG10840	AAAAAA==	What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
CG10841	AAAAAA==	There is someone whose heart I'd like you to change.
CG10842	AAAAAA==	Who?
CG10843	AAAAAA==	So you're not saying it's impossible.
CG10844	AAAAAA==	The boss of a criminal organization.
CG10845	AAAAAA==	A criminal organization!?
CG10846	AAAAAA==	They operate using phishing scams and drug trafficking.
CG10847	AAAAAA==	What's worse	 once you're in their sights	
CG10848	AAAAAA==	they won't stop threatening you
CG10849	AAAAAA==	until they get what they want.
CG10850	AAAAAA==	Where can we meet them?
CG10851	AAAAAA==	Their main hub of activity is here in Shibuya.
CG10852	AAAAAA==	Junya Kaneshiro.
CG10853	AAAAAA==	I think he's probably the guy you're looking for.
CG10854	AAAAAA==	Kaneshiro...
CG10855	AAAAAA==	You should check him out further if you're curious...
CG10856	AAAAAA==	but I'm not responsible for what happens next!
CG10857	AAAAAA==	There's a Palace for Junya Kaneshiro.
CG10858	AAAAAA==	All that's left is figuring out where it is and what form it takes.
CG10859	AAAAAA==	We'll just have to take a guess.
CG10860	AAAAAA==	It's gotta be about money. The guy's name means "money castle."
CG10861	AAAAAA==	He commits fraud and extortion	 right?
CG10862	AAAAAA==	I'm picturing a place filled with money.
CG10863	AAAAAA==	Like a bank...
CG10864	AAAAAA==	Match detected.
CG10865	AAAAAA==	We were right?
CG10866	AAAAAA==	I've got it...
CG10867	AAAAAA==	The place that Kaneshiro thinks of as a bank is...
CG10868	AAAAAA==	All of Shibuya.
CG10869	AAAAAA==	Woah! This is crazy!
CG10870	AAAAAA==	The distortion is affecting the whole of Shibuya!
CG10871	AAAAAA==	So he sees everyone in Shibuya as his patron?
CG10872	AAAAAA==	W-Wait...! What's that!?
CG10873	AAAAAA==	I'm... too tired... Please... let me rest...
CG10874	AAAAAA==	So	 these must be Kaneshiro's victims.
CG10875	AAAAAA==	Yeah.
CG10876	AAAAAA==	At the very least	
CG10877	AAAAAA==	this is the amount of humans that Kaneshiro
believes he's scammed and destroyed.
CG10878	AAAAAA==	This is horrible...
CG10879	AAAAAA==	I see	 it's the same over there.
CG10880	AAAAAA==	Countless victims in all directions.
CG10881	AAAAAA==	We won't let him get away with this!
CG10882	AAAAAA==	But we won't be able to do anything until we can get up there.
CG10883	AAAAAA==	We can't accomplish anything down here.
CG10884	AAAAAA==	Let's head back for now.
CG10885	AAAAAA==	Hello? It's me... Makoto Niijima.
CG10886	AAAAAA==	Just stay on the line and record this call.
CG10887	AAAAAA==	That idiot!
CG10888	AAAAAA==	Well? What now?
CG10889	AAAAAA==	I memorized the license plate!
CG10890	AAAAAA==	Guess my artist's eye finally paid off.
CG10891	AAAAAA==	Are you Kaneshiro?
CG10892	AAAAAA==	What's this? Who did you call?
CG10893	AAAAAA==	Kaneshiro-san	 that's the girl I told you about.
CG10894	AAAAAA==	Deal with her.
CG10895	AAAAAA==	Amamiya-kun!
CG10896	AAAAAA==	What in the world!?
CG10897	AAAAAA==	The hell are you doing to her!?
CG10898	AAAAAA==	You better watch your mouth	 punk!
CG10899	AAAAAA==	Enough.
CG10900	AAAAAA==	What's wrong? Why's everyone so stiff?
CG10901	AAAAAA==	Debauchery of Minors at a Club.
CG10902	AAAAAA==	You don't mind if I send this to your school	 right?
CG10903	AAAAAA==	I feed on dumbshits like you...
CG10904	AAAAAA==	Summer bonuses are around the corner	 you know?
CG10905	AAAAAA==	If you beg your mommies and daddies	
CG10906	AAAAAA==	you'll have the 3 mil in no time.
CG10907	AAAAAA==	That's what all the other brats had to do.
CG10908	AAAAAA==	Run your mouth to the police	
CG10909	AAAAAA==	and I'll break all of you	 starting with your families.
CG10910	AAAAAA==	Now get out of my sight. I'm about to have some fun.
CG10911	AAAAAA==	Would you like to come with us?
CG10912	AAAAAA==	Go with you? Where?
CG10913	AAAAAA==	To the world inside Kaneshiro's Heart.
CG10914	AAAAAA==	I see... So this is how he views the world.
CG10915	AAAAAA==	You want to go to that bank up there	 right?
CG10916	AAAAAA==	Then let's go.
CG10917	AAAAAA==	If I'm a client now...
CG10918	AAAAAA==	No way!
CG10919	AAAAAA==	It's just as I calculated.
CG10920	AAAAAA==	Let them pass.
CG10921	AAAAAA==	Kaneshiro!
CG10922	AAAAAA==	I know why you're here.
CG10923	AAAAAA==	It's about the 3 million yen	 right?
CG10924	AAAAAA==	I have a reasonable payment plan for people like you.
CG10925	AAAAAA==	Join our organization tomorrow
CG10926	AAAAAA==	and pay for it with your body!
CG10927	AAAAAA==	Is that how you've exploited other girls?
CG10928	AAAAAA==	Eehehehe... That's the beautiful student council president for you.
CG10929	AAAAAA==	Or should I say... the younger sister of
the lovely prosecutor	 Sae Niijima.
CG10930	AAAAAA==	How do you know that!?
CG10931	AAAAAA==	Now be a good girl and do as you're told. It'll be over soon.
CG10932	AAAAAA==	Shut your damn mouth	 you money-grubbing asshole!
CG10933	AAAAAA==	Have you decided to tread the path of strife...?
CG10934	AAAAAA==	Yes... Come to me.
CG10935	AAAAAA==	Very well. Let us proceed with our contract at once.
CG10936	AAAAAA==	I am thou	 thou art I...
CG10937	AAAAAA==	A Persona...?
CG10938	AAAAAA==	No	 dude... That's a bike...
CG10939	AAAAAA==	I get it now...
CG10940	AAAAAA==	This is my true self!
CG10941	AAAAAA==	Kaneshiro!
CG10942	AAAAAA==	No! We can't fight him now!
CG10943	AAAAAA==	To change his heart	 we have to steal his Treasure first!
CG10944	AAAAAA==	We know how to get in now!
CG10945	AAAAAA==	Time to retreat!
CG10946	AAAAAA==	Retreat? But how!?
CG10947	AAAAAA==	There's only one exit.
CG10948	AAAAAA==	I'm going on ahead	 so follow me!
CG10949	AAAAAA==	All right	 let's move!
CG10950	AAAAAA==	Sir Junya Kaneshiro	 the money-devouring sinner of gluttony...
CG10951	AAAAAA==	You indulge in scamming others with horrendous
methods that target minors exclusively.
CG10952	AAAAAA==	We have decided to make you confess
all your crimes with your own mouth.
CG10953	AAAAAA==	We will take your distorted desires without fail.
CG10954	AAAAAA==	From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.
CG10955	AAAAAA==	I-Isn't this bad?
CG10956	AAAAAA==	What? The Phantom Thieves?
CG10957	AAAAAA==	Like I give a shit!
CG10958	AAAAAA==	He changed the room into a giant safe that quickly!?
CG10959	AAAAAA==	Greetings.
CG10960	AAAAAA==	Welcome to my private city bank.
CG10961	AAAAAA==	You filthy fly on dirty money...
CG10962	AAAAAA==	Get the hell out of my face!
CG10963	AAAAAA==	Yo! Let's do this thing	 stupid brats!
CG10964	AAAAAA==	Crap!
CG10966	AAAAAA==	Let's do this! Carmen!
CG10349	AAAAAA==	Gah!
CG10967	AAAAAA==	The hell are you doing	 yo!?
CG10968	AAAAAA==	You'll burn the whole place down!
CG10969	AAAAAA==	Now!
CG10970	AAAAAA==	Nue!
CG10971	AAAAAA==	Crumble before me!
CG10972	AAAAAA==	The place you belong... is somewhere you
can make amends for the rest of your life.
CG10973	AAAAAA==	You stupid brats don't get it.
CG10974	AAAAAA==	Look	 asshole... You can cut the crap already.
CG10975	AAAAAA==	You'd better watch your backs for the one in the black mask.
CG10976	AAAAAA==	Their power is in an entirely different league...
CG10977	AAAAAA==	A black mask?
CG10978	AAAAAA==	To think there's someone else out there able to enter Palaces...
CG10979	AAAAAA==	We can think about that later! We need to get out of here!
CG10980	AAAAAA==	Ahahaha! I can't get enough! Soooo cooool!
CG10981	AAAAAA==	Didn't you hear her	 you stupid cat!?
CG10982	AAAAAA==	You shouldn't throw animals	 dammit!
CG10983	AAAAAA==	Whatever	 just step on it!
CG10984	AAAAAA==	Cram inside	 there's no time!
CG10985	AAAAAA==	Crap! There's no road!
CG10986	AAAAAA==	Isn't this the man the Phantom Thieves sent a calling card for?
CG10987	AAAAAA==	I heard he confessed all his crimes.
CG10988	AAAAAA==	It was really... out of nowhere.
CG10989	AAAAAA==	This would only make sense if his personality changed...
CG10990	AAAAAA==	but that would be impossible.
CG10991	AAAAAA==	Isn't it good enough that he's behind bars?
CG10992	AAAAAA==	The issue is that no one received any credit for it.
CG10993	AAAAAA==	Catching him could have landed me a promotion...
CG10994	AAAAAA==	Promotion...?
CG10995	AAAAAA==	You've changed	 Sis.
CG10996	AAAAAA==	But... I'll be okay.
COOP200003	AAAAAA==	Huh? Where is it!?
COOP200008	AAAAAA==	Oh no... Don't tell me it flew away
somewhere...
COOP200010	AAAAAA==	Huh? H-How do you know my name?
COOP200011	AAAAAA==	Huh? It's Ayaka Sakai... Why do you ask?
COOP200012	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh! That's mine!
COOP200013	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Phew	 I thought I lost it!
COOP200014	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you. I can't use this space
without this!
COOP200016	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well... It's a street performance permit.
The city's been pretty strict about having
them lately.
COOP200017	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I was going to play guitar and sing
right here...
COOP200018	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well... I was planning to. This paper is my
street performance permit.
COOP200019	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I was going to play guitar and sing.
COOP200020	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But... It seems like whenever I try	 my urge
to sing just fades away.
COOP200021	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe I just don't have the courage to sing
and perform in front of so many people...
COOP200022	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I got a permit and everything only to just
stand on the street with a guitar.
COOP200023	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	What am I doing...?
COOP200025	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 I used to be in a band. I've been into
music ever since.
COOP200026	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm sorry... I didn't have any problems when
I was in a band	 but now...
COOP200027	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well	 um	 an acoustic guitar arrangement of a
song my old bandmates and I wrote.
COOP200031	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 so you're also in a band! I made mine
with my friends in high school too.
COOP200032	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Performing live freaks me out	 but I never
had any problems when it was just us.
COOP200033	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	What makes it different? Maybe having others
with me that get it too?
COOP200034	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well...
COOP200035	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm not sure if it'll really be useful to
you	 but I feel like... I can play now.
COOP200036	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Having another musician here has kinda
helped me relax	 I guess?
COOP200037	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	All right! Here I go...
COOP200038	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah	 crap! It's that time already!?
COOP200039	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	*sigh* I gotta start my shift at work.
I'll have to try this another time.
COOP200040	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Say... Do you come by here often?
COOP200041	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Next time you're here	 give me a shout.
I feel like I might be able to sing with
you here.
COOP200043	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks! Um...
COOP200044	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry	 can I ask your name? I'm‚Äîwait	 you
know already. Ayaka Sakai. I'm in college.
COOP200046	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
COOP200047	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh right. Is it okay if we exchange
contact info?
COOP200048	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I don't have a single music friend right now	
so I'd love to chat sometime...
COOP200051	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well then	 {NAME1}-kun... See you later!
COOP200100	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah	 {NAME1}-kun!
COOP200101	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I wanna try busking again today	 but I just
can't work up the nerve.
COOP200102	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If it's all right with you... Could you stay
and watch	 maybe?
COOP200104	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you! I'm feeling good today!
COOP200105	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 I see... Meh	 it happens. Join me next
time	 okay?
COOP200106	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Okay	 here goes nothing!
COOP200111	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200112	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ngh...
COOP200114	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry... It just felt like they were ignoring
me and no one was listening...
COOP200115	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole
street performing thing.
COOP200117	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You're right... I haven't even played past
the intro yet.
COOP200118	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah	 I'm sorry! You came out to hear me play	
and here I am moping around...
COOP200119	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm gonna try again!
COOP200120	AAAAAA==	Ayaka?
COOP200121	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh?
COOP200122	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ryoko!
COOP200123	AAAAAA==	Didn't take you for the busking type.
COOP200124	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Y-Yeah... Uh	 I mean... Well...
COOP200125	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I haven't sung anything yet	 actually...
I haven't worked up the nerve to...
COOP200126	AAAAAA==	Oh.
COOP200127	AAAAAA==	C'mon now	 Ayaka...
COOP200128	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh?
COOP200129	AAAAAA==	Sorry	 I have to go. Stuff to do. See you.
COOP200130	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah...
COOP200131	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200134	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	S-Sorry	 I... I'm gonna go grab something
to drink...
COOP200135	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry... I got a little dizzy	 maybe from
the nerves.
COOP200136	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I should be fine now!
COOP200137	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I made you come out here for me	 so I've got
to sing for real today!
COOP200140	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh? Oh	 uh	 right...
COOP200141	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	*sigh* I'm really sorry...
COOP200142	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I shouldn't be making you deal with all
my problems...
COOP200143	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'll try again later. I'm sorry for wasting
your time...
COOP200144	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you again	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP200146	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I didn't pull off a performance	 but having
you here did make me feel better.
COOP200147	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I guess we're done for today. I'll talk to
you later.
COOP200200	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah	 {NAME1}-kun!
COOP200201	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm going to try busking today!
COOP200202	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If it's okay with you	 do you think you could
stay and watch like last time?
COOP200204	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you! I'm giving it my best shot today	
I promise! Just hold on while I set up!
COOP200205	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 I see... Meh	 it happens. Join me next
time	 okay?
COOP200206	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry for leaving you hanging with my last
performance. But today I'm giving it my all!
COOP200207	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You can do this	 Ayaka...
Today's the day for sure...
COOP200208	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	*sigh*
COOP200212	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Uh	 what do mean?
COOP200213	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Wait	 you can see the bags under my eyes!?
But I tried so hard to cover them up...
COOP200216	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You remember that girl who spoke to me last
time we were here?
COOP200217	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well	 her name's Ryoko	 and she's one of my
friends from high school.
COOP200218	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	She invited me to join her band	 and that's
what got me into music.
COOP200219	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I always liked listening to music	 but never
imagined doing it myself.
COOP200220	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If she hadn't brought me into the band	
I don't think I'd be who I am today.
COOP200221	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Anyhow	 things changed after we started
college. Our bandmates all went to
different schools...
COOP200222	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I think the main thing was that Ryoko
just quit playing music one day.
COOP200223	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I guess the band just naturally fell apart
after that.
COOP200225	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Not sure... All I know is she lost the
motivation for it all of a sudden.
COOP200226	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If that was the case	 she could've just
broken up the band and not abandoned
music entirely...
COOP200227	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	At the time	 I did get the feeling that
Ryoko's passion for music was waning.
COOP200228	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I still wanted to play though. So I've been
trying to keep it up...
COOP200229	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I'm a shy person at heart‚Äîor maybe faint
of heart is a better way to put it...
COOP200230	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Either way	 I don't have the courage to start
my own band or join another one.
COOP200231	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I realized I could busk on my own	 so I
thought I'd try that...
COOP200232	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Turns out	 I don't have the guts for this
either... I still haven't actually sung
anything.
COOP200233	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The only reason I've ever been able to make
music is because I've been relying on Ryoko
and the rest of the band...
COOP200234	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	When I saw Ryoko	 I was sure she'd tell me
I'd never be able to play anything solo...
COOP200235	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I know she's not one to say something like
that	 but still	 I do feel like a failure...
COOP200236	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That's pretty much how I feel all the time
lately...
COOP200239	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah... Sorry	 I forgot I had work today!
COOP200240	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I gotta go. I know I didn't manage to sing
today either	 but...
COOP200242	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah... I guess that's true.
COOP200243	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hearing it from you helps me believe it	
at least. Thanks.
COOP200244	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks... It makes me really happy to hear
you say that.
COOP200245	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME1}-kun... Thanks for this. Really.
COOP200247	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You're younger than me	 but you've got it so
together. I should learn from you.
COOP200248	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	See you later	 then... I'll be in touch.
COOP200300	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun! It means a lot that you
came	 but I've got to apologize...
COOP200301	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I couldn't get a permit for today	 so I can't
play music here after all.
COOP200302	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I did bring my guitar	 but just because it
helps me feel calm.
COOP200304	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	R-Really? If you know a place that would
work	 I won't say no...
COOP200305	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 see you. I'm gonna stick around for a
bit. Come say hi if you're free later.
COOP200306	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I don't really know any other places to play
around here. Would you happen to have any
ideas	 {NAME1}-kun?
COOP200309	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 really? Let's try going there	 then!
COOP200310	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I don't have work today	 so I don't mind if
it's a bit out of the way.
COOP200312	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Now I see. This park is pretty big and there
aren't many people around now	 so we can
play without getting in trouble.
COOP200313	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But... Of course	 I'm still getting
nervous...
COOP200315	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	O-Okay...
COOP200316	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Actually	 now that I think about it	 I've
never sung in front of you at all	 have I?
COOP200317	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But...
COOP200318	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's kind of a relief for my first audience
to be just you. It's... nice?
COOP200319	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Okay... Here I go...
COOP200322	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	S-So	 what do you think?
COOP200324	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Th-Thank you! Even if you're just being nice	
I appreciate it.
COOP200325	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah... Super nervous	 I could barely get my
voice out. I'm so rusty...
COOP200328	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Um... Well	 it's not like I've never
performed at all.
COOP200329	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I played rhythm guitar in high school.
Although I liked playing	 I just didn't want
to stand out.
COOP200330	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	One of my friends was the lead vocalist.
The girl we saw in Shibuya the other day.
COOP200331	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	There was one song we did where she got me to
do the vocals.
COOP200332	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That was the one I sang now. It's an original
our band wrote together.
COOP200333	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We put our own music to the lyrics we wrote
and performed it at our school festival.
COOP200334	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I could never forget what it felt like to see
an audience listen to my voice like that.
COOP200335	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think that's why I still cling to my guitar
even after our band broke up.
COOP200336	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But you can see how well that's going...
COOP200338	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Uh... At least for this song	 I think if I
had some way to kick myself into gear...
COOP200339	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Then the nerves would go away	 and I'd be
able to sing through to the end after those
first few notes.
COOP200340	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That's how it felt today. Once I started
singing	 I was cool as a cucumber.
COOP200342	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh? Someone from your band club told
you that?
COOP200343	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I see. They are right that rhythm is
important for a mid-tempo ballad.
COOP200344	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So you think that if I tap out the rhythm
first	 it'll feel more natural to start
singing?
COOP200345	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You might be on the right track there...
It was written for a band	 so it wants a
clear rhythm...
COOP200346	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ugh	 I'm at my limit doing guitar and vocals
alone	 and now I need percussion?
COOP200347	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I can't play drums and the guitar at the
same time...
COOP200349	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hm... Maybe if I did some kind of cheer
before singing? Like sports teams do?
COOP200350	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Like... "We've got spirit! Yes we... do..."
COOP200351	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 never mind...
COOP200352	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe a different cheer would be better?
COOP200354	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	B-Booyah!?
COOP200355	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	R-Ready	 set	 go!?
COOP200356	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh? H-Here... we... GO!?
COOP200357	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hehe. If I have to do that first	 performing
should feel like a breeze.
COOP200358	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks	 I think I'm feeling better about all
this now.
COOP200360	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I finally managed to sing for someone on
my own. Performing really does feel good!
COOP200361	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think I can do this now!
COOP200363	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks!
COOP200365	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The next time I busk	 I'm going to blow
everyone's socks off. Of course	 I'll let you
know before so you can see!
COOP200400	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME1}-kun	 I think I'm going to try
busking today!
COOP200401	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Are you free to stick around and watch?
COOP200403	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks!
COOP200404	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 I see... Don't worry about it then.
Join me another time	 okay?
COOP200405	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	All right... Today's the day!
COOP200407	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 y-yeah!
COOP200408	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	B-Booyah!?
COOP200409	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 y-yeah!
COOP200410	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	R-Ready	 set	 go!?
COOP200411	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 y-yeah!
COOP200412	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	H-Here... we... GO!
COOP200413	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hehe... Hahaha! That was a pretty poor cheer.
COOP200414	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Still	 thanks. That really broke the tension.
I... I really think I can do it today.
COOP200415	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And you'll be watching	 I hope?
COOP200417	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	A trick?
COOP200418	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You... brought something?
COOP200419	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	A tambourine...?
COOP200421	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Whaaat!?
COOP200422	AAAAAA==	Oh	 what's going on here?
COOP200423	AAAAAA==	Is someone performing?
COOP200424	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Wait	 that's right! Rhythm!
COOP200426	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well that explains the tambourine...
COOP200427	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME1}-kun.
COOP200428	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Um... Do you think you could keep doing
that	 but calmer? I want the lead-in to be
super gentle.
COOP200429	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm gonna do the song I played for you in
the park.
COOP200430	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And do you think you could lay a beat in
as a fill after the first verse? Then after
that...
COOP200431	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Just like we discussed	 okay?
COOP200432	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	All right	 let's do this!
COOP200433	AAAAAA==	A busker? I didn't think people did that
around here.
COOP200434	AAAAAA==	I walk by every day	 but I never noticed...
COOP200435	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hm...
COOP200436	AAAAAA==	Wow!
COOP200437	AAAAAA==	That girl's actually pretty good.
COOP200440	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Phew...
COOP200441	AAAAAA==	Oh my god! Your voice is amaaaazing!
COOP200442	AAAAAA==	Everything's been kind of... dull lately	 but
your song really moved me.
COOP200443	AAAAAA==	Do you have an agent yet? You could be a
real hit	 kid!
COOP200444	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	O-Oh	 um... Thank you all very much!
COOP200445	AAAAAA==	......
COOP200447	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME1}-kun! I did it! I sang!
COOP200449	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Y-You really think so? Thank you...
COOP200450	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Uh-huh. My heart's still racing...
COOP200451	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But... I'm just so...
COOP200452	AAAAAA==	Hey	 did you write that song yourself? Do you
have others?
COOP200453	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I-I made it with some friends	 so I guess I
wrote it myself	 in a way?
COOP200454	AAAAAA==	Let's hear another song!
COOP200455	AAAAAA==	Encore! Encore!
COOP200456	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Um	 uh...?
COOP200458	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Uh... Well	 in that case...
COOP200460	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I never expected that you'd show up with a
tambourine of all things!
COOP200461	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But thanks to that little surprise	 I finally
managed to sing my song.
COOP200462	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's like I can still feel that beat you laid
down thumping inside me...
COOP200463	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I know I'll be able to sing from now on	
even on my own.
COOP200464	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you	 {NAME1}-kun. This was an
incredible day.
COOP200465	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	U-Um	 so...
COOP200466	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Now that I've pulled off a performance	 I'm a
bit hungry to do more. You see...
COOP200467	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Eventually... I want to sing an original that
I've made from scratch.
COOP200468	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've never written lyrics or anything before	
so I don't know how long it'll take.
COOP200469	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But if I do manage to write one...
COOP200471	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh!? I-I didn't mean right away...
COOP200472	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hmm	 but...
COOP200473	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I do kinda feel like I could do anything
right now...
COOP200474	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'll give it a shot. Let's see what kind of
song I can write.
COOP200476	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you so much for today. I'll message
you later.
COOP200480	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	AAAAAA==
COOP200503	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	*gasp*
COOP200505	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200506	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry. I saw you earlier	 but I was in the
middle of a song!
COOP200508	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I haven't had trouble singing alone since our
jam sesh together.
COOP200509	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	A lot of people are coming up and listening
to my performances these days!
COOP200510	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And it's all thanks to you! Seriously	
I can't thank you enough.
COOP200511	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 I almost forgot. There's something I
wanted to ask you.
COOP200512	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So I've been trying to write a song like we
talked about...
COOP200513	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But what do you think I should prioritize	
{NAME1}-kun? The lyrics or melody?
COOP200515	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 you're right. I like lyrics that are
full of what the singer's trying to say too.
COOP200516	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You're right. A good	 clear melody can be the
best way to convey a song's feeling.
COOP200517	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah... You don't really have a song until
you have both the words and music.
COOP200518	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've been so stuck on where to start that I
haven't really gotten anywhere with either.
COOP200519	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I have lots of memories and feelings I'd
like to sing about	 chords and riffs I want
to play...
COOP200520	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But when I sit down to write something	
I just can't pick a thing to work on.
COOP200521	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The technical stuff like chord resolutions
and beat structure is pretty easy	 though.
COOP200522	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I guess it's always hard to make something
from scratch. What should I do...?
COOP200524	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	What I want to say... I guess...
COOP200525	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That I love singing and that sharing my
feelings through song makes me happy?
COOP200526	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah... Maybe that's the only way.
COOP200527	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That's what it was like in our band too.
We all kept tossing in ideas till we had
a song.
COOP200528	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	A person that I want to sing to
specifically	 huh...?
COOP200529	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah... I think that could work.
COOP200530	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks	 {NAME1}-kun. I think that made
something click for me.
COOP200531	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'll start working on the song as soon as I
get home. I feel like it'll be a breeze now!
COOP200532	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm glad I asked you about this.
You really are‚Äî
COOP200533	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Whoa... I almost said something super
embarrassing just now...
COOP200534	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Er	 sorry! Never mind	 it was nothing...
COOP200535	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Anyway	 {NAME1}-kun	 do you have time
after this?
COOP200536	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm gonna be playing here for a while	 so if
you'd like to stay and listen...
COOP200537	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Awesome!
COOP200600	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	*sigh*
COOP200603	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun...
COOP200607	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	As I was busking earlier	 Ryoko showed up...
COOP200608	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've been getting better at talking to people
recently	 so I thought I'd say hi to her...
COOP200609	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We talked about a bunch of stuff	 like how
we've been doing	 and I learned why she
quit music.
COOP200610	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	She's wanted to be a professional musician
ever since high school.
COOP200611	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But she said she felt too weighed down by
family stuff and worries that she wasn't
talented enough...
COOP200612	AAAAAA==	You really are a good singer	 Ayaka. Even
while playing guitar	 you don't fall out of
rhythm at all.
COOP200613	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks	 but it's all because you taught me
the basics back in high school!
COOP200614	AAAAAA==	You always had talent. And you seem happier
now. I mean	 you're practically glowing!
COOP200615	AAAAAA==	You were definitely meant to be a musician	
Ayaka. More than I ever was.
COOP200616	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ryoko! That's not true	 you just‚Äî
COOP200617	AAAAAA==	Ayaka... Just keep playing	 okay? Make both
of our dreams come true.
COOP200618	AAAAAA==	I couldn't do it	 but I'm sure you have what
it takes to be great.
COOP200619	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Wh-What!?
COOP200620	AAAAAA==	Hearing you play allowed me to accept that.
Keep at it	 okay?
COOP200621	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Wait	 Ryoko! Don't...
COOP200622	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I wanted to ask her if she was willing to
play music with me again.
COOP200623	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I even thought maybe she could help me with
the song I'm working on...
COOP200624	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Did I do something wrong? What do I do now?
COOP200626	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks... You're very kind.
COOP200627	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No	 I've got so much left to say! I just
don't know how to put it all into words...
COOP200628	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Right now	 I want to...
COOP200629	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME1}-kun	 are you free after this?
COOP200630	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Could you come to Inokashira Park with me?
COOP200631	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Even when I feel like this‚Äîno	 especially
when I feel like this	 I really want to sing.
COOP200632	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But not as a street performance. The only
person I want to listen to this song is you.
COOP200633	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you. Let's go to the usual spot	 then?
COOP200636	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry... I guess I just made you listen to a
whole medley of sad songs...
COOP200637	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's funny though. Sad songs are more
comforting to sing than cheerful ones.
COOP200638	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I wonder why...
COOP200640	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 of course.
COOP200641	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If I know it	 I'll sing it for you. I've been
making you listen to my feelings all
the time.
COOP200642	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Haha	 sure...
COOP200643	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm always learning things from you	 so it'd
be nice to be the teacher for once.
COOP200644	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ugh... There you go looking after me again...
COOP200645	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Okay	 how about we play something together
next time? You can bring your bass.
COOP200646	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's a plan	 then! I'm looking forward to it.
COOP200700	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200703	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 {NAME2}-kun!
COOP200705	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Perfect timing! I was just about to send you
a message.
COOP200706	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Remember what we talked about last time?
About playing a song together?
COOP200707	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Would you be up for that now? If you have
time	 of course.
COOP200708	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Great... You'll need to get your bass
first	 though.
COOP200709	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey	 can I come with you? I don't mind
waiting here	 but it feels like a waste.
COOP200710	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It'd be	 uh... more fun if we had more time
to talk	 y'know?
COOP200713	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You're really good	 {NAME2}-kun! You really
just started playing?
COOP200714	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Guitar and bass go well together of course	
but it's also just... really fun to play
with you.
COOP200715	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Bassists are like the glue that holds a band
together. I'm jealous of your bandmates!
COOP200716	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Are you planning to perform for a school
festival or anything? If so	 I want to watch!
COOP200717	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Also...
COOP200718	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You're so... considerate when you play.
I noticed it with the tambourine	 too.
COOP200719	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It feels like you're really listening to me	
like you're ready to back up anything I play.
COOP200720	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Even when we were jamming just now	 I got
that feeling	 like you were looking out
for me...
COOP200722	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well... Our little sesh today confirmed it	
but I've had an inkling for a while.
COOP200724	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The fact that you can look me in the eye and
say that... Why am I the embarrassed one!?
COOP200725	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's no use playing dumb now! My ears
don't lie.
COOP200726	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh... Thank you...
COOP200727	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	How about we take a little break?
COOP200728	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm still working on writing that song.
It's going slow	 but it's going.
COOP200729	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sometimes when working on it	 Ryoko's words
pop up in my mind and it gives me writer's
block...
COOP200730	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But lately I've been thinking of other
things too. Like all the fun times we had
in the band.
COOP200731	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Or like the first time you talked to me.
Those kinds of memories.
COOP200732	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think this fun jam session that I had with
you today is gonna be one of those too.
COOP200733	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ryoko asked me to take her dreams and make
them come true. Maybe I should really do it.
COOP200734	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I don't know if that's what she really wants.
It might even end up bothering her.
COOP200735	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I'm not going to forget about our old
band	 no matter what.
COOP200736	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's the memories from that band that have
kept me going this whole time.
COOP200737	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Looking back	 this is all because you reached
out to me.
COOP200739	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And	 um... There's one more thing I want to
thank you for.
COOP200740	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Whether it be listening to it or singing it	
I've always found strength in music.
COOP200741	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think that's what drew me to it and made me
want to keep it in my life.
COOP200742	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I never really thought about why songs could
give me strength back then...
COOP200743	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But now that I'm writing my own lyrics	
I think I finally get it.
COOP200744	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	In a song	 you can say things you normally
can't to someone's face.
COOP200745	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You can just blurt out all the things you're
too uncertain or afraid to talk about.
COOP200746	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I think people don't even notice they
have things like that they want to say.
COOP200747	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So	 um... That's what I wanted to thank
you for.
COOP200748	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	When I'm with you	 I notice the things I want
to say	 the feelings I want to put into song.
COOP200749	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's like the dam holding back my thoughts
opens and the words come flooding out.
COOP200750	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	As if having you by my side suddenly turns
the voice of my heart into a song...
COOP200751	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry... It's just I find I want to say a
million things at once whenever I'm with
you	 so... um...
COOP200752	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Basically what I wanted to say was	
thank you for spending time with me.
COOP200753	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That's all	 really.
COOP200754	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ugh	 this is exactly the kind of thing that
would be easier to say in a song...
COOP200756	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Truth is though	 there is something that
I want to say to you even more	 or rather
ask you...
COOP200757	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So	 like...
COOP200758	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME2}-kun... How do you feel about me?
COOP200761	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You do? Oh	 uh... Okay.
COOP200762	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh.
COOP200763	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Then I'll keep working even harder! Just you
wait and see!
COOP200764	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks for today	 I think I'm gonna be able
to write some great lyrics after this.
COOP200765	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	How about we play one last song together	
before we call it for today?
COOP200767	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I-If that's true	 it makes me really happy...
COOP200768	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I	 um...
COOP200769	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've always thought	 I like being with you...
and I'd like to keep being with you too...
COOP200770	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Do you feel the same?
COOP200771	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200772	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Wow... I don't know what to say... Sorry	
I might get a li'l teary!
COOP200775	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Do you think we could stay here together a
little longer today?
COOP200776	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm feeling some really good lyrics coming on
right now	 so...
COOP200777	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'd like to keep going... With you...
COOP200803	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	*gasp*
COOP200804	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200805	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry for making you wait! You could've said
something earlier.
COOP200806	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	By the way	 I finished the lyrics for the new
song! The main melody is mostly done too.
COOP200807	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I thought I'd let you know right away if I
saw you today.
COOP200809	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks!
COOP200810	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm still figuring out some bits	 like the
outro and the chords leading into the chorus.
COOP200811	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Okay!
COOP200812	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I'm still figuring out some bits	 like
the outro and the chords leading into the chorus.
COOP200813	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME2}-kun	 let's go somewhere a bit
more private.
COOP200814	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ever since I started working on this song	
I've wanted you to be the first one to
hear it.
COOP200815	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	How about we go to our usual bench at
Inokashira Park?
COOP200817	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So	 what do you think? If you have any
comments or critiques	 I'd love to hear...
COOP200819	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you! I'm glad you like it... And kind
of relieved too.
COOP200820	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I haven't yet	 but... I do know what the song
is about	 that's for sure.
COOP200821	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I made this song for all the people who have
supported me until now.
COOP200822	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	There's Ryoko	 who got me into playing
music	 the folks who listened to my first
performance...
COOP200823	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Plus	 so many others who supported me and
helped me get to where I am right now	
singing my own songs.
COOP200824	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	This song is for all of them	 but most of
all	 it's for you	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP200825	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's because of you that I've been able to
keep going.
COOP200826	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Your presence even helped me come to
terms with this dream entrusted to me by
my friends.
COOP200827	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And now	 I feel like I can make that dream
happen myself.
COOP200828	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I want this song to convey all of those
feelings... but it's still just a rough
draft.
COOP200830	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	This is probably enough for just busking
with my guitar	 but I want it to sound more
polished...
COOP200831	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I also think having a solid rhythm would get
the point of the song across better.
COOP200832	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Even just adding a tambourine like you did
before would really change the song's impact.
COOP200834	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That'd be great! You could get your
bass and...
COOP200835	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 that could be good! Let's try it out!
COOP200836	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 but I guess it would be a pain to go pick
up your bass now...
COOP200837	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe we should do this another time?
COOP200839	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Shimokita? Oh	 where your school is...
Is there studio space we can use around
there?
COOP200840	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm fine with anywhere we can play together.
COOP200841	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Your advisor? Wait	 like for your school's
band club!?
COOP200842	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	W-Well	 I guess if they'd let us use your
club room that would solve our problem...
COOP200843	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	All right	 I might just take you up on that
offer. Thanks!
COOP200844	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've got all kinds of ideas to improve the
song going through my head right now...
COOP200845	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I want to try them out before I forget them!
COOP200846	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's kinda nerve-racking visiting a school I
don't go to...
COOP200847	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I'm glad your teacher gave us permission.
This seems like a great place to play.
COOP200848	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	My heart's racing just thinking of how we'll
be alone together in an empty classroom...
COOP200849	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But I'm glad your teacher gave us permission.
This seems like a great place to play.
COOP200850	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Better not let our time here go to waste!
Wanna get started?
COOP200852	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think that's pretty good! There's just a
few details left to adjust...
COOP200853	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm kind of surprised it went this quickly!
COOP200855	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 I'm looking forward to playing it for
real at the station square.
COOP200856	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We should debut the song together! I'll send
you a message then.
COOP200857	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks again for today. It was really fun!
COOP200858	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	When the song's done	 I'll let you know.
Get pumped!
COOP200860	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	When the song's done	 I'll let you know.
Get pumped!
COOP200861	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So	 uh	 {NAME2}-kun... You've got time after
this	 right?
COOP200862	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Uh	 I mean	 I don't have any plans or
anything	 so...
COOP200863	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I just thought	 I wouldn't mind	 y'know	
staying with you a bit longer...
COOP200900	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah	 {NAME2}-kun! I finished the song!
COOP200901	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'd really like you to play it with me for
the first performance	 so...
COOP200904	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Fantastic	 thank you! I'll be waiting
right here.
COOP200906	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I got an acoustic-electric guitar for this!
COOP200907	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe we should have done a proper
rehearsal first...
COOP200908	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But the bassline's the same as what we came
up with last time at your school.
COOP200909	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think you'll be able to pick it up
pretty fast.
COOP200911	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah. I always can.
COOP200912	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hehe	 don't worry. I know you can do it.
COOP200913	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Okay... How about we try it once with the
volume down?
COOP200914	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200915	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Perfect.
COOP200916	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think your playing has improved even more
since our last practice!
COOP200917	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	All right	 shall we then?
COOP200918	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Haha!
COOP200919	AAAAAA==	Ayaka-saaaan!
COOP200920	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey! Thanks for coming out today!
COOP200921	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We've got a new song to play for you today.
Just hold on while we get ready!
COOP200922	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've got a backing track with the drums and
things loaded on the keyboard.
COOP200923	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It'll start when I press the button.
You ready?
COOP200925	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I figured. Let's go!
COOP200926	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Glad I'm not the only one getting nervous...
Okay	 I'll count from five.
COOP200927	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Five... four... three... two...
COOP200928	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	One!
COOP200929	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	...Phew.
COOP200930	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Th-Thank you!
COOP200931	AAAAAA==	That was totes awesome! I didn't know you did
songs like that too	 Ayaka-san!
COOP200932	AAAAAA==	Do you have that song up online or something?
I wanna put it on repeat!
COOP200933	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No	 I haven't uploaded it anywhere...
I mean	 that was the first time we've played
it live	 so...
COOP200934	AAAAAA==	Seriously!? So this was	 like	 an exclusive
debut!? Damn	 I should've recorded it!
COOP200935	AAAAAA==	Ayaka-san! Play it again! Encore	 encore!
COOP200936	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah	 hehehe... Thank you!
COOP200937	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But first	 just give me a minute	 okay?
COOP200938	AAAAAA==	......
COOP200939	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME2}-kun.
COOP200940	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Could you just wait here? Just having you
here is enough. I'll be okay.
COOP200942	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks. I'll be back soon.
COOP200943	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah...
COOP200944	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ryoko... You stayed to listen?
COOP200945	AAAAAA==	I honestly didn't expect you to take what I
said to heart...
COOP200946	AAAAAA==	Thank you...
COOP200947	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No	 that's my line. Thank you	 Ryoko.
COOP200948	AAAAAA==	You've really changed	 Ayaka.
COOP200949	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Have I?
COOP200950	AAAAAA==	I think so. Though you're still the same
at heart.
COOP200951	AAAAAA==	Maybe it's because of that boy?
COOP200952	AAAAAA==	Keep at it	 Ayaka. I'll come to see you
play again.
COOP200953	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah. You hang in there too	 Ryoko.
COOP200954	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP200955	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	All right	 we're playing that song again	
then?
COOP200957	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	A toast to our new song's success!
COOP200958	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Cheers!
COOP200959	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	This spot is starting to feel like a second
home	 almost...
COOP200960	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So much has happened here... Like the first
time you listened to me sing.
COOP200961	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So much has happened here. Like the first
time you listened to me sing...
COOP200962	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And... the day we...
COOP200963	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I could say thank you a thousand times and it
still wouldn't feel like enough.
COOP200964	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Since meeting you	 I've become able to sing
on my own.
COOP200965	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And I'm not going to stop anytime soon.
COOP200966	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Next time I have a new song ready	 I'll be
sure you're the first to know.
COOP200967	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	And I hope you'll be the first to listen
to it	 too.
COOP200969	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah	 you'd better!
COOP200970	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	'Cause I'm going to make the best songs
I can!
COOP200971	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well... If I'm feeling down again	 I hope
you'll be there for me again.
COOP200972	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Until then	 I'll try making the best songs I
can on my own.
COOP200975	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm thinking about the next song I want to
write too.
COOP200976	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I can't seem to stop thinking of things I
want to sing when I'm with you...
COOP200978	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you. But actually...
COOP200979	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Something like that... But actually...
COOP200980	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I already have an idea for my next song.
COOP200981	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've got most of the lyrics down	 but I'm not
really sure about the melody.
COOP200982	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Do you think you could keep helping me with
my songwriting?
COOP200983	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We could do it here... or somewhere else...
COOP200985	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No matter what life throws at us	 let's stay
by each other's side forever.
COOP200902	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	AAAAAA==
COOP200905	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	AAAAAA==
COOP210000	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey	 so no pressure if you don't have
time	 but...
COOP210001	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Could we meet up now?
COOP210003	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Great! I'll wait for you at my usual spot.
COOP210005	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Got it. Lemme know if you feel like it
another time!
COOP210006	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey! Are you busy today?
COOP210007	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I was thinking of going somewhere and was
wondering if you'd like to come with.
COOP210009	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Really? I'm so happy to hear that!
COOP210010	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Let's get going then!
COOP210011	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 sorry. I guess it was kinda last minute.
Maybe another time?
COOP210100	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh man	 it's been so long since I've
been here!
COOP210101	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I used to come with my bandmates all
the time.
COOP210102	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We'd lose our voices screaming on all the
rides and then chat about music the whole
way home.
COOP210103	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But these days they're all busy and we can't
get our schedules to line up.
COOP210104	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Not that I don't also turn down my fair share
of invites from work and class...
COOP210105	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But... recently	 I've just had this urge to
come here again.
COOP210106	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm not sure why. Maybe because I've finally
made a new music friend?
COOP210107	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Anyway	 thanks for coming with me! What
should we try out first?
COOP210108	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 right	 I should mention I'm not great
with thrill rides...
COOP210110	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ooh... Sounds great! I can't even remember
the last time I went on a Ferris wheel!
COOP210111	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	What!? Okay... Just this one time.
COOP210112	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hahaha.
COOP210113	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey	 do you think we could do this again next
time you're free?
COOP210114	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I don't think one day is enough to try out
everything!
COOP210521	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Here we are again	 haha. What should we ride?
COOP210200	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry for dragging you out with me.
COOP210201	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I like it here	 though. It's quiet	 lots
of nature...
COOP210202	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It gets busy when the high schoolers come to
do the occasional cleaning for community
service	 though.
COOP210203	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sometimes	 I come here when I'm feeling down.
COOP210204	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Things have been kinda rough with college and
work lately...
COOP210205	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I mean	 it's nothing super serious	 don't
worry. Just a lot of minor things...
COOP210206	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But small problems can really weigh you down when they start to pile up.
COOP210207	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	At times like this	 I just wanna get away
from places that remind me of it all	 y'know?
COOP210209	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah. Hey	 thanks for that.
COOP210210	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Nah... It's reassuring to have someone by
my side.
COOP210211	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Inviting you was the right choice. Getting
lost in conversation helps me take a break
from my problems.
COOP210212	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey	 wanna take a loop around the park?
There's boats and a lot of different stuff.
COOP210213	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I know a really pretty area with benches	
too. It's my favorite spot.
COOP210214	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Plus	 different flowers bloom there every
season. I'm not sure what's out now...
COOP210215	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If you'd be up for it	 I'd love to come here
together again sometime.
COOP210216	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's nice and quiet here again today. What do
you wanna do?
COOP210300	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Heyyy! Look who it is! How've you been?
COOP210301	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry but the movie's gonna start soon...
I'll play with you next time	 okay?
COOP210302	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Bye bye!
COOP210303	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Sorry about that. I haven't seen that kitty
for a while	 so I had to...
COOP210304	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I come down to Yongen-Jaya a lot. The theater
here shows old movies sometimes.
COOP210305	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's pretty nice. The plots aren't overly
complicated	 and the classics have great
music too.
COOP210306	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's a cool feeling when you recognize a song
in the middle of the movie	 y'know?
COOP210307	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So which do you like more	 vintage films or
the more recent stuff?
COOP210309	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 that's perfect then!
COOP210310	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ah... Oh	 but I think you'll still be able to
appreciate this one!
COOP210311	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	They're showing an old movie that had a
remake come out just recently.
COOP210312	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think you'll enjoy it! Anyway	 it's
starting soon. How about we head in?
COOP210313	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So	 uh... Do you think you'd be interested
in coming to the movies with me again
sometime?
COOP210314	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I like these sorts of films	 so I come here
every so often.
COOP210315	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No obligation or anything! Just	 y'know...
If you feel like it.
COOP210316	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I wonder if there's anything interesting on
today... What are you in the mood for?
COOP210400	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Every now and then	 I'll get this huge
craving to see the ocean	 y'know? Just out
of the blue.
COOP210401	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I do like the beach too	 but I was more in
the mood for something like this today.
COOP210402	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Just listening to the sound of the waves is
so soothing...
COOP210403	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's always so pretty here.
COOP210404	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	During the day	 the sunlight dances off the
sea	 and at night you can see all the city
lights...
COOP210405	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's really... I dunno	 romantic?
COOP210406	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	What am I saying? Sorry	 I didn't mean to
sound all cheesy just then.
COOP210408	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Th-Thanks!
COOP210409	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Y-Yeah	 it is. Thanks... Sorry	 I made things
awkward all of a sudden.
COOP210410	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Say	 how about we take a stroll around?
COOP210411	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	There are some fun shops	 photo spots and a
whole load of other stuff around here.
COOP210412	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	They're all kinda difficult to go to on your
own	 y'know? So it'd be nice to go while I
have you here.
COOP210413	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's always so beautiful here. I feel like I
could just watch the waves forever...
COOP210500	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I SEE THE SEA!
COOP210501	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
COOP210502	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Don't you just get the urge to yell out at
the top of your lungs at a place like this?
COOP210503	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I really love the ocean.
COOP210504	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The smell of salt in the wind	 the sound of
waves	 the horizon stretching out forever...
COOP210505	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The only downside is that it's so far away
from Shibuya!
COOP210506	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm glad we could come here today.
COOP210508	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No	 thank you! Really.
COOP210509	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Then let's get something to eat!
COOP210510	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	There's supposed to be a lot of good food
around here	 but I've never tried any.
COOP210511	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Since we came all the way out here	 let's
treat ourselves! I just got my paycheck	 too!
COOP210512	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hey...
COOP210513	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	So could we come here together again? Maybe
every once in a while even?
COOP210514	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Being here alone is okay	 but... it's
definitely more fun with you.
COOP210515	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I SEE THE SEA! Hehe!
COOP210602	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh? Y-You're giving this to me? Really!?
COOP210603	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you. I love it!
COOP210604	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	No way	 you're serious!? I've been wanting
one of these!
COOP210605	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You're saying I can have it? I... am...
That's... uh...
COOP210606	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I... I'm so happy	 I'm lost for words...
But seriously... Thank you!
COOP210700	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	 are you free now?
COOP210701	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If you have time	 I was thinking it'd be fun
to jam together again.
COOP210703	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Awesome! I'll be waiting at my usual spot.
COOP210705	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh too bad. I'm in Shibuya today	 so let me know
if you find the time!
COOP210706	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
COOP210707	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	If you have time	 I was thinking it'd be fun
to jam together again...
COOP210708	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I feel like taking it easy indoors today	 though.
Know any good places?
COOP210710	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Wait	 as in your house!?
COOP210711	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	N-Now that you mention it	 th-that does sound
kinda nice. Yeah...
COOP210713	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	S-Sorry	 no can do! My place is tiny and a
huge mess! M-Maybe another time‚Äîafter I
clean...
COOP210714	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks again for inviting me...
COOP210715	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Really nice place you've got here...
It's really clean	 and uh...
COOP210717	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	R-Right	 yeah! Thanks!
COOP210718	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	N-N-No	 n-not at all! I'm just a little	 uh	
tense...
COOP210719	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've	 uh	 never actually been over to a guy's
house before... Hahaha...
COOP210720	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Plus	 I don't think I've played at someone
else's place since high school band practice.
COOP210721	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	We'd go to one of the band member's houses
and jam out until their folks got home.
COOP210722	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	 you said your parents were out
on a trip somewhere?
COOP210723	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I guess I can stay over as late as we
want	 then!
COOP210725	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 uh	 that's... very generous of you	
thanks...
COOP210726	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Yeah! How many songs do you think we'll get
through?
COOP210727	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Well then	 shall we get started?
COOP210728	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	My fingers are itching to play something
already!
COOP210729	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thanks for having me over again. Hehe!

COOP240770	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP200000	AAAAAA==	Now that I'm in the band club	
that girl with the guitar
keeps grabbing my attention...
COOP200001	AAAAAA==	It could be worth hearing
her play...
COOP200002	AAAAAA==	Go listen|Listen another time
COOP200004	AAAAAA==	I decided to leave the area.
COOP200005	AAAAAA==	She hasn't started performing
yet. It looks like she's
missing something...
COOP200006	AAAAAA==	It's some kind of
official document...
COOP200007	AAAAAA==	Ayaka Sakai is written in
the name field...
COOP200009	AAAAAA==	Are you Ayaka Sakai?|Sorry	 can I ask your name?
COOP200015	AAAAAA==	What's the paper for?|Are you doing a show?
COOP200024	AAAAAA==	You must like music a lot.|I wanted to hear you.|What were you gonna play?
COOP200028	AAAAAA==	So Ayaka used to be in a band...
COOP200029	AAAAAA==	Maybe if I could hear her
play	 I'd learn something
useful for the band club...
COOP200030	AAAAAA==	I told her how I just joined
the band club at school and
want to learn from her.
COOP200042	AAAAAA==	Sure thing.|I want to hear you next time.
COOP200045	AAAAAA==	I told her my name.
COOP200049	AAAAAA==	We exchanged contact info.
COOP200050	AAAAAA==	Spending time with Ayaka	
I feel hope rising
within me...
COOP200103	AAAAAA==	Sure.|Now's not a good time...
COOP200107	AAAAAA==	Ayaka started strumming...
COOP200108	AAAAAA==	Her tone is so clear... Nobody
at band club could hold a
candle to her!
COOP200109	AAAAAA==	But...
COOP200110	AAAAAA==	There was no reaction to her
performance. It was as if they
didn't hear it at all.
COOP200113	AAAAAA==	It looks like the crowd's
indifference really
demoralized her...
COOP200116	AAAAAA==	Don't give up so easily.|I want to hear more.
COOP200132	AAAAAA==	Something's off with Ayaka...
COOP200133	AAAAAA==	You okay?|You don't look so good.
COOP200138	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's still looking faint.
She probably shouldn't
push herself.
COOP200139	AAAAAA==	Your health is more important.|There's always tomorrow.
COOP200145	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200203	AAAAAA==	Sure.|Now's not a good time...
COOP200209	AAAAAA==	She doesn't look so good...
COOP200210	AAAAAA==	Maybe she's sleep-deprived?
COOP200211	AAAAAA==	Something wrong?|Did you sleep last night?
COOP200214	AAAAAA==	Looks like it might be a good idea to call off
busking today too...
COOP200215	AAAAAA==	I asked her if there was anything that was
stressing her out.
COOP200224	AAAAAA==	Why did she walk away?|Creative differences?
COOP200237	AAAAAA==	This problem runs deeper than
I thought.
COOP200238	AAAAAA==	I think Ayaka needs some
motivation to find
her courage...
COOP200241	AAAAAA==	There's no rush.|I'm happy to help anytime.
COOP200246	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200303	AAAAAA==	I'll find you a place to play.|All right	 another time then.
COOP200307	AAAAAA==	Of course.|I might know a place...
COOP200308	AAAAAA==	I told her about the band club
practicing at Inokashira Park.
COOP200311	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I headed to
Inokashira Park together.
COOP200314	AAAAAA==	I want to hear your song.|You can practice here.
COOP200320	AAAAAA==	Ayaka started singing...
COOP200321	AAAAAA==	Although her nerves caused her voice to
shake	 her singing was so captivating!
COOP200323	AAAAAA==	Your voice is beautiful.|Were you nervous?
COOP200326	AAAAAA==	She's being modest. Both her singing and
guitar playing were mesmerizing.
COOP200327	AAAAAA==	It didn't sound like your first.|You've never performed live?
COOP200337	AAAAAA==	What would help you to sing?|Is there anything I can do?
COOP200341	AAAAAA==	That reminds me...
COOP200348	AAAAAA==	Let's think of something else.|Try to loosen up...
COOP200353	AAAAAA==	Booyah!|Ready	 set	 go!|Here... we... GO!
COOP200359	AAAAAA==	Ayaka looks more happier than ever.
Getting through a song must've
boosted her confidence.
COOP200362	AAAAAA==	I know you can.|I'm looking forward to it!
COOP200364	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200366	AAAAAA==	Afterwards	 we had a heated
discussion about music for
a while.
COOP200367	AAAAAA==	I'll find you a place to play.|Can you play somewhere else?
COOP200402	AAAAAA==	Sure.|Sorry	 I won't be in the area...
COOP200406	AAAAAA==	Booyah!|Ready	 set	 go!|Here... we... GO!
COOP200416	AAAAAA==	I have a trick up my sleeve...|Guess what I brought.
COOP200420	AAAAAA==	I borrowed it from school.|Let's jam!
COOP200425	AAAAAA==	Is this good?|I'll set the rhythm.
COOP200438	AAAAAA==	The atmosphere really changed
once Ayaka started singing!
COOP200439	AAAAAA==	But she's so absorbed in
the song	 I can't tell if
she's noticed...
COOP200446	AAAAAA==	Isn't that Ayaka's friend? How long has she
been here?
COOP200448	AAAAAA==	It was a good song.|You really did!
COOP200457	AAAAAA==	I want to hear another too.|What's the next song?
COOP200459	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's voice reverberated
throughout Shibuya Station
Square...
COOP200470	AAAAAA==	What are you waiting for?|Play it next time you busk!
COOP200475	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200500	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's performing alone...
COOP200501	AAAAAA==	Go listen|Stop by another time
COOP200502	AAAAAA==	I decided to leave the area.
COOP200504	AAAAAA==	Looks like Ayaka spotted me...
COOP200507	AAAAAA==	You sounded good.|You did great on your own!
COOP200514	AAAAAA==	Your message.|A catchy melody.|Both are important.
COOP200523	AAAAAA==	What do you want to say most?|Just keep trying stuff out.|Who are your songs for?
COOP200538	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200539	AAAAAA==	Afterwards	 I watched the rest
of Ayaka's performance before
saying goodbye...
COOP200601	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's just standing there
with her guitar. She looks
kind of down...
COOP200602	AAAAAA==	Say something|Just let her be
COOP200604	AAAAAA==	I decided to leave the area.
COOP200605	AAAAAA==	She definitely seems to be
feeling down...
COOP200606	AAAAAA==	Did something happen?|Not feeling well?
COOP200625	AAAAAA==	You didn't do anything wrong.|Is that all you want to say to her?|What do you want to do?
COOP200634	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I visited
Inokashira Park together.
COOP200635	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's singing sounds more
sorrowful than usual...
COOP200639	AAAAAA==	Can I request a song?|Teach me to play guitar!
COOP200647	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200648	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I parted ways
after having a chill hangout
together.
COOP200701	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's standing alone looking
at her phone. It seems like
something's on her mind...
COOP200702	AAAAAA==	Say something|Just let her be
COOP200704	AAAAAA==	I decided to leave the area.
COOP200711	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I visited my school.
COOP200712	AAAAAA==	After picking up my bass	
we headed to Inokashira Park.
COOP200721	AAAAAA==	You got me.|Dunno what you mean...
COOP200723	AAAAAA==	I wanna hear you play at your best.|You must be imagining things.|I just want to cheer you up.
COOP200738	AAAAAA==	You're welcome.|It was just a coincidence.|I'm glad we met.
COOP200755	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Ayaka
growing deeper...
COOP200759	AAAAAA==	I should choose my next
words carefully...
COOP200760	AAAAAA==	I support you as a fan.|I feel the same way you do.
COOP200766	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I parted ways after
jamming out together.
COOP200773	AAAAAA==	I am now in a relationship
with Ayaka...
COOP200774	AAAAAA==	There's no turning back now...
COOP200778	AAAAAA==	When we played this time	 it felt like our
hearts were truly in sync.
COOP200790	AAAAAA==	I should choose my next
words carefully...
COOP200791	AAAAAA==	I support you as a fan.|I feel the same way you do.
COOP200800	AAAAAA==	Ayaka's busking today...
COOP200801	AAAAAA==	Go listen|Say hi another time
COOP200802	AAAAAA==	I decided to leave the area.
COOP200808	AAAAAA==	Congrats!|I wanna hear!
COOP200816	AAAAAA==	As Ayaka strummed a
melancholic melody	 I could
feel the warmth in her voice.
COOP200818	AAAAAA==	It's a wonderful song.|Have you picked a title?
COOP200829	AAAAAA==	It didn't sound rough to me.|What are you planning to add?
COOP200833	AAAAAA==	I'll help rearrange it	 then.|Want to add a bass part?
COOP200838	AAAAAA==	We could go to Shimo-Kitazawa...|I'll ask our advisor.
COOP200851	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I worked out a bass
part for her original song.
COOP200854	AAAAAA==	It's really coming together.|Can't wait to hear it live.
COOP200859	AAAAAA==	I walked Ayaka to the station.
COOP200864	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I spent some time
alone together...
COOP200903	AAAAAA==	I'll go get my bass.|I need a bass.
COOP200910	AAAAAA==	You can count on me.|I'm not so sure...
COOP200924	AAAAAA==	Ready when you are.|Let's count down.
COOP200941	AAAAAA==	Go ahead.|I'm sure she'll understand.
COOP200956	AAAAAA==	We gave the audience their
encore and played Ayaka's
new song again.
COOP200968	AAAAAA==	I look forward to it.|Do you need help?
COOP200973	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Ayaka...
COOP200974	AAAAAA==	After our little celebration	
I walked Ayaka to the station
and said goodbye...
COOP200977	AAAAAA==	I look forward to it.|Do you need help?
COOP200984	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Ayaka...
COOP200986	AAAAAA==	We headed back to the
station discussing ideas for
our next song...
COOP210002	AAAAAA==	That's fine.|Let me rethink this.
COOP210004	AAAAAA==	Sounds like Ayaka wants to
meet up. I should head
over now.
COOP210008	AAAAAA==	I'm in.|Now's not a good time...
COOP210012	AAAAAA==	We should go there
another time...
COOP210109	AAAAAA==	How about the Ferris wheel?|Give the roller coaster a go!
COOP210115	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I explored the
amusement park. We took in the
view from the Ferris wheel.

COOP400002	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	There's a place I want to visit	 but I
thought it'd be more fun with you.
COOP400003	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400003]	Sure.|Now's not a good time...
COOP400004	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm glad to hear that! Truth is	 I spent all
morning thinking about how to invite you.
COOP400005	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	All right! Let's get going!
COOP400006	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I see... Let's go together when you're free.
COOP400010	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	This is where just about everyone meets up	
isn't it?
COOP400011	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Since the bar's in Shibuya	 I actually pass
by this area just about every day.
COOP400012	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But that also makes it feel like I'm on my
way to work	 so I try not to hang out here
much.
COOP400013	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I mean	 what if I run into a regular or
something? That'd totally take the wind out
of my sails on a day off...
COOP400014	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'd probably just want to go home and sleep
if that happened. Or find somewhere to drink
near my place...
COOP400015	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400015]	I'll show you around.|Let's hang out together.
COOP400016	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 how chivalrous of you. So this garden-y
area...
COOP400017	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	There are lots of high schoolers around in
the day	 huh? I guess they're on their way
home.
COOP400018	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Yeah	 I think if I'm with you	 it won't feel
as much like I'm on my way to work.
COOP400019	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You seem to know Shibuya well	 {NAME2}-kun.
Maybe we should hang out here together more
often?
COOP400020	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400020]	We can meet every day!|Let's get going!
COOP400021	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I like that enthusiasm! It's got me feeling
excited too!
COOP400022	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	All right then	 give me the full tour! I'd
love to get to know Shibuya better.
COOP400023	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I like us meeting here. It really feels like
we're in Tokyo	 y'know?
COOP400040	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	This area's pretty much my backyard!
COOP400041	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I stop by for a few drinks when I have time	
so I know all the bars here.
COOP400042	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Unlike ours	 many of them don't let minors
in	 though...
COOP400043	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Not too many places I can take you to	 huh?
COOP400044	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400044]	That's too bad.|I can wait.
COOP400045	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hey	 if you manage to live till eighty	 that
means you'll be able to drink for the next
sixty years of your life!
COOP400046	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So you should cherish not getting hangovers
and stuff while you can	 hehehe.
COOP400047	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Yeah. That's the right attitude	 young man.
COOP400048	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Life's better sometimes when you don't rush
into things.
COOP400049	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I love drinking. It's a pastime I enjoy
very much.
COOP400050	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That being said	 I've also made a lot of
mistakes when I'm drunk...
COOP400051	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Like	 take that bar over there	 for example.
COOP400052	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I got drunk there once and was in such a good
mood that I picked up everyone else's tabs...
COOP400053	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You can imagine how shocked I was the next
morning to find my wallet empty!
COOP400054	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400054]	I'll go with you next time.|I can watch out for you.
COOP400055	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I told you I can't bring along a minor!
COOP400056	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But thanks. I appreciate you saying that.
COOP400057	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Now then	 how does dinner somewhere other
than a bar sound?
COOP400058	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	There'll be no alcohol while I'm strolling
around here with you!
COOP400070	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	AAAAAA==
COOP400071	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wow... That was beautiful! Thanks for tagging
along	 by the way.
COOP400072	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I've always wanted to come	 but a
planetarium's not the easiest place to visit
on your own.
COOP400073	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400073]	Why'd you want to go there?|Do you like stars?
COOP400074	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 I was wondering if I could make a
cocktail or mocktail themed around stars.
COOP400075	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Of course	 a drink has to taste good	 but it
has to look presentable as well.
COOP400076	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I want to make a drink that satisfies even
before you put your lips to the glass.
COOP400077	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So	 {NAME2}-kun. Any cool ideas for the
drink?
COOP400078	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400078]	Star-shaped ice cubes.|Colors like the night sky.
COOP400079	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That shouldn't be too hard to pull off!
COOP400080	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	They do sell ice trays shaped like stars	
right?
COOP400081	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I could even use fruit juice for the ice
cubes or something!
COOP400082	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 that's a good one. It'll be a challenge	
that's for sure.
COOP400083	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I guess I could mix in layers of blue and
purple to create a gradient like that.
COOP400084	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Maybe I'll throw in some kind of star
decoration around the rim to make it cuter
too.
COOP400085	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I came here to look for inspiration today	
but I didn't expect it to be this much fun!
COOP400086	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wanna come here again?
COOP400087	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400087]	Of course.|Anytime.
COOP400088	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks! I'll hold you to it	 then!
COOP400089	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I wonder if they're showing anything cool
today... Any constellations you wanna keep an
eye out for?
COOP400100	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I come here whenever I feel down.
COOP400101	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	When I'm somewhere up high	 my worries just
seem to melt away.
COOP400102	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Like	 all my problems feel so miniscule from
up here	 you know?
COOP400103	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	By the way... Today will be the first time
I've ridden this with someone else!
COOP400104	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe	 how do you feel about getting to be the
first person to share a gondola with me?
COOP400105	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400105]	I'm honored.|I'd love to do this again.
COOP400106	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Haha. Thanks!
COOP400107	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Really though	 the honor's all mine.
COOP400108	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The scenery looks all different. Maybe it's
because you're here...
COOP400109	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So...
COOP400110	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Now that I've learned how fun it is to ride
with someone else...
COOP400111	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	...I hope you'll come here with me again. You
were the one who taught me	 after all.
COOP400112	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Great! Let's enjoy the view!
COOP400113	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Are you excited to look down on the world
from high up again today? Let's do this!
COOP400130	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Truth is	 I've never made monja myself
before.
COOP400131	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm sure I'll figure it out. I've seen how
others do it!
COOP400132	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Three	 two	 one... Here I go!
COOP400133	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hup! Wait	 what? That's not how it's supposed
to go...
COOP400134	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh no! The liquid's seeping through! Aaaah!

COOP400137	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks	 {NAME2}-kun. I knew I could count
on you!
COOP400138	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Show me how you do it!
COOP400139	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Whoa! You fixed it in no time flat!
COOP400140	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wh-Where did you learn to do this!?
COOP400141	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wow	 {NAME2}-kun! This monja's perfect!
COOP400142	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400142]	I'm your monja mentor.|Nothing but the best for you.
COOP400143	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	My monja mentor	 huh? That does sound pretty
cool!
COOP400144	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hey	 don't you dare go around thinking you've
one-upped me	 or you'll regret it!
COOP400145	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Remember	 you gotta treat me like a lady!
COOP400146	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 it looks like it's cooked through.
COOP400153	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Let's go ahead and eat Chef {NAME2}'s monja!
COOP400147	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Sometimes chowing down on some monja just
really hits the spot	 y'know?
COOP400162	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Did you pick this out yourself? I really	
really like it!
COOP400163	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I can tell you put a lot of thought
into this.
COOP400164	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm so happy. Thank you. But you can bet
I'll be giving you something just as good
in return!
COOP400165	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 a present for me?
COOP400166	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	What a lovely surprise! Thanks!
COOP400180	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hey there	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400181	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I just came up with a great mocktail recipe.
Thing is	 it might have too many steps to
make at the bar...
COOP400182	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I want to take my time and do it justice	
so can I make it at your place?
COOP400183	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400183]	Sure	 come over anytime.|It's a bit soon for that...

all we're doing	 okay!?
COOP400187	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 sorry	 I didn't realize it was a big deal

COOP400189	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400189]	You okay?|Is it mocktail time?
COOP400190	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Truth is	 the mocktail stuff was mostly just
an excuse.
COOP400191	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I-I mean	 I couldn't very well just be like
Hey, can I come over?
COOP400192	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It'd be weird!
COOP400193	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It'd sound like I wanted something more...
Or give you the wrong idea...
COOP400194	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Especially when all I wanted was to see what
your place looked like..
COOP400195	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400195]	Would that idea have been so wrong?|Was that really all you wanted?
COOP400196	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Okay	 that was almost too smooth. Are you
sure you're younger than me?
COOP400197	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Sometimes I feel like you've got me dancing
in the palm of your hand...
COOP400198	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 no	 not really...
COOP400199	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I	 um	 wanted to spend some quality time with
you as well.
COOP400200	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh wait	 you said your parents are out of the
country now	 right?
COOP400201	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Which means... it's just us here. We're...
alone!?
COOP400202	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	T-Time out for a sec! Let's save that for
another time	 okay?
COOP400203	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Ahem! Gotta pull myself together... I brought
everything I need for the mocktails.
COOP400204	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So it'd be a shame not to make some together.

start...

COOP400321	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Flair bartending is the art of making drinks
while performing like this.
COOP400322	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You might think a bartender just has to shake
up a mixer	 but not always!
COOP400323	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Sometimes bartending needs more oomph.

like!
COOP400352	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The owner may not be around all that much	
but they want to welcome customers who have
to leave out the liquor too.
COOP400353	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's why we serve mocktails‚Äîso that minors
and nondrinkers can enjoy the atmosphere
here.
COOP400354	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hey	 if I can ask a favor	 would you like to
be my mocktail taste-tester?
COOP400355	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I've been trying my hand at a bunch	 but
could use a second opinion... Most people
here only order alcohol	 you see.
COOP400356	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	H-How about it? Wait	 I'll even throw in the
recipes for you so you can make them at home!
COOP400357	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Really? Thank you!
COOP400359	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'll do my best to make some impressive
mocktails for you	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400360	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	And of course	 I'll have some new tricks to
show you	 too! Look forward to it.
COOP400400	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Welcome. Oh	 it's you! Glad to see you again	
{NAME2}-kun.
COOP400401	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400401]	I could do with a drink.|I have plans today...
COOP400402	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Feel free to come by anytime. I'll be
waiting.
COOP400403	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Come right in and take a seat. What should I
make you today?
COOP400404	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks for waiting!
COOP400405	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400405]	The colors are so beautiful.|Looks delicious.|Can I take a picture?
COOP400406	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thank you! I try hard to create nice
gradients like this.
COOP400407	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Did the colors get your appetite going? It
tastes as good as it looks too! ...Probably.
COOP400408	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Of course! I'm sure it'll look amazing on
your socials. Make sure the bottle's in the
shot!
COOP400409	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Today's mocktail is called a Shirley Temple.
The name makes it sound like the real deal	
doesn't it?
COOP400410	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Let me tell you a bit about it!
COOP400411	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's made with grenadine	 or pomegranate
syrup for the base	 and then you pour ginger
ale on top.
COOP400412	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Finally	 garnish with a lime and you're done!
It's about as classic a mocktail as they
come.
COOP400413	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You just give it a little stir once it's all
in the glass. It should be easy for you to
make at home too.
COOP400414	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The fundamentals are important	 you know? The
owner here kept saying that when I was new.
COOP400415	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400415]	Why'd you become a bartender?|When'd you start training?
COOP400416	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 it's a little embarrassing...
COOP400417	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I wasn't really much of a cocktail enthusiast
back then	 but I'd had a somewhat frustrating
day...
COOP400418	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So I told myself I'd drink my troubles away	
and wandered right into a bar.
COOP400419	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I was ready to chug down whatever they put
in front of me	 but what I got tasted
incredible.
COOP400420	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's when I developed an interest in liquor
itself.
COOP400421	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The bartender that day put on a real show
before handing me my drink.
COOP400422	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The way the bottles flew through the air and
those graceful movements... I was mesmerized
and pretty soon became a regular.
COOP400423	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I was a college student then and wasn't
thinking much about my future...
COOP400424	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Once I needed to find a job	 I started
wondering if I could make drinks like that.
COOP400425	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So I applied to become a bartender and
started learning! That bartender I saw then
is the owner here.
COOP400426	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm still nowhere near that level	 but I want
to make others feel the way I did that day.
COOP400427	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hahaha. Saying this all out loud really is
embarrassing	 huh!
COOP400428	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400428]	It's a great story.|Your dream came true.
COOP400429	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe	 thank you.
COOP400431	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	How about we go for round two? I'll make you
something a little different.
COOP400460	AAAAAA==	C'mon	 Yumi-chan! Show me that trick you
always do!
COOP400461	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe! All right	 if that's what you want!

You're the best	 Yumi-chan!
COOP400465	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe	 thanks. Oh	 {NAME2}-kun. Welcome.
COOP400466	AAAAAA==	I love watching Yumi-chan move. It's like
she's really dancing back there!
COOP400467	AAAAAA==	How do I put it? Her flair just seems so...
elegant. She's mesmerizing.
COOP400468	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400468]	Agreed.|She's captivating.
COOP400469	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Really	 you two? Flattery's not gonna get you
anywhere with me	 okay?
COOP400470	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Anyway	 want one more	 Rina-chan?
COOP400471	AAAAAA==	Oh	 you know I do! But I have somewhere to be
after this. Maybe next time!
COOP400472	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks for coming by today. I know you just
 saw some flair	 but I want to show you
something else.
COOP400473	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's a move I wanted to show you the next
time you came by.
COOP400474	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Aaaand	 here you go!
COOP400475	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Ah	 you noticed? That's right	 I added a
little step to the sequence there.
COOP400476	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's cramped behind the counter	 but good
footwork opens up so many possibilities.
COOP400477	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400477]	You've got some great moves.|It's like watching a dancer.
COOP400478	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You're a perceptive one	 {NAME2}-kun!
COOP400479	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's right. I incorporated more dance
elements into my flair.
COOP400480	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You see	 I used to be in the dance club back
when I was in college.
COOP400481	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Let's see... I should have some videos on my
phone.
COOP400482	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Ah	 this is from when I went to a competition
with my club. Here I am.
COOP400484	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Our club did all kinds of dances. This one
was a belly dancing competition.
COOP400485	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	We all had to wear matching outfits and
practice until we were in perfect sync.
COOP400486	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400486]	Such light footwork.|The outfit is beautiful.|You look like a pro.
COOP400487	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 those steps were a pain. It took sooo
much practice to make them look good.
COOP400488	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Right? I even sewed on those accessories
myself to accent the green shades of the
dress.
COOP400489	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Aww	 you're going to make me blush! I didn't
want to ruin the mood by smiling.
COOP400490	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's great to hear feedback on my dancing
too. It's been a while since I've even shown
this to anyone.
COOP400491	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks for watching	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400493	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I started dancing because I heard it helps
you keep in shape	 but I just had so much
fun.
COOP400494	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'd try my hand at every dance I could find.
It was all I could think about back then...
COOP400495	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Those times were such a blast...
COOP400496	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	O-Oh! Sorry! You must be bored hearing me
drone on and on about myself.
COOP400497	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Mocktails! Yeah	 let's talk about mocktails!
COOP400498	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I was thinking of making you one more. What
do you want? Anything's on the menu for
today!
COOP400499	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Any flavors or colors you'd fancy? That's the
best place to start.
COOP400500	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Roger that! In that case	 I'll use this	
a little of that	 and...
COOP400520	AAAAAA==	Hmph! Upsy... daisy!

COOP400525	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 this? The guy we have deliver drinks and
other supplies took the day off.
COOP400526	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I thought I'd at least buy what we need for
today	 but I guess I got too much.
COOP400527	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400527]	Need some help?|I'll carry some.
COOP400528	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wait	 really? This stuff is pretty heavy

COOP400529	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You'd be willing to help carry some of this
for me?
COOP400530	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Phew	 that should do it! Thanks so much for
helping out	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400531	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You sure it wasn't too heavy? It felt like my
arms were about to fall off.
COOP400532	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400532]	Not really.|A little	 yeah.|It was light as a feather.
COOP400533	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Seriously? Wow	 I guess young guys like you
are pretty strong...
COOP400534	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I knew it. Still	 thanks for carrying it all
the way here.
COOP400535	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Haha! I guess even you make jokes every now
and then	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400536	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Okay! Let me make you a drink. Consider it
thanks for the help.
COOP400537	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks for waiting! Today's mocktail is a
peach tea.
COOP400538	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400538]	Just tea?|Peach tea's a mocktail?
COOP400539	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So long as it looks like a cocktail and it's
non-alcoholic	 it's a mocktail!
COOP400540	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	At least	 that's how I see it. Look	 it's
even got some garnishing like cocktails do!
COOP400541	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I thought you'd like something refreshing
after working up a sweat. Come on	 try it.
COOP400542	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe	 judging by your face	 that was right up
your alley	 huh?
COOP400543	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Let me tell you a bit about it!
COOP400544	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You just add iced tea to some peach syrup and
stir! Yup! It's that easy!
COOP400545	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Then again	 I did put a bit of extra syrup at
the base to make it more like a cocktail.
COOP400546	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I also added the garnish on the brim of the
glass. Layers really do help make a drink
pop.
COOP400547	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm the kind of gal who needs a sweet
pick-me-up when I'm tired	 so I made it a
little sweeter.
COOP400548	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But when I'm exhausted	 I'll sometimes switch
the flavor up with some jasmine tea.
COOP400549	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You can also use rooibos tea instead of
black tea as another variation.
COOP400550	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm sure you'll be able to come up with your
own takes on the recipe	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400552	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So yeah	 that's the recipe. Oh	 right.
COOP400553	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Since you're here	 want something to eat?
I could make you some pasta with those
groceries we carried here.

another recipe for you.
COOP400592	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Haha	 right? Even if you're just mixing
ingredients	 nailing the proportions can be
tough!

COOP400609	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks	 {NAME2}-kun. You're a really kind

COOP400610	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So you noticed how I felt and managed to put
together a drink to lift my mood?
COOP400611	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Looks like you could be a bartender yourself	
kid! Just kidding.
COOP400612	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Still	 I really appreciate this.
COOP400614	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	For you to grasp my emotions so easily

COOP400615	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Those customers earlier... they were saying
that I could become a dancer.

COOP400654	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's not like the owner was telling me to
enter this or anything...
COOP400655	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But it feels like he's expecting big things
from me	 you know? Leaving this here and all.
COOP400656	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400656]	Feeling nervous?|You have the skills for it.
COOP400657	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 how do I put it? I do like flair
bartending and coming up with recipes	 but...
COOP400658	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Do you mind if I sit next to you?
COOP400659	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So	 I mentioned before how I used to enjoy
dancing	 right? Well	 I got really into it.
COOP400660	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I didn't care about getting in shape or
anything back then. I just wanted to have fun
and make friends.
COOP400661	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's one flimsy motivation	 I know. But I
think that's why I could keep at it.
COOP400662	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The club itself was pretty chill too. More of
a "let's enjoy dance" vibe than anything.
COOP400663	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	We did enter competitions but we didn't care
about winning or losing.
COOP400664	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	We just saw it as our chance to practice and
show off what we could do.
COOP400665	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The results didn't matter‚Äîalthough we sure
worked our butts off to perfect our moves.
COOP400666	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But then	 one day...
COOP400667	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	We were in some competition	 and then someone
in the audience complained about me.
COOP400668	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I made a mistake I'd made in a previous
competition	 and I guess that made him blow
his top.
COOP400669	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I got told that I must not have been taking
it seriously	 that I shouldn't be repeating
the same mistakes.
COOP400670	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He kept complaining on and on	 even though
I was just dancing for fun.
COOP400671	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But this guy... I guess he got obsessed?
He kept coming to events to criticize me.
COOP400672	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He had his own image of how I should dance	
then whined when I let him down. I couldn't
stand it.
COOP400673	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He's the reason why dancing stopped being fun
for me.
COOP400675	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	All the fun had been sucked out of it	 so I
wanted to drink my worries away... and ended
up here.
COOP400676	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I quit dancing... But I'd found a new joy in
bartending.
COOP400677	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	AAAAAA==
COOP400678	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Sorry about that. I ended up going on another
heavy tangent...
COOP400679	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Long story short	 I guess you can say
competing isn't really my thing.
COOP400680	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I like it when others watch me	 but not when
they judge me. So maybe this tournament isn't
for me.
COOP400681	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400681]	Thanks for telling me all that.|Sorry to dredge that up.|It wasn't your fault.
COOP400682	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	No	 thank you for listening.
COOP400683	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	No	 it's okay. It's all in the past now and
it's not that serious anyway.
COOP400684	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hearing that from you makes me feel a little
better.
COOP400685	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Actually	 you might be the first person I've
told all that to. Wow	 that's kinda
embarrassing!
COOP400687	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Okay! Time to prepare you another mocktail as

when you're free.
COOP400703	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	And that's how you do it. What do you think?
Hope you'll try this one out yourself.
COOP400704	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hi there	 welcome...
COOP400705	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	...!?
COOP400706	AAAAAA==	Heh. No other customers today	 huh?
COOP400707	AAAAAA==	Fine by me. Hey	 gimme my usual. Chop-chop.
COOP400708	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I-I'm sorry	 sir... I believe you've been
told that you're banned from this store.
COOP400709	AAAAAA==	Banned!? Maybe according to you	 but who died
and put you in charge!?
COOP400710	AAAAAA==	There's no law keeping me from coming here!

COOP400715	AAAAAA==	Ugh	 isn't this supposed to be a bar? When'd
it turn into a soda fountain for kids?
COOP400716	AAAAAA==	Didn't you hear me	 lady? I told you to make
me my usual!
COOP400717	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	S-Sir! I told you you're...
COOP400718	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400718]	Door's right over there.|Do I need to call the cops?
COOP400719	AAAAAA==	Fine. I'll leave for today.
COOP400720	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm sorry about that	 {NAME2}-kun...
COOP400721	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's the guy. The one who made me quit
dancing.
COOP400722	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Back when I had graduated college	 given up
dancing	 and just started to enjoy my
bartending training... 
COOP400723	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	...he found out that I worked here and
started coming by all the time.
COOP400724	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I could only do simple flair tricks back
then	 so he'd always complain about that.
COOP400725	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He'd even bring up how other stores had
better cocktails. It was awful.
COOP400726	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The owner was pretty quick to ban him though.
I thought he wouldn't come back...
COOP400727	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm sorry. You took the time to come here	
and now I'm talking to you about my life
story again.
COOP400728	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That must've been scary for you. He looked
ready to snap at any moment.
COOP400729	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400729]	I'm fine.|Are you okay?|That guy's a pain.
COOP400730	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You're one tough kid	 you know that? Thanks	
I feel a lot better now.
COOP400731	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Me? I'm... If I'm being honest	 I was
terrified.
COOP400732	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You said it. We told him he's banned	 but
that didn't do a lick of good.
COOP400733	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thank you. I would've been too afraid to do
anything on my own.
COOP400734	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm so glad you were here with me	
{NAME2}-kun.
COOP400736	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I should tell the owner about this. I just
hope it doesn't lead to any trouble.
COOP400737	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's not like the police will help if all
he's done is enter the store.
COOP400738	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Everything worked out okay because you were
here	 but what if he comes again?
COOP400739	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Maybe I should just give up... on
everything...
COOP400740	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That might make things easier for me...
COOP400741	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	*sigh*

COOP400746	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Y-You're not planning on doing anything
dangerous	 are you?
COOP400747	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Okay... Well	 he'd always lambaste other
dancers before he got obsessed with me.
COOP400748	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	From what I know	 he's pretty infamous in the
dance scene. You might even find blog posts
from his other victims.
COOP400749	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I think his name was... Atsushi Takayama.
COOP400750	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's the name he'd sign on his bills here.
COOP400751	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You have to promise me you won't do anything
dangerous	 though. Okay?
COOP400760	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There! That's <color=#FF423F>Atsushi Takayama</color>	 right?
COOP400761	AAAAAA==	Wrong	 wrong	 stupid	 wrong! Ohhh	 nothin's
better than teachin' those girls a lesson!

society thanks to me! They oughta be
grateful!

my help.

COOP400782	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 did you already have plans? Come by again
when you're free.
COOP400783	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So... I know this is going to sound too good
to be true	 but that guy came by to
apologize.
COOP400784	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He contacted the owner about it. I was too
scared to be there	 though.
COOP400785	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	From what I heard	 it was like he was a
different person and took full
accountability.
COOP400786	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He said he'd ask for forgiveness from the
others too. Sounds like he's traumatized a
lot of people.
COOP400787	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	He even said he'd turn himself in because
he's sure he must've broken the law from
stalking people.
COOP400788	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	At first	 I thought it was a lie to get me to
drop my guard before he'd start grilling me
again.
COOP400789	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But maybe it's not. I still have my
suspicions	 but at least it's over with.
COOP400790	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Anyway	 enough depressing talk! I hope you'll
help taste-test more drinks for me today.
COOP400791	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hup	 hup! Hah! One	 two	 three...
COOP400793	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Aaand done! Phew...

feedback into my next recipe.
COOP400798	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 there's one thing I needed to ask.
COOP400799	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You did something	 didn't you? About
all this.
COOP400800	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I can tell. The timing's just too perfect.
He was so mad last time	 you know?
COOP400801	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But now he admitted his guilt	 like he was a
different person. And that was all... after
you found out about this.
COOP400802	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Don't look so troubled. It's not like I'm
angry with you.
COOP400803	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	No need to explain yourself. Seems like you'd
prefer to not talk about it anyway.
COOP400804	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But I do want you to tell me one thing.
COOP400805	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	{NAME2}	 you didn't do anything dangerous	
right? I'd feel awful if something ever
happened to you.
COOP400806	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400806]	I didn't.|Just a little.|I'd risk it for you.
COOP400807	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Glad to hear it! But let me know if you got
hurt	 okay?
COOP400808	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Then I can help patch you up	 at least.
COOP400809	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I knew it!
COOP400810	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 I guess you're not badly hurt or
anything if you're here now...
COOP400811	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 come on!

COOP400871	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm gonna enter it.
COOP400872	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Part of the judging involves me making and
submitting an original cocktail...
COOP400873	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So I did some recipe-testing and gave them
a little sip. And may have gotten a little
tipsy...

drive to win this thing	 you know?

what I can do. Just like back when I danced	
I guess...
COOP400880	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I want to show them what I'm capable of now.
I want to prove myself.
COOP400881	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	And it'll give me new goals to aim for!

amazing tricks and try them out too!

COOP400890	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wait	 really!? Yesss! I get to have a
mocktail from {NAME2}-kun!
COOP400892	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Don't mind if I do...
COOP400893	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	*glug glug glug*
COOP400894	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Ah... Wow	 it's sooo tasty! You've gotten
sooo much better	 {NAME2}-kun!
COOP400895	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehehe... Guess I can't sit on my laurels.
I'll have to keep working on my skills too!
COOP400896	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400896]	You're not beating me.|You're doing plenty.|I still have a ways to go.
COOP400897	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh? You're on	 then! No way I'll let myself
lose to you!
COOP400898	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	R-Really!? You think so? You're making me
blush...
COOP400899	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	What	 nuh-uh! You should be saying "way to
go	 me!"
COOP400900	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm proud of you! Keep up the good work!
COOP400901	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe	 this is really tasty	 y'know...?
COOP400904	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hey	 {NAME2}-kun? Could you come sit next
to me?
COOP400905	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's fun talking face-to-face... but right
now	 I want you by my side.
COOP400906	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I mean	 I'm probably all flush right now	 so
it's kinda embarrassing to face you
directly...
COOP400907	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400907]	Yeah	 you're beet red.|I get to see a new side of you.
COOP400908	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	W-Wow...! Y'know	 you shouldn't tease your
elders!
COOP400909	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	B-But... I'll forgive you this once...
COOP400920	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Welcome! Oh	 {NAME2}-kun!
COOP400921	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hey	 do you have a minute? I wanted to tell
you something.
COOP400922	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400922]	I've got time to spare.|I have plans today...
COOP400923	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh... Okay! Talk to you next time.
COOP400924	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So I entered that competition... And the
results are in...
COOP400925	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I didn't win.
COOP400926	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400926]	Oh...|You tried	 though!|Did you have fun?
COOP400927	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Yeah	 I know how much you were rooting for
me. Sorry to let you down.
COOP400928	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Thanks! I might've lost	 but it was still a
worthwhile experience!
COOP400929	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	*gasp*
COOP400930	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Yeah! Of course.
COOP400931	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I gave it my all. I think my cocktail turned
out pretty good too.
COOP400932	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's just that the other bartenders were even
better. So sure	 I might've lost...
COOP400933	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But I got to see so many flair tricks and
cocktails I'd never have thought of.
COOP400934	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	There was so much for me to absorb and learn!
How do I put it...
COOP400935	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I feel like a plant that's just been watered
after a long time!
COOP400936	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400936]	You'll get 'em next time.|Time to blossom!
COOP400937	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400937]	You'll get 'em next time.|Time to blossom!
COOP400938	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Yeah! Watch me! I'm gonna keep growing!
COOP400939	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I have so many tricks and drinks I want to
learn. I'm gonna do my best to take them
all on!
COOP400940	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So... while we're on this topic	 there's a
new drink I wanted you to try	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP400941	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'll get it ready right away.
Just hold on a second.
COOP400942	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hup! Then we do... this!
COOP400943	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	And here you are.
COOP400944	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400944]	What is this?|Looks delicious.
COOP400945	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Just give it a taste. I'm confident in
this one.
COOP400946	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Looks like I don't need to ask. Your face
says it all.
COOP400947	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That was what I performed at the competition.
COOP400948	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I combined all my favorite dance moves to
make my own signature flair.
COOP400949	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's the best flair bartending show I
could do.
COOP400950	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The same goes for that drink. It's my own
signature blend.
COOP400951	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 I didn't put alcohol in it. You don't
have to worry.
COOP400952	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Call it a Yumi Special: Mocktail Edition.
Hehe.
COOP400953	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400953]	I wish I could drink it forever.|I already want more.
COOP400954	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Haha! That's the best compliment a bartender
can get.
COOP400955	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Actually	 I... made that drink with you
in mind.
COOP400956	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I was thinking up new cocktails	 but I kept
thinking of you.
COOP400957	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The drink that best expresses me as I am now
just has to involve you somehow!
COOP400960	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But... Hahaha...
COOP400961	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'm kinda embarrassed now showing it to you!
Still	 I'm glad you enjoyed it!
COOP400962	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I'll make you one with alcohol once you're
old enough.
COOP400963	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So look forward to it getting even more
flavorful	 {NAME2}-kun!
COOP400965	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	By the way... can I ask you something?
COOP400966	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400966]	What is it?|Whatever you need.
COOP400967	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Once you're old enough to drink	 I want to be
the one to make your first.
COOP400968	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hmmm.
COOP400969	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I want that drink to be this mocktail	 but as
a cocktail	 with alcohol in it.
COOP400970	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Is that okay?
COOP400971	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	...!
COOP400972	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Great! I was so worried you'd say no!
COOP400973	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	That's a promise	 okay? You can't take it
back now‚Äînever ever!
COOP400974	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe.
COOP400975	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But I guess it'll still be a while till you
can drink	 huh	 {NAME2}-kun?
COOP400976	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So until then	 you'll be tasting lots and
lots of my mocktails	 okay?
COOP400977	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Here's to the years to come!
COOP400979	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_COOP400979]	Of course it is.|I can't wait.
COOP400980	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Hehe.
COOP400998	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Welcome. Oh	 it's you! Glad to see you again	
{NAME2}-kun.
COOP400999	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Feel free to come by anytime. I'll be
waiting.

COOP400007	AAAAAA==	We should go there
another time...
COOP400024	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shibuya. We spent a while
in an arcade.
COOP400025	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shibuya. We went shopping
in the underground mall.
COOP400026	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shibuya. We gushed over a
band shown on the jumbotron.
COOP400027	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shibuya. We almost got lost
in the crowded crosswalk
COOP400028	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shibuya. We took a stroll
around the city together.
COOP400059	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shinjuku. She took me to a
delicious yakitori restaurant.
COOP400060	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out
in Shinjuku. We got taiyaki in

COOP400063	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out

as she nursed her hangover.
COOP400065	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP400066	AAAAAA==	Sounds like Yumi wants to
make mocktails with me.
I should head over...
COOP400090	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out at the
planetarium. We learned about
some seasonal constellations.
COOP400091	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out at the
planetarium. We brainstormed
more star-themed mocktails.
COOP400092	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out at the
planetarium. The show was
totally different this time.
COOP400093	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out at the
planetarium. We heard someone
snoring in a nearby seat.
COOP400094	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I hung out at the
planetarium. The music playing
there was really pleasant.
COOP400114	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I rode the Ferris
wheel at Odaiba. We gazed at
the buildings in the distance.
COOP400115	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I rode the Ferris
wheel at Odaiba. The view is
so different in this weather.
COOP400116	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I rode the Ferris
wheel at Odaiba. The line took
forever today...
COOP400117	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I rode the Ferris
wheel at Odaiba. It wasn't too
crowded	 so it was relaxing.
COOP400118	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I rode the Ferris
wheel at Odaiba. We talked so
much we forgot about the view.
COOP400148	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I had monjayaki
in Tsukishima. We tried the
mentai cheese mochi monja.
COOP400149	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I had monjayaki
in Tsukishima. We devoured
the pizza-flavored monja.
COOP400150	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I had monjayaki
in Tsukishima. We saw a blue
monja on the menu	 but... no.
COOP400151	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I had monjayaki
in Tsukishima. We switched
it up with some okonomiyaki.
COOP400152	AAAAAA==	Shiina and I had monjayaki
in Tsukishima. We enjoyed
the monja of the day.
COOP400160	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP400161	AAAAAA==	Should I give this to Yaoling?
COOP400167	AAAAAA==	Maybe another time...
COOP400186	AAAAAA==	Yumi and I went back
to my place.
COOP400206	AAAAAA==	Yumi and I made tasty
mocktails at my place. It was
a drink to remember...
COOP400304	AAAAAA==	I got soaked from
head to toe...
COOP400312	AAAAAA==	The woman took me to
where she works.
COOP400327	AAAAAA==	Shiina moves with the grace
of a dancer despite the tight
space behind the bartop!
COOP400345	AAAAAA==	I wonder if Shiina's flair
bartending skills stems
from her Proficiency...
COOP400346	AAAAAA==	Also	 it'd be nice to learn
more about mocktails to
get better at Cooking.
COOP400358	AAAAAA==	Spending time with Shiina	
I feel hope rising
within me...
COOP400430	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400432	AAAAAA==	After telling her my
thoughts on her mocktails	
I left the bar...
COOP400483	AAAAAA==	Shiina's wearing a dazzling
outfit as she dances with zeal
on the screen.
COOP400492	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400501	AAAAAA==	After Shiina taught me
about a new mocktail	
I left the bar...
COOP400551	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400554	AAAAAA==	I dug into Shiina's impromptu
pasta while nursing
the mocktail.
COOP400626	AAAAAA==	Shiina is flair bartending
again. The bar patrons seem
really impressed.
COOP400585	AAAAAA==	Shiina's less talkative
than usual...
COOP400596	AAAAAA==	I try to remember the recipe
Shiina taught me.
COOP400597	AAAAAA==	I made a mocktail for Shiina.
COOP400613	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400625	AAAAAA==	I made Shiina a mocktail	
and she taught me how to
make a new one in return...
COOP400645	AAAAAA==	It mentions some kind of competition for
flair bartenders.
COOP400674	AAAAAA==	He must have bled out every
drop of her desire to dance...
COOP400686	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400688	AAAAAA==	Shiina made me a mocktail.
It felt like it kind of tasted
more bitter than usual.
COOP400735	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400742	AAAAAA==	Shiina's desire is waning...
COOP400752	AAAAAA==	The banned customer's name
is Atsushi Takayama. I should
see if he's in Mementos.
COOP400753	AAAAAA==	After Shiina closed the
store early	 I walked her to
the station.
COOP400769	AAAAAA==	Atsushi Takayama seems to
have had a change of heart.
I should check on Shiina...
COOP400792	AAAAAA==	Shiina's movements seem
even smoother than before...
COOP400796	AAAAAA==	I learned some mocktail tips
from Shiina.
COOP400815	AAAAAA==	I sense a deep sense of trust
between me and Shiina.
COOP400821	AAAAAA==	I should choose my
next words carefully...
COOP400822	AAAAAA==	I'm already in a <color=#FF423F>relationship</color>
with another person...
COOP400830	AAAAAA==	I'm now in a relationship
with Yumi...
COOP400831	AAAAAA==	There's no turning back now...
COOP400836	AAAAAA==	Yumi and I spent time alone
together as she made me
mocktails...
COOP400843	AAAAAA==	Shiina made me a new mocktail.
COOP400850	AAAAAA==	I'm already in a <color=#FF423F>relationship</color>
with another person...
COOP400861	AAAAAA==	Seems like she's drunk...
COOP400865	AAAAAA==	I should get her some water.
COOP400891	AAAAAA==	Seems like she's still
a little drunk...
COOP400902	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shiina
growing deeper...
COOP400903	AAAAAA==	Shiina was still a bit
tipsy	 so I made some
more mocktails for her.
COOP400910	AAAAAA==	I spent time alone with a
drunk Yumi... After walking
her back	 I headed home too.
COOP400958	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Shiina...
COOP400959	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Yumi...
COOP400964	AAAAAA==	I savored the mocktail

COOP40201	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Would you mind if I took a moment of
your time?
COOP40202	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You have my sincerest gratitude. Now then...
COOP40203	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hmm... I ask that you please do visit	 if you
so desire.
COOP40204	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Heheh	 it appears that you would like my
assistance with something.
COOP40205	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Could it have something to do with Naruru!?
COOP40501	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama	 you've arrived.
COOP40502	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	There is a proposal I wish to discuss
with you.
COOP40503	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the inconvenience. Please	
follow me.
COOP40504	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Thank you for coming today.
COOP40505	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please consider this space a reception area.
Master has authorized its use.
COOP40506	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As you know	 it is my role to serve as your
concierge.
COOP40507	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I must support you as you undergo Master's
trial of desire	 as is my duty.
COOP40508	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Therefore	 in order for me to understand you
better...
COOP40509	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...I seek your cooperation in an agreement
of sorts.
COOP40511	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I merely seek your responses to my questions
and requests.
COOP40512	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I must acquire knowledge of you and human
desire in thorough detail.
COOP40514	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You have my gratitude. Now then...
COOP40515	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let us begin with my first inquiry.
COOP40516	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Are you an idol?
COOP40518	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have been studying the complexities of
your world.
COOP40519	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And it is my understanding that idols are
charming	 multifaceted individuals.
COOP40520	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As a possessor of multiple Personas	
I perceive you in a similar nature.
COOP40521	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Excuse the clich√©	 but where do you see
yourself in a few years? Please explain your
desires for the future.
COOP40523	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I presume the two are quite different. Which
is your true desire?
COOP40524	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Then please take the opportunity to do so.
Surely this is a decision you cannot ignore.
COOP40525	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A reasonable degree? Could you describe that
more precisely? I wish for a clear answer.
COOP40527	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hm. In short	 you are still trying to find
yourself.
COOP40528	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In which case	 if I may be so bold	 I will
upgrade our agreement to a special contract.
COOP40529	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like you to bring the Persona I
specify back here to me.
COOP40530	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As I told you before	 a Persona is a part of
one's personality.
COOP40531	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe my image of you may be further
fleshed out by a look at your Persona.
COOP40532	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please bring me <color=#72C5FF>Jack Frost</color>.
COOP40533	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Wait	 my apologies. Such a task must be mere
child's play for you.
COOP40534	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I request a <color=#72C5FF>Jack Frost</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Lucky Punch</color>.
COOP40535	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This will allow me to better understand you
and thus provide you more effective support.
COOP40536	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe this is what humans call a
win-win.
COOP40538	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That shall be all for today. I hope our
special contract proves fruitful.
COOP40539	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In doing so	 I may better support you. Are
you amenable to this agreement?
COOP40701	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought
the Persona I requested.
COOP40702	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I take it you are eager to fulfill our
contract.
COOP40703	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the inconvenience	 but please
come this way.
COOP40704	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	With the Persona you have brought	 I have
come to understand you further.
COOP40705	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Just as I expected...
COOP40707	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Similar to what my master has told you of
this realm	 this very room is a reflection
of yourself.
COOP40708	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Therefore	 bringing a new Persona here will
expand your own potential as well.
COOP40709	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please be aware that the functions of the
Velvet Room have now been upgraded.
COOP40710	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Well then...
COOP40711	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Our contract is proving fruitful.
I understand you more deeply than before.
COOP40712	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 I am not yet satisfied. So I shall
ask you another question.
COOP40713	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Have you ever considered that you yourself
resemble an idol?
COOP40715	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It is my duty to understand you. I shall ask
as many times as necessary.
COOP40716	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Is that so? It is quite evident to me that
you possess such qualities.
COOP40717	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If they allow me to understand you	 I shall
say I do not hate them.
COOP40718	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I hear idols possess several distinct faces.
In short	 they don various "masks."
COOP40719	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If idols indeed possess multiple Personas
like you	 there is much we can learn
from them.
COOP40720	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Therefore	 I would like us to study idols
together.
COOP40722	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I take it we are in agreement.
COOP40723	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am pleased that you are amenable to the
conditions of our contract.
COOP40724	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do aim for this to be a mutually beneficial
arrangement. A win-win	 as you call it.
COOP40726	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now allow me to state my next request.
COOP40727	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I request a <color=#72C5FF>Neko Shogun</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Tarukaja</color>.
COOP40728	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That will be all. I appreciate your continued
cooperation.
COOP40901	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought
the Persona I requested.
COOP40902	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I see you are eager to fulfill our contract.
COOP40903	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the inconvenience	 but please
follow me.
COOP40904	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I feel I now understand you better. As your
concierge	 I am truly grateful.
COOP40905	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Our contract is proceeding smoothly	
but there is something I would like to
confirm with you.
COOP40906	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please watch carefully.
COOP40907	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like you to make these poses.
COOP40909	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I implore you to try. For your sake	 I must
confirm that you can do this.
COOP40910	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do appreciate your directness	 but please
reconsider.
COOP40911	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	With this pose	 a young girl changed
her fate...
COOP40912	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...and rose to stardom as an idol.
COOP40913	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe this pose may be highly beneficial
to you and your efforts to escape ruin.
COOP40914	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This is my hope for you	 as your concierge.
Now please	 begin whenever you are ready.
COOP40916	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Forgive my audacity	 but please adjust the
angle of your feet.
COOP40917	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We cannot reap the full benefits unless your
positioning is perfect.
COOP40918	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As I expected of you	 {PLAYER_NAME}-sama.
You learn quickly.
COOP40919	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	But surely you can aim even higher. Please
copy each of these poses perfectly.
COOP40920	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Come. It is time to unleash your potential.
COOP40922	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You've recreated every pose perfectly.
Without any rehearsal for that matter.
COOP40923	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You have gone far beyond my expectations.
Surely	 you must feel it too.
COOP40924	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yes. There is talent within you!
COOP40926	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Thank you for posing for me. I have no
further poses to request of you at present.
COOP40927	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I assumed it would be too soon for you to
take on my next assignment	 but seeing as
you mastered the posing so skillfully...
COOP40928	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like to continue with the next step
of our contract.
COOP40929	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I request a <color=#72C5FF>Lilim</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Attack Boost I</color>.
COOP40930	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That is all. Thank you for your continued
cooperation.
COOP41101	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought
the Persona I requested.
COOP41102	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You must be eager to fulfill our contract.
COOP41103	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	My apologies for the trouble	 but please
follow me.
COOP41104	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I suggest we take our business on-site to
achieve the most effective results.
COOP41106	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the short notice	 but I ask
that you accompany me.
COOP41107	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As you must already know	 this is Akihabara.
I understand it to be a gathering place
for idols.
COOP41109	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	At present	 this town is a battlefield. Idols
are present everywhere.
COOP41110	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As I said the other day	 all of this is to
further augment your strength.
COOP41111	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Our goal is to observe and grasp what exactly
an idol is.
COOP41112	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Moreover	 I surmise this may further draw out
your Personas' powers.
COOP41113	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 let us make first contact.
COOP41114	Idol on <#000000	t	#FFFFFF>he Clock	We're holding a concert at the local theater
today! Come check us out!
COOP41115	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Pardon me. I have a few questions.
COOP41116	Idol on <#000000	t	#FFFFFF>he Clock	Huh? Oh	 sure. The theater is right past that
corner over‚Äî
COOP41117	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What is your group name? How many members
are there? What is your signature color? What
kinds of merchandise do you offer?
COOP41118	Idol on <#000000	t	#FFFFFF>he Clock	What? Huh? Ummm...
COOP41119	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I hear that idols host photo sessions. Does
your unit do the same?
COOP41120	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	At these events	 how do you interact with
fans? Do you offer anything beyond photos?
COOP41121	Idol on <#000000	t	#FFFFFF>he Clock	T-The details are on this flyer! Have a
nice day!
COOP41122	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	......
COOP41123	O<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>serving Idol	What's with that lady? Is she one of those
wild fans?
COOP41124	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	......
COOP41126	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I see. I assume that by running away	 they
incite their fans to give chase.
COOP41127	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	My assessment was accurate. Idols are indeed
profoundly interesting.
COOP41129	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This requires further analysis. Now	
what next?
COOP41130	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	*gasp* That girl.
COOP41131	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>n Caf√© Employee	We're open! Please visit our caf√©!
COOP41132	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have decided. That girl will be our next
subject.
COOP41133	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>n Caf√© Employee	Have a flyer! We're running a concept caf√©!
COOP41134	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A concept caf√©? Are you not an idol?
COOP41135	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>n Caf√© Employee	Oh	 our caf√©'s theme is idols! I guess that
kind of makes me one.
COOP41136	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Understood. Permit me to ask a few
idol-related questions	 if you will.
COOP41137	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>n Caf√© Employee	Um... Sure	 go ahead.
COOP41138	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What is your name? Are you in a unit? What
is your member color? What should I
call you?
COOP41139	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Do you hold concerts? Photo sessions? What
about autograph sessions and such?
COOP41142	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am always composed. Though perhaps I was a
bit too eager.
COOP41143	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah	 forgive me. Perhaps	 I was a bit
overeager.
COOP41144	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Was there a time limit?
COOP41145	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah	 I can see how it is a breach of
etiquette to hold a long conversation
without compensation.
COOP41146	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>n Caf√© Employee	Hahaha! You're funny.
COOP41147	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>n Caf√© Employee	I'm <color=#FF423F>Narumi Nashimoto</color>	 but you can just call
me "Naruru"!
COOP41148	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Feel free to stop by the caf√© and have
a chat!
COOP41149	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Squee...!
COOP41150	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Squee?
COOP41151	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Such extraordinary talent. You are the ideal
idol that I seek.
COOP41152	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama. Please think of her
as your role model.
COOP41153	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Ah	 it's already this late!?
COOP41154	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Sorry	 I have to go! I hope to see you two at
the caf√©!
COOP41155	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	How unfortunate. I wanted you to observe your
role model for a little longer.
COOP41157	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Why	 of course. Well... perhaps I cannot say
that truthfully.
COOP41158	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What? Why would I desire that?
COOP41159	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That Narumi girl stirs such strong emotions
within me... Just what is this feeling?
COOP41161	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A fan... So this is how it feels.
COOP41162	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The Cat's Claw concept caf√©... If we pay a
visit	 we'll surely meet her again.
COOP41163	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I shall invite you there next time.
COOP41164	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am sure it will be beneficial for you to
learn from her about idols.
COOP41166	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In any case	 let us proceed with the next
phase of our special contract.
COOP41169	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Next	 I request a <color=#72C5FF>Unicorn</color> with
<color=#72C5FF>Healing Boost II</color>.
COOP41170	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let us part ways for today. I appreciate your
continued cooperation.
COOP41301	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought
the Persona I requested.
COOP41302	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You appear eager to fulfill our contract.
COOP41303	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Incidentally	 do you recall our promise?
COOP41305	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I know you have not forgotten. We are meant
to visit the concept caf√©	 or "con caf√©	
if you will.
COOP41306,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,Yes. The con caf√©	 for short. Well
remembered.
COOP41307,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,I do apologize for the short notice, but I
hope that you will accompany me.
COOP41308,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto,Hello! Welcome to The Cat's Claw Caf√©!
COOP41309,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto,Oh, didn't I meet you two the other day?
COOP41310,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,I'm honored that you remember. We have come
to patronize your establishment.
COOP41311,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto,Yay, I'm so happy! Thanks for coming!
COOP41312,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto,Right this way please!
COOP41313,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto,So, what can I get you?
COOP41314,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,I have researched con caf√© etiquette. Allow
me to demonstrate.
COOP41315,Me<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>ope,I request an order of the Gimme Your Love‚ô™
Fave Omelette Rice."
COOP41316	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I hope it will be sufficient to convey my
love for you	 Naruru.
COOP41317	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Great! One order of Fave Omelette Rice!
COOP41319	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As I mentioned	 that was standard con caf√©
etiquette.
COOP41320	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ordering omelette rice from one's "fave" is
the most basic of basic rules of conduct.
COOP41321	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Thanks for waiting! Here is your Fave
Omelette Rice!
COOP41322	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	What's your name	 miss?
COOP41323	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am Merope.
COOP41324	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Got it! So... Who's your favorite	
Merope-chan?
COOP41325	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru!
COOP41326	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	That's right! Everyone's number-one fave	
Narumi Nashimoto	 Naruru‚ô™
COOP41328	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This is an idol's basic introductory call and
response.
COOP41329	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We may be her only audience at present	
but please note that Naruru gives her all no
matter what.
COOP41330	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Behold her brilliant smile	 her pure voice	
her gaze that unshakably meets my own...
COOP41331	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Her performance has an irresistible charm.
COOP41332	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe that there are countless items on
this menu that embody Naruru's charm.
COOP41333	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	For the sake of your personal growth	 we must
sample them all.
COOP41335	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I knew you would understand. Con caf√© idols
are indisputably sophisticated.
COOP41336	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I ask that you have faith in my discerning
eye. It is second to none.
COOP41337	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I cannot deny your claim	 but I believe this
too is a win-win situation.
COOP41338	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	To aid in your development	 we will require
the Head Over Heels Lovey-Dovey Lemonade.
COOP41339	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would also like the Love Stack Pancakes and
the Cutie Cat Strawberry Parfait.
COOP41340	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Wow	 thank you so much!
COOP41341	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Oh! As thanks for ordering so much...
COOP41342	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	That's a ticket for a picture with me at my
next photo session!
COOP41343	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	These are usually just for regulars	 but
you're special.
COOP41344	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Squee!
COOP41345	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Squee?
COOP41346	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I've heard much about the fabled fan photo
ticket. It is finally mine.
COOP41347	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Oops	 I'm sorry! Excuse me one second.
COOP41348	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Hello? Big Sis here.
COOP41349	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	You're hungry? I'm sorry. Look	 there's some
leftover food I got from work in the fridge	
okay?
COOP41350	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah! That was not proper of me.
COOP41351	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I was overcome by emotion. I apologize.
COOP41352	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	At any rate	 I believe Naruru is a truly
superb role model for you.
COOP41353	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In order to best aid your personal growth by
learning the ways of the idol...
COOP41354	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We must attend this photo session.
COOP41356	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In any case	 let us proceed with the next
clause of our special contract.
COOP41358	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Next	 I request a <color=#72C5FF>Byakko</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Bufudyne</color>.
COOP41359	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Thanks for waiting! Here's your lemonade	
pancakes	 and parfait.
COOP41360	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It would seem I have ordered too much. Please
help me finish this food.
COOP41361	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let us part ways for today. I am grateful for
your continued cooperation.
COOP41501	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought
the Persona I requested.
COOP41502	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I take it you are eager to fulfill our
contract.
COOP41503	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Do you recall our earlier promise?
COOP41505	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please do not feign forgetfulness. Naturally	
I am referring to Naruru's photo session.
COOP41506	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. I am glad that you remember.
COOP41507	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the short notice	 but I
request that you accompany me.
COOP41509	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A photo with one's idol is a momentous
occasion. It requires due diligence.
COOP41510	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It is vital that one make an effort to avoid
needlessly burdening their idol.
COOP41511	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	According to my research	 it is helpful to
prepare concise questions that they can
build upon.
COOP41512	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Time is limited after all	 and our discussion
must conclude in a proper fashion.
COOP41514	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. Just as idols have tacit
restrictions	 fans must follow their own
code of conduct as well.
COOP41515	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Of course. Just as idols work to hone
their skills	 fans should put forth an effort
as well.
COOP41516	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You may leave it to me. As Naruru's fan	
I have prepared well in advance.
COOP41517	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It is fascinating how idols and fans share
such a special connection.
COOP41518	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	There is much to learn from them both.
COOP41519	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>aff	Next in line please!
COOP41520	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	At last. Allow me to demonstrate to you a
flawless fan meeting interaction.
COOP41522	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naturally	 I am prepared for all
possibilities.
COOP41524	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	To deepen my understanding of idols	
I have taken the liberty to visit the caf√© in
my own time.
COOP41525	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Come. I ask that you observe my conversation
with Naruru.
COOP41526	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Ah	 Merope-chan! Thanks so much for coming!
COOP41527	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Why	 I would not dare miss it. After all	
you are my one and only	 Naruru.
COOP41528	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Thanks! I'm really glad to see you.
COOP41529	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru	 I read that your favorite food is
pudding. Is that true?
COOP41530	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Yes	 I love pudding!
COOP41531	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I see...
COOP41532	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	......
COOP41533	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Merope-chan? What's wrong?
COOP41534	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah	 it is nothing... Such lovely weather we
are having...
COOP41535	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Haha! Where'd that come from? You're always
so funny	 Merope!
COOP41538	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Hurry it up! Don't just favor the women!
COOP41539	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Her time is way up! Send her packin'!
COOP41541	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Tch... Hurry it up!
COOP41542	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Forgive me. I am aware that to make other
fans wait is a breach of etiquette.
COOP41543	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I'm so sorry. You even saved up all these
tickets.
COOP41544	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do not mind. More importantly	 I'd like a
photo with you	 Naruru.
COOP41545	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Of course! Let's take a cute one!
COOP41546	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	So this is how it feels to take a photo with
your idol. I am remarkably moved.
COOP41548	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	This is why I can't get hyped for you	
Naruru!
COOP41549	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	As a fan	 I expect to see more of a serious
effort from you!
COOP41550	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	R-Right... Um	 sorry.
COOP41551	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	And don't be so mousy either! It's like you
have no passion!
COOP41552	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	You gotta reel fans in! You'll never rise to
stardom just waiting around!
COOP41553	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Yes	 you're absolutely right. I'll try much
harder from now on!
COOP41554	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Exactly. Glad you understand. While we're at
it	 another thing...
COOP41555	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Her ability to tolerate such unreasonable
demands and still keep a smile is
commendable.
COOP41556	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 I can only bear to watch for
so long.
COOP41557	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That is enough	 ruffian.
COOP41558	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Huh? What's your problem! Get lost! It's my
turn now!
COOP41559	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I can no longer ignore your misconduct.
It brings shame to all of us fans.
COOP41560	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You have no right to call yourself a fan of
Naruru. I ask that you leave.
COOP41561	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Merope-chan!
COOP41562	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Screw that! It's you who's gotta go!
COOP41563	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	Now what!? You people need to get your shit
together!
COOP41564	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Fan	No	 YOU do!
COOP41565	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Fan	You're the problem! You're always so mean
to Naruru!
COOP41566	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gular Fan	You go overtime more than anyone else!
COOP41567	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gular Fan	Bully Naruru again and you'll have to deal
with us!
COOP41568	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Fan	What the hell!? Shit!
COOP41569	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Thank you	 everyone. This is how true Naruru
fans should be.
COOP41570	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Fan	You two were awesome!
COOP41571	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Fan	That guy annoyed us	 but we were too afraid
to stand up to him.
COOP41572	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gular Fan	The staff wouldn't do anything about him
since he's a paying customer.
COOP41573	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Everyone... I'm sorry for the trouble	 but
thank you for looking out for me!
COOP41574	F<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ns	NA-RU-RU! NA-RU-RU!
COOP41575	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	And thank you both for coming to my rescue!
COOP41576	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Think nothing of it. As your fan	 I refuse to
tolerate such behavior.
COOP41578	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	All things considered	 our first photo
session has been most rewarding.
COOP41579	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am grateful for your assistance today.
COOP41581	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 let us proceed with the next phase of
our special contract.
COOP41582	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Next	 I request a <color=#72C5FF>Daisoujou</color> with
<color=#72C5FF>Spirit Drain</color>.
COOP41583	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let us part ways for today. I appreciate your
continued cooperation.
COOP41701	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought
the Persona I requested.
COOP41702	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I appreciate your eagerness to fulfill our
contract.
COOP41703	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama	 I would like us to
pay another visit to the land of idols.
COOP41705	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Do not feign ignorance. I refer to Naruru's
place of employment.
COOP41706	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Excellent	 {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. I see you
too have become a fine Naruru fan.
COOP41707	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the short notice	 but I hope
that you will accompany me.
COOP41708	I<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ol on the Clock	Welcome! Ah	 it's Merope-san and her friend!
COOP41709	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Pardon me	 where is Naruru? I believe her
shift is today.
COOP41710	I<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ol on the Clock	I'm sorry. Narumi-chan said she'll be a
bit late.
COOP41711	I<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ol on the Clock	She should be here soon. Would you like to
come back later?
COOP41712	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	No	 that is fine. We will wait inside.
COOP41713	I<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ol on the Clock	Understood! Right this way.
COOP41714	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Hi	 you two! I'm so sorry! My other job ran
too long.
COOP41715	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It was no trouble at all.
COOP41716	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	But I am surprised to hear that you are
working two jobs. You appear to be rather
fatigued.
COOP41717	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Haha. I can't hide anything from you	
Merope-chan.
COOP41718	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am well aware that prying into an idol's
personal life is taboo.
COOP41719	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 I am worried for you	 Naruru.
COOP41720	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Merope-chan...
COOP41721	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If you do not mind	 might I inquire about
your situation?
COOP41722	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Thank you	 Merope-chan. I don't mind
telling you.
COOP41723	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	The truth is	 my family isn't very well-off.
Honestly	 we're flat broke.
COOP41724	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	That's why I need to work to support us all.
COOP41725	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	At first	 I applied to this caf√© because I
heard the pay was good.
COOP41726	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	As I kept at it though	 I started to enjoy
being an idol.
COOP41727	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I love making our guests happy. It isn't just
about the money.
COOP41728	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Everyone's support for me as an idol has
taught me to love myself more.
COOP41729	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru...
COOP41730	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	But my family can't live on this pay alone	
so I have to work multiple jobs.
COOP41732	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	To be honest	 this is hard for me to admit.
COOP41733	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	It doesn't feel right to beg my fans for
sympathy.
COOP41734	Na<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umi Nashimoto	Yeah	 it is. My sister is still young	 so I
have to do my best for her.
COOP41735	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Thank you	 but it's nothing that impressive.
COOP41736	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Still	 I'll take that over pity any day.
COOP41737	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Oh	 don't misunderstand though. I don't want
you to spend more money on me or anything!
COOP41738	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I know idols rely on their fans' financial
support	 but...
COOP41739	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	If you're spending out of pity and not
enjoying yourselves	 then I can't call myself
an idol!
COOP41740	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your dignity in the face of such hardship is
admirable.
COOP41741	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru	 you really are my one true idol.
COOP41742	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Haha. Thank you	 Merope-chan.
COOP41743	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Unfortunately	 I don't think I'll be able to
keep working here much longer.
COOP41744	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	There's this awful event they're planning...
COOP41745	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What kind of event	 Naruru?
COOP41746	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Ah	 Producer!
COOP41747	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Producer	Naruru! One omelette rice for this table	
thank you!
COOP41748	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Uh	 yes	 coming!
COOP41749	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I'm sorry	 we're really busy today.
COOP41750	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I've got to work even harder since I came in
late. I hope you enjoy yourselves!
COOP41751	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Producer	Naruru	 that's too much time at one table.
You gotta multitask better	 'kay?
COOP41752	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Yes	 I'll be more careful.
COOP41753	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	There is a line outside. As fellow fans	 we
must be considerate.
COOP41754	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let us leave for today.
COOP41755	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Those must be Naruru's coworkers.
COOP41756	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	Break's over. Guess we should head back.
COOP41757	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Ugh	 I don't wanna! The pay sucks ass.
COOP41758	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	The producer is such a jerk. He still hasn't
given us our back pay!
COOP41759	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	If it was just us	 I could deal. We barely
try anyway.
COOP41760	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	But Narumi's busting her ass	 and he still
keeps most of her paycheck.
COOP41761	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Excuse me. May I have a moment?
COOP41762	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	Huh? Oh	 you're Narumi-chan's fans!
COOP41763	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Crap	 did you just hear all that?
COOP41764	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please	 tell us more.
COOP41765	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We promise to keep it to ourselves	
of course.
COOP41766	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Like we were saying	 the problem is our
caf√©'s producer.
COOP41767	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	The dude takes pretty much everything
we earn.
COOP41768	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You mean he is not compensating you idols
fairly?
COOP41769	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	Yep. Con caf√©s are way more expensive than
most places	 right?
COOP41770	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	That's because there's a fee for our services
included in the price.
COOP41771	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	That money would normally be included in
our wages.
COOP41772	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	But at our shop the producer takes most of it
for himself.
COOP41774	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Huh? Beats me... We're clueless about all
that complicated stuff.
COOP41775	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	For con caf√©s	 I believe that kind of extra
pay is largely at the discretion of the shop.
COOP41776	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In short	 as long as workers are paid the
minimum wage set by law	 there is no grounds
for legal recourse in most cases.
COOP41777	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	I don't really get it	 but wow! You really
know a lot!
COOP41778	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am well-versed in idol culture and
con caf√©s.
COOP41779	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Anyway	 that's why our management is the
absolute worst.
COOP41780	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Plus	 there's this super messed up event
happening soon.
COOP41781	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Could you elaborate?
COOP41782	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	It's called "Save Your Fave." Basically	 any
idols that don't hit their sales quota will
be fired.
COOP41783	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	Don't tell anyone	 but it's meant to weed out
the girls likely to quit soon...
COOP41784	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	...and Narumi-chan is one of them.
COOP41786	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	Narumi-chan's working another job	 right?
That's why she was late today.
COOP41787	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	And the producer has yelled at her before to
quit the other job to focus on this one.
COOP41788	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	But there's no way she can do that because
no matter how many hours she puts in here	
she still won't make much.
COOP41789	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Narumi's family has it rough. And she has to
work to support her little sister.
COOP41790	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	I think Narumi-chan wants to continue working
as an idol...
COOP41791	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	But she said she'll probably have to quit
this job so she can make enough money for
her family.
COOP41792	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And the producer	 fully aware of this	
intends to force Naruru out at this event?
COOP41793	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Either she succeeds and he profits	 or he
loses someone who planned to quit anyway.
COOP41794	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	On top of that	 the event's gonna bleed the
fans dry. Messed up	 right?
COOP41795	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>thargic Employee	The two of us are safe for now	 but I
wouldn't be surprised if we're next.
COOP41796	F<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ulmouthed Employee	Screw that! If I'm gonna be put on display
like some prize cow	 then I'm quittin' too!
COOP41797	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	......
COOP41799	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please be aware that I am overcome with
blind rage.
COOP41800	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	How dare that vile man exploit a precious
idol like Naruru and try to steal her dreams
away!
COOP41802	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yes. Those are the words I was waiting for.
COOP41803	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If I may offer a suggestion...
COOP41804	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Considering the magnitude of his heinous
deeds	 it is likely that this producer has a
Shadow in Mementos.
COOP41805	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Therefore	 just as you have done up
until now...
COOP41806	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe you can make that corrupt producer
have a change of heart.
COOP41807	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama... I implore you.
Please accept my request.
COOP41808	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I appreciate your kindness in this matter.
COOP41810	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I wish you and the Phantom Thieves the best
of luck.
COOP41813	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	Money	 money	 money	 moneeey! Money	 gimme
that sweet	 sweet moneeeeeey!
COOP41814	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	I'm tellin' ya	 idols are cash cows. Fans
will sign their lives away for a single photo!
COOP41815	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	Heheheh	 fan or idol	 I'll milk 'em all dry!
COOP41817	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	C'moooooon then	 try me! Bring it	 babyyyyy!
COOP41818	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	What's your problem? What'd I do wrong?
COOP41819	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	I just tried to let idols and fans live their
dreams!
COOP41821	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	I wasn't always like this. I used to have
honest ambitions as a producer.
COOP41822	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	But I was incompetent. I couldn't fulfill
anyone's dreams!
COOP41823	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	I was so broken by my own failure... Before
I knew it	 I was resorting to shady business
tactics.
COOP41824	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	Why did it turn out this way?
COOP41826	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	Really? You really think so?
COOP41827	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	Huh... I hope you're right.
COOP41828	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rrupt Producer's Shadow	At least those girls... those budding idols
still have a bright future ahead.
COOP41901	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have fulfilled my
request flawlessly.
COOP41902	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have been occupied with my work as your
concierge and have not visited the con caf√©
as of late.
COOP41903	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am concerned for Naruru.
COOP41904	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do apologize for the short notice	 but I
ask that you accompany me.
COOP41905	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Merope-chan! Welcome	 you two!
COOP41906	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I was hoping you'd come. I have some news!
COOP41907	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Oh	 let me show you to your seats. Right
this way!
COOP41908	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I'm sorry about the other day. I must have
worried you.
COOP41909	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	And... You heard from my coworkers	 right?
That I might lose my job.
COOP41910	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Well	 that's all over now! I can keep working
as an idol!
COOP41911	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	It's like the producer became a different
person overnight. He even pays us
properly now.
COOP41912	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	So I can quit my other job and focus on
this one!
COOP41913	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	How wonderful. An idol's smile is a fan's
greatest treasure.
COOP41914	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am aglow with supreme bliss at this moment.
COOP41916	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Oh	 I guess I must have worried you too.
Sorry about that	 but thank you!
COOP41917	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Oh	 thank you! I thought you only came by for
Merope-chan's sake...
COOP41918	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	But you were cheering for me too! I just
couldn't be happier!
COOP41919	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Also	 they canceled that awful event.
COOP41920	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	And we're holding a fan appreciation event
instead.
COOP41921	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	We're only supposed to invite the regulars	
but here you go!
COOP41922	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This is...!
COOP41923	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	I'd love it if you both came!
COOP41924	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Producer	Naruru! Could you serve that table their
pancakes?
COOP41925	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Yes! Right away!
COOP41926	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Sorry. Duty calls.
COOP41927	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Please come to our event. I'll see you there!
COOP41928	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Producer	Were they happy?
COOP41929	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rumi Nashimoto	Yes! Thank you so much for the tickets.
COOP41930	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Producer	Not at all. Anything for the sake of our
idols and their fans.
COOP41931	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The shop is quite busy today. We will
inconvenience the other fans if we stay for
too long.
COOP41932	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru's smile was all I could ask for. Let
us be off.
COOP41933	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru personally handed me an exclusive
event ticket... I never knew such euphoria
as this.
COOP41935	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Thank you for granting my request. You have
my deepest gratitude.
COOP41936	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe Naruru appreciated your support
as well. I will consider today a victory for
us both.
COOP41937	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 we must thoroughly prepare if we wish to
make the most of this event.
COOP41938	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do hope that I have your cooperation.
COOP41940	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I knew you would say as much.
COOP41941	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah	 this must be what they call "tsundere."
COOP41942	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your love for Naruru is pure and true. As a
fellow fan	 I shall not be outdone.
COOP41943	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Our contract has deepened my understanding of
you tenfold.
COOP41945	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This event will require glow sticks	 happi
coats	 handmade fans	 and...
COOP41946	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please prepare a <color=#72C5FF>Dominion</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Matarukaja</color>	
as well.
COOP41947	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This too is part of our special contract.
COOP41948	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now let us part. I appreciate your
cooperation.
COOP42101	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? {NAME1}-sama. You have brought the
Persona I requested.
COOP42102	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I recognize that you are eager to fulfill our
contract.
COOP42103	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I apologize for the inconvenience	 but I ask
that you follow me.
COOP42104	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Today is the fan appreciation event.
COOP42105	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Naruru will not be the only performer
featured.
COOP42106	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please understand that you must show respect
to the entire cast.
COOP42107	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your support of Naruru is already flawless.
COOP42108	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Therefore	 I shall now demonstrate how to
cheer on the other performers.
COOP42110	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yes. That is the spirit.
COOP42140	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I shall first teach you the basic chants
which can be used for any idol.
COOP42111	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Menma! Hammer! Ginger!
COOP42112	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Amber! Summer! Samba! Salad bar!
COOP42113	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Next	 we shall practice how to properly wave
glow sticks.
COOP42114	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Finally	 we must dress the part.
COOP42115	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	We are prepared. Be advised that I am
overcome with emotion.
COOP42117	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It feels like only yesterday that we began
our special contract.
COOP42118	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I admit I did not expect this change within
myself either.
COOP42119	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	She has acted as a vital turning point in
both of our lives.
COOP42120	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Even after that corrupt producer tried to
exploit her	 Naruru never lost her light.
COOP42121	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This opportunity to meet and help her has
brought me indescribable joy.
COOP42122	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I never imagined that I would develop such an
intense desire to support Naruru.
COOP42123	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now I feel I have come to understand you
and the concept of human desire much more
thoroughly.
COOP42124	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And as your concierge	 I am confident that I
can provide you even greater support going
forward.
COOP42125	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe this experience has been beneficial
for you	 too.
COOP42126	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It was not just I who learned from engaging
in idol culture.
COOP42127	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Idols do not display their emotions freely.
They hide their true feelings behind a
smile... a mask.
COOP42128	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now you have honed the same ability.
COOP42129	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You may utilize each of your Personas to
match your ever-changing environment and
circumstance.
COOP42130	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And of course	 I shall continue to support
you as a fan.
COOP42132	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. I have high hopes for both you
and Naruru.
COOP42133	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have realized in this moment that I am as
much a fan of yours as I am a fan of hers.
COOP42134	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 I will support you and Naruru with all
of my heart and soul.
COOP42136	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Nevertheless...
COOP42137	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like for us to expend all efforts in
supporting Naruru at today's event.
COOP42138	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Let us promise to make this event shine. For
Naruru's sake	 and your own.
COOP49125	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Error: tnxotb-[49125]
COOP49126	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Error: tnxotb-[49126]
COOP49127	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Error: tnxotb-[49127]
COOP49128	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Error: tnxotb-[49128]
COOP49300	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Excellent timing. I wish for us to go
somewhere together to better understand
your true self.
COOP49301	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I must assert that this arrangement is not
part of our contract	 so you are not obliged
to come. What do you say?
COOP49303	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Then	 let us be off.
COOP49305	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Another time	 then.
COOP49306	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I hear the stars evoke feelings of awe within
people.
COOP49307	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What about you? Do you feel it?
COOP49309	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If even you harbor uncertainty	 then such
knowledge must be beyond my comprehension.
COOP49310	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And how does it feel to be in awe? I have
much to learn about human emotions.
COOP49311	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Oh? What manner of desire is it exactly?
Is it excitement toward the stars?
COOP49312	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It appears I am mistaken. The intricacies of
human emotion still remain quite the enigma
to me.
COOP49313	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have noticed a high percentage of our
fellow guests are holding hands.
COOP49314	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What do you think? Shall we follow their
example?
COOP49316	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Idle anticipation is more formidable a foe
than fear. Now then...
COOP49317	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your hand...
COOP49318	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It is a bit dry. I will recommend you a
skincare routine.
COOP49319	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Is that a rule of etiquette? I find the
complexities of social graces are often
veiled in interpretive ambiguity...
COOP49320	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Precisely how much time is required before
we may hold hands? One day? Two?
COOP49330	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Behold	 a movie theater: a recreational
facility that serves as a hub of human
desire.
COOP49331	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I hear movies in particular are a form of
entertainment that requires much time and
effort.
COOP49332	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	For what reason do people make and
watch them?
COOP49334	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yes	 they are a form of expression. An
integration of various art forms born of
human desire...
COOP49335	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Gazing at a dazzling screen in a dim room is
much like a ritual.
COOP49336	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I see. In short	 it is to escape reality?
COOP49337	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	To go to such lengths... Escapism is a
powerful human desire.
COOP49338	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Man found gods within the earth	 the
mountains	 and the sky...
COOP49339	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	And spun tales of these entities	 passing
them down through generations...
COOP49340	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Movies share in that very same tradition.
COOP49341	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	They are the mythos of the modern day.
COOP49343	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Humans have not correlated the two? Perhaps
it is an unconscious behavior.
COOP49344	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As always	 your quick acumen is a boon.
COOP49345	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	At any rate	 I must assess these "movies"
with my own eyes.
COOP49346	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Incidentally	 I have learned that "popcorn"
is an essential part of the experience.
COOP49360	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	This is Kokatsu Academy. I believe you attend
this institution.
COOP49361	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A bittersweet melting pot of desires	
regrets	 triumphs	 and failures rest within
its walls...
COOP49362	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What desires do you embrace as you engage in
your academic journey?
COOP49364	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Youth... You speak of the golden era bestowed
exclusively upon the adolescent?
COOP49365	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A desire that is truly sublime. I urge you to
proceed with your endeavors.
COOP49366	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That appears to be the general consensus
among today's generation. However	 you are no
ordinary teenager.
COOP49367	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As your concierge	 I would like you to be
more avaricious.
COOP49368	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Studies	 sports	 friends	 romance... There is
much desire to be found.
COOP49369	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I acknowledge your dedication to your...
extra-curricular commitments	 but take care
not to neglect your school life.
COOP49370	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If anything	 the true source of your power
lies in your own desires.
COOP49372	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You will understand one day. For now	 keep
my words at heart.
COOP49373	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would expect no less from you. I am honored
to be your concierge.
COOP49374	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 I desire a tour of the school. I wish to
immerse myself in this "feeling of youth" for
myself.
COOP49400	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Jinbocho is known as the world's largest
marketplace for secondhand books.
COOP49401	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have perused through various books in my
attempt to study human nature.
COOP49402	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What about you? Have you an affinity for
reading?
COOP49404	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That is sufficient. Manga is a very popular
form of amusement in the modern day.
COOP49405	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It is a clear reflection of your desires.
I am much intrigued.
COOP49406	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	How wonderful. Reading is the embodiment of
intellectual desire.
COOP49407	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am quite curious as to what you have read.
COOP49408	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Incidentally	 my most recent literary
pursuits have been centered around idols.
COOP49409	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Idol magazines in particular have contributed
greatly to the concept of Phantom Idols.
COOP49411	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. Next to the Velvet Room	 this
marketplace is like a second home to me.
COOP49412	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. I have already forged strong
connections with several shop owners.
COOP49413	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Leave everything to me. I shall take it upon
myself to escort you through the mesmerizing
landscape of literature.
COOP49430	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	A Ferris wheel moves slowly to allow one to
enjoy the view at different heights...
COOP49431	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	...Or so everyone believes.
COOP49432	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In truth	 it is a throne where desires and
love clash	 and relationships are formed.
COOP49433	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Or so claims a certain book. Yet	 now that we
are inside	 it appears to be devoid of such
characteristics.
COOP49434	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What do you think? Does your heart brim with
desire?
COOP49436	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That is wonderful. Please lay bare those
desires.
COOP49437	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Do you mean to say I do not stimulate your
desires?
COOP49438	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Who will	 then? Let us bring them along
next time.
COOP49440	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hmm. The desire between lovers is truly
inexplicable.
COOP49441	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	As a concept well beyond my grasp	 it is
obvious I still have much to learn.
COOP49442	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	In the meantime	 please continue to
accompany me.
COOP49992	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Is this...!? What an exceptional masterpiece‚Äî
it checks all of my boxes.
COOP49993	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Words cannot do justice to how thankful I am.
I will cherish this wonderful day forever.
COOP49994	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am correct in that you wish to give this
to me...?
COOP49995	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I appreciate your kindness. I graciously
accept this gift.
COOP49997	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Where would you like to go first?
COOP49998	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like you to choose where we will be
going.
COOP49999	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	An excellent choice	 I must say.
COOP50000	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Going here would not serve you well at this
time	 I must say.
COOP49449	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I feel that contemplating the vastness of
the starry sky like this has been a very
meaningful use of time.
COOP49450	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I find the plot of this movie vexing. Perhaps
because mortal desires are mysterious and
unfathomable to me...
COOP49451	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The school... Though it is far removed from
me	 I hear it is an unforgettable and
emotional place for everyone.
COOP49452	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now then	 what kind of books shall we
encounter today? I must say	 I am quite
excited.
COOP49453	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Facing you like this	 letting everything else
fade away... It is quite envigorating.
COOP49500	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I have been waiting for you. I would like to
part from our usual routine for today	 if you
will...
COOP49501	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would like to accompany you to your abode	
so that I may understand you more deeply.
COOP49502	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Would this be inconvenient for you?
COOP49504	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Then	 let us be off.
COOP49506	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	If it is as you say	 then so be it. Perhaps
another time then.
COOP49550	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	So these are your personal quarters... I see	
how intriguing.
COOP49551	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	How do you usually occupy your time while you
are here?
COOP49553	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	An important activity. I have heard that
sleep is vital for humans to reach their full
potential.
COOP49554	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Please	 do not hesitate to sleep if you so
desire. After all	 I am the one imposingly
observing your room.
COOP49555	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Are you embarrased? I suppose this is your
personal space.
COOP49556	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I understand there must be... some matters
here you wish to keep to yourself. Allow me
to test my own intuiton.
COOP49557	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Hmm... This space seems to have a very
different feel from the Velvet Room.
COOP49558	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	The Velvet Room is a place between dreams and
reality	 mind and matter...
COOP49559	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	It also reflects the "mental state" of those
who visit it.
COOP49560	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Though this is now the material plane	 these
are your private quarters. I presumed the two
would share a common thread.
COOP49562	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I see. Reflecting one's mental state and
attaining mental calm are not one and
the same.
COOP49563	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I see. I understand that were my master here	
it would certainly be difficult to relax.
COOP49564	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 pay me no mind. I would like you to
think of me as invisible if you so need.
COOP49566	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Your private quarters are quite... curious.
I feel as though I could discover something
new with each visit.
COOP49600	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama	 you've arrived.
COOP49601	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I must say	 I'm incredibly grateful for how
you accompanied me to the con caf√© earlier.
COOP49602	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Because you were there	 I was able to enjoy
myself without hesitation. I am glad it is
something we were able to do together.
COOP49603	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 I realize that I may have been the
only one having fun.
COOP49604	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	For that reason	 I hope you'll allow me to
entertain you today.
COOP49606	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. If I may be so bold	 I would like to
act as your personal employee.
COOP49607	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	No need for shyness. If I may be so bold	
allow me to act as your personal employee.
COOP49608	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do apologize for the short notice	 but I
ask that you accompany me.
COOP49609	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 if you'll excuse me...
COOP49610	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	So... what can I get for you?
COOP49612	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	My emulation here is so that you may
experience what I felt.
COOP49613	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 it seems I must study further on
how to express emotion. At any rate	 I hope
you will bear with me for this time.
COOP49614	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Today's special is the "Gimme Your Love‚ô™ Fave
Omelette Rice."
COOP49616	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Great	 one order of Fave Omelette Rice.
COOP49618	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Thanks for waiting. Here is your Fave
Omelette Rice...
COOP49619	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Got it. So... Who is your favorite?
COOP49621	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	That's right. It's me	 Merope	 also known as
your concierge.
COOP49622	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	You mustn't feel embarrassed. Once you cast
away the momentary shame	 you will feel only
bliss.
COOP49623	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	At any rate	 it can be quite difficult in the
moment. Let us conclude there for today.
COOP49624	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What do you think? I hope you enjoyed that.
COOP49626	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I hope we'll be able to continue socializing
in this way going forward.
COOP49627	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I believe it will lead to mental growth	
which will in turn strengthen your Personas.
COOP49630	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	{PLAYER_NAME}-sama	 you've arrived.
COOP49631	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I must say	 I'm incredibly grateful for how
you accompanied me to the photoshoot earlier.
COOP49632	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Because you were there	 I was able to enjoy
myself without hesitation. I am glad it is
something we were able to do together.
COOP49633	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	However	 I realize that I may have been the
only one having fun.
COOP49634	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	For that reason	 I hope you'll allow me to
invite you to a photoshoot today.
COOP49636	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Indeed. If I may be so bold	 I would like to
act as your personal fave.
COOP49637	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	No need for shyness. If I may be so bold	
I would like to act as your personal fave.
COOP49638	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I do apologize for the short notice	 but I
ask that you accompany me.
COOP49639	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now	 if you'll excuse me...
COOP49640	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Ah	 {NAME1}-chan. Thank you so much for
coming.
COOP49642	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I am recreating the event we had with my fave
so that you may experience what I felt.
COOP49643	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Now then	 let us take a fan photo together.
COOP49644	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Are you ready? Okay. And pose.
COOP49646	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Come now	 {NAME1}-chan. It's lonely being
the only one to pose for a photograph.
COOP49647	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Okay	 here we go. Great pose	 by the way	
{NAME1}-chan.
COOP49648	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	Yay. Look at us	 {NAME1}-chan and Merope.
Two peas in a pod.
COOP49649	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	What do you think? I hope I was able to
convey the fun of a photoshoot to you
as well.
COOP49651	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I had intended for you to enjoy this	 but I
must admit that it was enjoyable for me
as well.
COOP49652	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I would not be opposed to actually taking a
selfie with you someday.
COOP50001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 {NAME2}! You have a sec?
COOP50002	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's something I wanna ask you.
COOP50004	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks!
COOP50005	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But not here... Let's go somewhere else! We
can grab a bite and chat at the diner!
COOP50006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP50007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No worries! Maybe some other time.
COOP50008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 that thing I wanted to ask... It's about
the Phantom Thieves.
COOP50009	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You need to be strong to fight in the
Metaverse	 right?
COOP50010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've kept up some light strength training
since quitting baseball	 but it's not enough.
COOP50011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So please	 will you train with me!?
COOP50013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The truth is	 I have ZERO motivation when I'm
alone...
COOP50014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've always trained with Tomoko since
little league. I really can't improve without a
buddy.
COOP50016	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And if I'm with you	 I don't have to explain
why I wanna get strong!
COOP50017	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Plus	 it's not a bad deal for you	 {NAME2}	
right?
COOP50018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Please	 be my coach!
COOP50020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks! I'm counting on you	 {NAME2}.
COOP50021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmmm... I wonder what sort of training a
Phantom Thief should do?
COOP50022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No doubt running and push-ups and stuff	
right? Upper body-strength seems essential	
too...
COOP50024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's see... Running	 strength training. Also
pitching and batting practice	 of course!
COOP50025	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There are batting cages in Yongen-Jaya I used
to go to all the time with Tomoko.
COOP50026	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We wanted to hit a home run really bad	 so we
practiced our hearts out there.
COOP50028	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha	 I guess so. I really threw myself into
every swing.
COOP50029	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I haven't gone since I quit baseball	 but
it'll always be a special place to me.
COOP50030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I did. Once	 maybe? I don't really remember.
COOP50031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Talking about this kinda makes me wanna go
back there. Should we go after this?
COOP50032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Great!
COOP50033	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wow	 it's been forever since I've come here.
Still exactly the same.
COOP50034	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
COOP50036	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um... I'm good today.
COOP50037	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm still in my school uniform and all!
I can't swing in this outfit.
COOP50038	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Besides	 I don't need to improve my batting
skills like I did before.
COOP50039	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But we did come all the way out here. If you
wanna hit	 go for it	 {NAME2}!
COOP50040	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah! I can also give you all my tips and
tricks for swinging the bat.
COOP50041	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So how about it? I'll give you pointers from
behind! This place also has prizes	 so it
should be fun!
COOP50043	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right! Done deal!
COOP50044	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In return	 you're gonna help me work out.
COOP50047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 let's head over to the cage.
COOP50048	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Step out forward a bit further!
COOP50049	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 just like that	 perfect!
COOP50200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's up? Wanna train together?
COOP50201	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP50203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay! Let's meet up after getting changed!
COOP50204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP50205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No worries! We can work out together when
you're free!
COOP50206	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So I've been thinking... I feel like we
should start from the basics.
COOP50207	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That means wind sprints!
COOP50208	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just kidding! Let's start with walking. We've
gotta ease our bodies into exercising.
COOP50210	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 let's get started!
COOP50211	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew	 I'm exhausted!
COOP50212	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 since getting out of school	 we've been
at this for... two and a half hours? Really?
It's way earlier than I expected...
COOP50213	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...but my knees are already shaking.
COOP50214	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Walking seems so easy. I had no idea I was
this outta shape...
COOP50215	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm glad we didn't start with sprints.
COOP50216	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll just have to keep this up	 till I regain
my strength	 and get strong like I used to‚Äî
COOP50217	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
COOP50219	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Oh	 sorry. I was just... remembering
stuff.
COOP50220	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Back in the day I used to practice batting at
full strength after running.
COOP50221	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But now... there's no way I could do that.
And not because I'm physically weaker.
COOP50222	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know what I said to Kiuchi. But the truth
is... I still feel something holding me back.
COOP50223	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's why I avoided playing at the batting
cages.
COOP50224	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know there isn't any real reason why I
shouldn't play baseball anymore.
COOP50225	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've found the strength to go back to it...
to go after what I love again. But... I think
I'm scared to.
COOP50226	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I keep thinking... what if something bad
happens again?
COOP50228	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks... I feel a bit better hearing you
say that.
COOP50229	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Coming from you	 {NAME2}	 it really does
feel like things will be okay.
COOP50230	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah... You're right.
COOP50231	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I can't keep running away.
COOP50232	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's it. I'm gonna go to the batting cages
right now!
COOP50233	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Plus	 you're with me.
COOP50234	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I feel like if I go now	 I can do it.
COOP50235	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even though I'm exhausted	 I'm gonna face
this head on!
COOP50236	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 here I go!
COOP50237	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
COOP50238	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The pitch wasn't even that fast...
COOP50239	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ugh... Next! Next!
COOP50240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm useless. I can't hit anything!
COOP50241	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Easy pitches	 ground balls	 nothing! My arm's
really sore too.
COOP50242	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry to drag you all the way out here to
watch me not hit a single frickin' ball.
COOP50243	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I gave you all those pointers only to whiff
myself. I'm so pathetic. Ahaha...
COOP50244	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Obviously it sucks now	 but I'll be damned if
I don't try again. Anyway	 thanks for today!
COOP50245	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks to you	 {NAME2}	 I feel like I can
start moving forward again.
COOP50247	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Later!
COOP50400	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	'Sup!? Feel like training with me?
COOP50401	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP50403	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cool cool! Let's get changed and get to work!
COOP50404	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP50405	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No biggie! Hit me up when you're free!
COOP50406	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh. So this is what it looks like inside.
COOP50408	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I thought we could work out at the gym today.
COOP50409	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I found a coupon for this place while I was
looking into strength training!
COOP50410	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've never focused on bulking up before.
First	 I wanna try out all the equipment!
COOP50411	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 um... You hold this part and‚Äî Whoa	
it moved!
COOP50412	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is... harder... than I thought!
{NAME2}... How you doing?
COOP50413	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah! Hooo! Raaagh!
COOP50414	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Now let's try the dumbells!
COOP50415	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 lots of different options. What size
will you rep with	 {NAME2}?
COOP50417	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You gotta try harder than that! Why do they
even have weights that light!?
COOP50418	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nice	 sounds perfect! It says here that's a
great weight for beginners.
COOP50419	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	200 pounds? Go for it	 champ.
COOP50420	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll try... those! It's my first time	
so I'll go with the 5 pounders.
COOP50421	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*pant* *huff* Ngh...!
COOP50422	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is this how slow reps... are supposed to
feel? 'Cause I think they're working...
COOP50423	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	My arms... feel so... heavy! You?
COOP50425	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Dang	 you're strong! I can't go fallin'
behind!
COOP50426	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know	 right? We shouldn't overdo it. Let's
take a break.
COOP50427	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew! Ahaha	 I'm wiped.
COOP50428	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But no pain no gain	 right!? Fatigue now	
muscles later.
COOP50429	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll be ripped before you know it...
COOP50430	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahahaha	 lookin' good	 Mr. Muscles!
COOP50431	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh by the way	 I actually went back to the
batting cages again on my own.
COOP50432	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You really encouraged me	 {NAME2}.
COOP50433	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So I felt like I had to give it another shot.
COOP50434	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I still sucked	 but I played in a much better
mood than before.
COOP50435	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So thanks for that	 {NAME2}!
COOP50437	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You've been a big help with this Kiuchi thing
too. I really owe you a lot	 {NAME2}.
COOP50438	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let me know if I can ever return the favor!
COOP50440	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And I'm counting on you too	 Leader!
COOP50441	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yup	 leave it to me!
COOP50442	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thought you'd never ask!
COOP50443	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	See you later!
COOP50445	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	JK	 like that's possible!
COOP50600	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's the haps? Wanna work out?
COOP50601	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP50603	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okie!
COOP50604	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP50605	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's cool! Holler at me when you've
got time!
COOP50606	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 let's go! Get ready for some
walkin'!
COOP50608	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nah	 we're goin' somewhere else today.
COOP50609	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nope! Thought we'd go somewhere a bit
different for today's training.
COOP50610	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mmm	 pork buns and fried rice...
COOP50611	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 there's no way we can walk there!
COOP50612	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyway	 just follow me. We don't have to
change today.
COOP50613	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think the training's working. We've walked
for forty minutes and I'm not out of breath!
COOP50615	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm making today my cheat day.
COOP50616	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ever since I decided to get into shape	 I've
been watching my diet.
COOP50617	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I still gotta treat myself from time to time	
but I might lose control if I'm alone.
COOP50619	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! Just like that! Oh	 and you can order
whatever you want	 {NAME2}.
COOP50620	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're here doing me a solid	 so this one's
on me!
COOP50621	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Time to dig in!
COOP50622	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mmm! So good!
COOP50623	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yup	 I'd definitely die without parfaits!
Ahhh	 chocolate that melts in your mouth
is the best!
COOP50624	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahhh	 I'm so full and happy...
COOP50625	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Rewarding myself from time to time helps me
stay motivated for training.
COOP50626	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	My little league coach taught me that.
COOP50627	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He said it's bad to work too hard	 and that
depriving yourself is actually worse for
your body.
COOP50628	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	By eating what I like today... I can give it
my all tomorrow!
COOP50630	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yup! I'm a car	 and parfaits are my gas!
COOP50631	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I... No way! I'm gonna walk after this and
burn it all off.
COOP50632	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hehe	 thanks! I couldn't do it without you	
Coach.
COOP50634	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know	 there was this one girl in little
league who really watched what she ate.
COOP50635	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even though we were kids	 her lunch was only
red meat. Plus she counted her calories.
COOP50636	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I never put in that kinda effort. I also ate
a ton of fried chicken. Ahaha...
COOP50637	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What was her name again? I think she's the
same age as us...
COOP50638	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks for today	 Coach! All right	 time to
walk all the way home!
COOP50639	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Also	 I'm waaay too full	 so the batting
cages are a no-go today.
COOP50640	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	Is that... Motoha Arai?
COOP50641	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	She did mention the batting cages... Probably
the ones in Yongen-Jaya...
COOP50642	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Walking after a big meal is great! I can feel
the calories burning!
COOP50800	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yo! Ready for a workout?
COOP50801	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP50803	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sounds good! Let's hit the locker rooms	 then
meet back up!
COOP50804	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP50805	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 okay! Another time then!
COOP50806	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm used to walking now. Soon I should be
good to try running.
COOP50807	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	With all of our strength training	 my muscles
are lookin' pretty in shape now...
COOP50808	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So today I wanna see how hard these arms can
swing.
COOP50810	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks	 I will! Cheer me on	 okay	 {NAME2}?
COOP50811	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	'Course not! If you're gonna underestimate me	
just remember who's holdin' the bat	 bud.
COOP50812	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha... I wonder if I can. Welp	 I'll give
it shot!
COOP50813	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hiyah!
COOP50814	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah!
COOP50815	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right... there!
COOP50817	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahhh...!
COOP50820	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	One more time! Huh?
COOP50821	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess that was the last ball. Hmmm...
I wonder what my batting stats are.
COOP50822	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	More importantly	 I'm swinging better than
before. And my arm isn't getting sore anymore
either.
COOP50823	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The first time we came	 my arms hurt so bad
they were shaking...
COOP50824	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But now the training is finally starting to
pay off.
COOP50825	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 I'm feelin' pretty good about
this. Time to give it another go!
COOP50826	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	......
COOP50827	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 that girl...
COOP50828	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	Hiyah!
COOP50829	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! She's on the home run board... and
batting at expert level!
COOP50830	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She's so awesome! I wanna train so I can bat
like her.
COOP50831	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh... Hey! That was really awesome! You hit
so many home runs!
COOP50832	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	Obviously. I've worked hard to get this far.
COOP50833	Girl wit<#000000	h	#FFFFFF> Ponytail	To keep up with you... Motoha Arai.
COOP50834	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 how do you know my name?
COOP50835	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	You were my one and only rival... I could
never forget your name.
COOP50836	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	But it seems my mediocrity never left an
impression on you...
COOP50837	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um	 that's... Sorry...
COOP50838	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Ponytail	I'm <color=#FF423F>Tamayo Yoshida</color>. I'm on the high school
baseball team.
COOP50839	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tamayo... Yoshida... Tamayo... Tamayo... Ah!
COOP50841	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 she's the kid I was talking about. The
one with the strict diet!
COOP50842	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You are	 right?
COOP50843	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Yeah. Hmph	 nice of you to remember.
COOP50844	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right... So you're still playing baseball.
COOP50845	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Yup. Even after you quit.
COOP50846	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I was surprised to see my rival disappear
from the mound so suddenly.
COOP50847	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
COOP50848	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	But!
COOP50849	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	You getting back into baseball is better than
anything I could've wished for!
COOP50850	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Motoha Arai	 I need your help.
COOP50851	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	My help...?
COOP50852	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I practice every day in the hopes of one day
reviving women's pro baseball.
COOP50853	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	There's only so much I can do on my own. But
with you back in the game	 I'm sure we could
do it!
COOP50854	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm happy that you thought of me.
COOP50855	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Right on!
COOP50856	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I can't help you the way I am now.
COOP50857	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Didn't you watch me swing earlier? Unlike
you	 I could barely get a run‚Äîlet alone a
home run.
COOP50858	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	You've been away from the sport	 but there's
no way you've lost your unmatched sense
for it.
COOP50859	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If you work at it	 I'm sure you'll be a
first-string player in no time!
COOP50860	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Pitching	 batting	 an all-rounder... That's
who you were in little league!
COOP50861	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sure I was "Mean Mitts Motoha" back in the
day	 but that's ancient history.
COOP50862	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Plus...
COOP50863	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I see...
COOP50864	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Hey	 asshat!
COOP50865	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	You were with her at the diner too. Who the
hell are you?
COOP50867	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. I'll slack off if I train alone	
so he's here to supervise me.
COOP50868	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 a good friend who watches my back in
battl‚Äî Batting practice	 and stuff...
COOP50869	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is no time for jokes!
COOP50870	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	He's a friend! Just a friend	 okay!?
COOP50871	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 what I'm trying to say is... He's my
coach!
COOP50872	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Coach	 huh...?
COOP50873	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Doesn't look like much of a coach.
COOP50874	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha‚Äî!? Sure he is!
COOP50876	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No! We're not gonna take that!
COOP50877	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Take that back!
COOP50878	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I just stated a fact.
COOP50879	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If you train with that coach	 you won't get
back to your former glory.
COOP50880	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Join my team. You'll be trained by first-rate
coaches.
COOP50881	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I said I can't help you right now! Besides	
if you're gonna talk to my friend like
that...
COOP50882	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	That how you wanna play it?
COOP50883	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Fine. Then how 'bout this? Let's decide by
who can hit the most home runs.
COOP50884	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If you win	 I'll take back what I said. But
if you lose	 you're gonna help me bring back
the women's pro league.
COOP50885	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Fine! Let's do it!
COOP50886	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	It's settled then. We'll each hit three balls
from that machine. Whoever gets more
homers wins.
COOP50887	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	But it'd be too easy for me to crush you now.
Let me know when you think you're ready to
take me on!
COOP50888	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I'll be waiting for the day you join my team	
Motoha Arai!
COOP50889	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Wahahahaha!
COOP50890	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll knock you out of the park first!
COOP50891	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh god! Why did I say that!?
COOP50892	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I just got so worked up! What do I do!? Can I
really beat her!?
COOP50894	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! If you say so	 {NAME2}	 I actually
feel like I can!
COOP50895	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right! First I need to get to the point where
I can hit a home run!
COOP50896	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah! There's no way I can lose! Wait	
all-rounder? Am I pitching and batting!?
COOP50897	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyway! I'm not ready to win yet	 so I've
gotta train!
COOP50898	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We'll show her what a good coach you are.
So to do that...
COOP50899	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Please keep helping me train!
COOP50901	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	With you at my side	 I'm unstoppable!
COOP50902	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks for helpin' me out	 Coach!
COOP51000	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's goin' on? Wanna head to the batting
cages with me?
COOP51001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP51003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks...
COOP51004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP51005	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Got it! Gimme a shout next time you're free!
COOP51006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 um... Sorry about last time. I was being
selfish.
COOP51008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've only been thinking of winning lately...
COOP51009	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This training was supposed to make me
stronger as a Phantom Thief	 not for me to
take on Tamayo.
COOP51010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But when she badmouthed you... I just got so
pissed.
COOP51011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So I'm	 you know	 sorry I got you involved
and stuff.
COOP51013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Awesome! Thank you	 {NAME2}.
COOP51014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 let's get in some special training
at the batting cages. I won't lose to Tamayo!
COOP51017	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Take that!
COOP51018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll make you eat those words! No way I'm
losing to you!
COOP51019	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Raaagh!
COOP51020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right!
COOP51021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just one more... pitch!
COOP51022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm making contact with the ball more than
before. Home runs will happen at some point.
COOP51023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	When I was in little league	 nonstop
swinging practice like this was how I
improved.
COOP51024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If I keep this up	 I'll be knocking 'em out
in no time!
COOP51026	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sure	 I stopped playing for a bit	 but I was
able to hit Kiuchi's pitch at his Palace.
COOP51027	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A pitching machine is nothing by comparison!
Don't you think	 {NAME2}?
COOP51029	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know	 right? Okay	 back to batting
practice!
COOP51030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oof... So	 you're not sure I can win? Don't
worry! Watch me bring the fury!
COOP51031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Next one will be a home run! Just you watch!
Maybe not though	 haha.
COOP51032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 one more time!
COOP51033	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't be afraid to give me pointers	 Coach!
COOP51034	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ngh!
COOP51035	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	My hands are used to swinging again! Now
we're talkin'!
COOP51036	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haaaaa!
COOP51037	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I need to send the ball higher. Maybe if I
angle the bat like this...
COOP51038	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nope!
COOP51041	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew!
COOP51042	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*pant* *pant*...
COOP51043	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm starving. Let's stop here for today.
COOP51044	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks for hangin' with me	 {NAME2}!
COOP51046	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha... Now my stomach's grumbling. What
should I eat on the way home?
COOP51047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll hit that home run next time! You'll see!
COOP51200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 how's it goin'? Feel like hitting the
batting cages?
COOP51201	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP51203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Cool! Let's change and head over!
COOP51204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP51205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 okay. Lemme know when you're around!
COOP51206	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haaah!
COOP51209	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Motoha Arai...
COOP51211	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Oh	 it's you... The "coach." {PLAYER_NAME}...
right?
COOP51213	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I...
COOP51214	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	No	 this isn't a conversation for here.
If you wanna talk	 follow me.
COOP51215	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I think I said this before	 but Motoha was
my idol.
COOP51216	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I have two older brothers. Both into baseball
from a young age.
COOP51217	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I've always liked my brothers and respected
them. I even cheered them on at nationals.
COOP51218	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	So	 when I started thinking I wanted to play
baseball too	 my brother told me of the
legend that was Motoha Arai.
COOP51219	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	He said he'd played against a girl my age and
lost miserably. That girl was Motoha Arai.
COOP51221	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I was shocked. After that I joined
my brother's team and waited for a match
against her.
COOP51222	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	The first time we faced off was the day I
learned what a true prodigy looks like!
COOP51223	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I wanted to be like that. If I were as strong
as her	 I could keep playing baseball in the
future like my brothers.
COOP51224	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I know it's harder for women to go pro	 so I
strived to get stronger.
COOP51225	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	But...
COOP51226	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I was devastated when Motoha Arai disappeared
from baseball.
COOP51227	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	It wasn't always about the competition.
I wanted to be on the same pro team with her
some day.
COOP51229	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Obviously	 my love for baseball didn't fizzle
when she jumped ship.
COOP51230	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Instead	 I put enough effort into it for the
both of us!
COOP51231	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	After little league	 I joined the school team
and decided I wanted to become a pro women's
baseball player no matter what!
COOP51232	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I even talk tougher now. I needed to have
thick skin to be taken seriously in the
male-dominated sports world.
COOP51233	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	But I also realized... I can't bring back the
women's pro league on my own.
COOP51234	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Knowing that	 I still train day in and day
out. But now...!
COOP51235	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If Motoha Arai comes back to baseball	 then
there's still hope!
COOP51236	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	One strong player can change the world!
COOP51237	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Besides	 she's here because she loves
baseball	 right?
COOP51238	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Then this should all make sense to her. That
girl will always have a place on the field!
COOP51242	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Fine. I know I didn't ask her feelings
outright	 but there's no way her love for
baseball has changed!
COOP51243	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	No one loved baseball more than she did
back then.
COOP51245	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Let me ask you one thing. Why did you become
Motoha Arai's coach?
COOP51247	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Huh. I'm curious how much of a help you
actually end up being.
COOP51248	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	You sound like you couldn't care less. No way
I'm leaving Motoha Arai's coaching to a jerk
like you.
COOP51249	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Friends? Huh. So you're not teammates. Hmm...
COOP51250	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I know what you're gonna say	 so spare me.
I'm not backing down.
COOP51251	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Our match is just around the corner!
COOP51252	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If you wanna prove you're right	 then all
she has to do is hit some home runs.
COOP51253	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I'll be waiting to hear from her when she's
ready! Until then	 "Coach."
COOP51254	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Ahahahaha!
COOP51257	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Another day of whiffs. Ow... My arm hurts...
COOP51258	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 {NAME2}? Where were you?
COOP51262	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yay	 juice! Thanks	 I'm gonna drink this	
then practice some more.
COOP51264	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whew! I feel refreshed! All right	 let's go
one more time!
COOP51265	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks for today! Look forward to my home
runs	 buddy!
COOP51400	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm going to the batting cages today.
COOP51401	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Could you look at my form for me?
COOP51402	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Today I'm definitely gonna hit a home run!
COOP51403	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
COOP51405	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okey-doke! I'll head over there first!
COOP51406	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP51407	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't sweat it! Just let me know when you
have time!
COOP51408	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*huff* *huff*...!
COOP51409	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ngh!
COOP51410	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why...?
COOP51411	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Why can't I hit anything!?
COOP51413	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 {NAME2}...
COOP51414	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm sorry. I know I invited you here	 but I'm
such a wreck...
COOP51416	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But‚Äî
COOP51417	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I have to work this hard! I just have to!
COOP51418	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tamayo has always worked super hard	 right?
COOP51419	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I need to work twice	 no	 a hundred times as
hard to catch up to her!
COOP51421	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But‚Äî
COOP51422	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
COOP51424	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um...?
COOP51426	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But! I need to train...
COOP51428	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	*gasp*
COOP51429	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Fine	 I said that. But Tamayo is definitely
using this time to get ahead of me!
COOP51431	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The Phantom Thieves...
COOP51432	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wanted to fight as a Phantom Thief. So I
started getting in shape...
COOP51433	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If I change people's hearts	 then I can help
everyone who's lost their desires like I did.
COOP51434	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's what I want.
COOP51436	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	How could I!?
COOP51437	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even when I was away from it	 I always loved
it. The truth is I've been dying to practice
again!
COOP51438	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wanna continue baseball if I can. My reason
for quitting doesn't exist anymore.
COOP51439	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't care what form it takes... I just
want baseball in my life again.
COOP51440	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course they are!
COOP51441	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Baseball is important to me	 and so are the
Phantom Thieves. That's how I really feel.
COOP51442	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I can't enjoy baseball at a time
like this.
COOP51443	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's people suffering	 getting their hope
stolen from them	 and I'm supposed to ignore
that so I can toss a ball on a field?
COOP51444	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's impossible!
COOP51445	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Am I supposed to say	 "Not my problem
anymore	 so whatever!"? That's bullshit.
COOP51446	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I want to protect everyone's dreams as a
Phantom Thief!
COOP51447	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If I'm going to have a happy future playing
the sport I love	 then everyone else needs a
happy future too!
COOP51449	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh...
COOP51450	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh. I can't believe I didn't realize that
till now.
COOP51451	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haha... Nice work	 Coach. I never would've
realized without your help	 {NAME2}.
COOP51453	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess I should...
COOP51454	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh. I... finally get it	 I think.
COOP51455	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know what I have to do. I was so laser
focused on beating Tamayo that I couldn't
think straight.
COOP51456	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But everything's gonna be okay now! I know
what to do.
COOP51457	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Excuse me	 can I get a chocolate parfait	
a steak	 melon soda	 omelette rice...
COOP51458	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Also	 add to that some...
COOP51459	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mmm! This parfait is earth-shattering!
COOP51460	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME2}	 I'm so glad I asked you to be my
coach.
COOP51461	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If it were just me	 I would've been
overworking myself non-stop.
COOP51462	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sure it's important to work hard	 but I
forgot how much I need to take breaks
from it.
COOP51463	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 {NAME2}?
COOP51464	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Honestly... I think we both know there's no
way I can beat Tamayo.
COOP51465	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But you've been supporting me like this
despite that...
COOP51466	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess what I'm asking is	 why are you doing
this all for me?
COOP51469	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha... I don't know why I blush when you
say we're a team...
COOP51470	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess it's kinda like how Tomoko and I were
teammates. Hmm	 okay...
COOP51471	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 thanks	 {NAME2}! I'll do my best for
the team!
COOP51474	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Now that stress is gone	 I'm feelin' pretty
hungry! I think it's time we invite some
caramel parfait to this party!
COOP51475	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mmm	 so full! My tank's on F for sure!
COOP51477	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hu‚Äî Uh‚Äî What?
COOP51478	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Um um um um um what!? Wh-What do you mean
by that!?
COOP51480	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A-Are you teasing me? You're not... right!?
COOP51481	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
COOP51482	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah‚Äî I'm‚Äî Uh...
COOP51483	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Happy...
COOP51487	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I-I'm startin' to get hungry again! Time for
another parfait!
COOP51488	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks a lot for today. Really.
COOP51600	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 so... I'm thinking of doing that
challenge with Tamayo.
COOP51601	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do you mind coming with me today?
COOP51602	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you going to spend time with Motoha?
COOP51604	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks. All right	 let's go!
COOP51605	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP51606	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh... Well I need my coach there	 so lemme
know when you're around.
COOP51607	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Sorry to keep you waiting	 Motoha Arai.
COOP51608	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No	 you waited all this time for me. I should
be the one apologizing.
COOP51609	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Let's confirm the rules. We each get three
pitches	 and whoever hits more home runs
wins.
COOP51610	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If I win	 you join my baseball team.
COOP51611	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	But if you win	 I'll give up on you and
apologize sincerely to your coach. Sound
good?
COOP51612	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 fine by me.
COOP51613	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Good. I'll bat first!
COOP51614	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Must be pretty confident if you called me
out here. Too bad I'm about to knock that
confidence right outta the park.
COOP51615	Tamayo Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shida	Haaah!
COOP51616	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	It's not over yet... Next! Haaah!
COOP51617	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tamayo... She's amazing!
COOP51618	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	This last pitch's mine!
COOP51619	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	If you wanna beat me	 you'll have to hit
three home runs.
COOP51620	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	So here's your chance to surrender. What do
you say?
COOP51621	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way. I've already decided. I'm doing this.
COOP51622	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Here I go	 Coach!
COOP51624	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Leave it to me!
COOP51625	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay!
COOP51626	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Next! Hng!
COOP51627	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Last one! Haaah!
COOP51628	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	What the hell was that!? Didn't you show up
because you thought you could win!?
COOP51629	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is the extent of what I can do.
COOP51630	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm glad that I inspired you. But I'm not the
same person I was back then.
COOP51631	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I can't get to your level with a little
practice after quitting the game for so long.
COOP51632	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That just proves how hard you've worked.
COOP51633	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I love baseball	 and I still wanna play. But
I'm not ready just yet.
COOP51634	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	If I'm gonna play alongside you	 I need to
practice a hell of a lot more.
COOP51635	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I hope to compete at your level one day. But
for now	 I can't join your team yet.
COOP51636	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	......
COOP51637	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry if that sounds selfish.
COOP51638	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll keep my promise to you since I lost...
But it'd be best for the both of us if
I wait.
COOP51639	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Motoha Arai... I've always looked up to you
as a baseball player.
COOP51640	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I've always practiced hard in the hopes of
playing like you one day...
COOP51641	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	But now... I'm a better player than you.
COOP51642	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yup.
COOP51643	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I knew full well that no matter how hard I
tried	 I wouldn't be able to beat you... But
I still came to face you.
COOP51644	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Huh...
COOP51645	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Did your coach over there tell you to do
this?
COOP51647	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I see.
COOP51648	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	You still came to compete knowing you'd
lose...
COOP51649	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	That strength must be what inspired me back
then. I remember now...
COOP51650	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Motoha Arai.
COOP51651	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I'm sorry for being selfish. Thanks for
humoring me.
COOP51652	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Not at all... I'm the one who lost my temper
and jumped on board with the competition.
COOP51653	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Your sense for baseball hasn't faded. I'll be
waiting for your comeback.
COOP51654	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks. I'm gonna work hard so I can play
alongside you	 so look forward to it!
COOP51655	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	I'll challenge you again once you've polished
your skills!
COOP51656	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mayo Yoshida	Wahaha! You're my one and only rival after
all	 Motoha Arai!
COOP51657	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew...
COOP51658	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I lost... But I knew that already.
COOP51660	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks!
COOP51661	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Couldn't have done it without you behind
me	 {NAME2}.
COOP51662	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really? Ehehe... Gotta say	 I like being
called cool!
COOP51663	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I got so happy when people would say that
to me in little league! I didn't think I'd get
to hear it again.
COOP51664	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Absolutely not!
COOP51665	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I went through with the competition so I
wouldn't have any regrets.
COOP51666	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know I won't be at Tamayo's level anytime
soon... But I'm gonna work my butt off to get
there!
COOP51667	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've got you here cheering me on after all.
COOP51669	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I'm gonna focus on the Phantom Thieves
first! I wanna be able to throw myself back
into baseball at full strength.
COOP51671	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha	 you got it.
COOP51672	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I won't reach peak coolness till I can steal
a base and the bad guys' hearts	 right!?
COOP51673	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Aghhh! After all that hubbub	 I'm starving.
COOP51674	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 let's hit the diner before going home!
But it's not my cheat day	 so I'll skip the
parfait!
COOP51675	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Time to dig in!
COOP51677	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's all thanks to your support	 {NAME2}.
COOP51678	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks to you	 I made peace with losing.
COOP51679	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm gonna keep doing my best from now on.
And you'll be there for me through it all	
right?
COOP51680	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	See you later.
COOP51681	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I escorted Motoha home.
COOP51800	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you free today? I want you to come with
me somewhere...
COOP51801	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I want you to come with me somewhere.
COOP51802	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you going to spend time with Motoha?
COOP51804	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Great!
COOP51848	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll meet you in front of the school gates!
COOP51805	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave
you to it.
COOP51806	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay.
COOP51807	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Next time!
COOP51808	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I used to come here after losing a match when
I was in little league.
COOP51809	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko and I would shout into the ocean	
We lost!
COOP51810	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then we'd head to the shopping mall over
there to grab ice cream before going home.
COOP51811	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I realized that I didn't do that when I
lost to Tamayo the other day.
COOP51812	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I feel like maybe it wasn't as frustrating
losing this time compared to back then. It's
almost like I'm over it.
COOP51813	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And the reason I can say that now is because
of my coach. You	 {NAME2}.
COOP51814	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you for standing by me through all of
the training and the contest with Tamayo.
COOP51816	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 I seriously can't thank you enough.
Ahaha...
COOP51817	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've always felt like losing was the end of
the world. Like if you lose a tournament	
that's it	 you're done	 you know?
COOP51818	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But this was different. Losing wasn't
the end.
COOP51819	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I understand now. I actually gained something
from this defeat.
COOP51820	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But there are some fights I can't let myself
lose.
COOP51821	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Like... If I lost to Kiuchi	 I never could've
faced Tamayo.
COOP51822	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And in Tamayo's mind	 I was the hurdle she
could never jump over...
COOP51823	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Plus if I had lost to Kiuchi	 even more
people's desires would've been stolen
from them.
COOP51824	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Moving forward	 there will be more fights I
can't afford to lose.
COOP51825	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Once I win those	 I'll face Tamayo again	 and
play catch with Tomoko too...
COOP51826	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm gonna need to work even harder! I swear
I'll keep working hard from here on out!
COOP51828	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And	 so... you know?
COOP51829	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You'll work hard alongside me... right?
COOP51831	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ahaha... Thanks	 {NAME2}!
COOP51832	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's work! Our! Butts! Off!
COOP51833	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 say it with me!
COOP51834	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We'll work! Our! Buuutts! Oooff!
COOP51835	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha.
COOP51836	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 since we came all the way here... Wanna
get some ice cream before we go?
COOP51837	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	One chocolate	 vanilla	 pistachio triple
scoop! Oh	 in a cone please!
COOP51839	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 um...!
COOP51840	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you	 {NAME2}.
COOP51841	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I like being with you. As Phantom Thieves and
otherwise...
COOP51842	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	......
COOP51843	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 since we came all the way here... Wanna
get some ice cream before we go?
COOP51844	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hehe	 good answer. But...
COOP51845	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wanna stay like this just a little longer.
Is that okay?
COOP51846	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks...
COOP58001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 {NAME2}! You free now?
COOP58002	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I was hoping you could help me out with
something.
COOP58004	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Great! All right	 let's get going.
COOP58006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No problem. Maybe next time!
COOP58010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So {NAME2}	 have you ever done sprint
training in the sand before?
COOP58011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You won't gain momentum by kicking your feet
backwards. You'll just get sand everywhere.
COOP58012	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	To go faster	 you need to quickly lift your
thighs to get the next step in.
COOP58013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's why the beach is ideal for training.
COOP58015	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No	 I don't have the leg strength for
that yet.
COOP58016	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 it's been a while so I don't think
now's the right time to get stuck in.
COOP58017	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But I'm gonna start getting back into shape.
COOP58018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wanna be able to sprint on the beach
effortlessly.
COOP58019	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So I was hoping that today you would help me
with my form.
COOP58020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nothing too technical. Just tell me if I'm
making progress or not.
COOP58021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's been years since I tried running at full
speed on the beach.
COOP58022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't hesitate to tell me if you notice
anything.
COOP58023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 Coach	 here I go!
COOP58024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yep	 another perfect day for training. Let's
give it our all!
COOP58040	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The gym seems like the best place to do light
training but...
COOP58041	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The sports teams are taking up most of the
space.
COOP58042	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Any ideas for workouts I can do in this small
corner of the gym?
COOP58043	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Maybe strength training? But which exercise
should I do...?
COOP58045	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 perfect for the glutes and quads.
No pain	 no gain I guess.
COOP58046	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME2}	 could you help me count my reps?
COOP58047	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Back to the basics	 huh. They're not just
good for toning up. Apparently they help with
your posture	 too!
COOP58048	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	{NAME2}	 mind holding my feet down for me?
COOP58049	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sounds effective... and super embarrassing to
do alone!
COOP58050	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Will you join me	 {NAME2}?
COOP58051	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess being surrounded by all these sports
teams is kind of a good thing.
COOP58052	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I mean	 there's no way I can slack off with
all those wandering eyes...
COOP58053	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The thought of being seen like that motivates
me to pull myself together.
COOP58054	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 here I go! Watch me	 Coach!
COOP58055	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 we got a good spot! Let's get straight
to it!
COOP58070	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew... This park is huge. Even just walking
feels like a workout.
COOP58071	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's take a break. Good thing I brought a
drink.
COOP58072	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tada! It's a protein shake!
COOP58073	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	These days	 they've been coming out with all
sorts of flavors to enjoy your protein.
COOP58074	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm only going with the plain one today
though. What flavor would you recommend	
{NAME2}?
COOP58076	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wonder if the chocolate one would taste
like hot chocolate if I mix it with milk?
COOP58077	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A blend of apple	 peach	 and pineapple	 huh?
That's bound to make you feel refreshed.
COOP58078	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I like custard	 but as a protein shake?
Sounds a li'l adventurous for my taste.
COOP58079	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But if Coach {NAME2} recommends it	 then I'll
give it a try.
COOP58080	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Next time we train together	 I'll bring a
shake for you too	 {NAME2}!
COOP58081	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 drink break's over. Time to start
walking again.
COOP58082	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm so tempted to buy ice cream	 but that
definitely won't help me tone up. Gotta
refrain!
COOP58083	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! I bet that's why there's so many dessert
flavored protein shakes!
COOP58084	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	They're for people like me	 who wanna stay in
shape but still crave sweet treats!
COOP58085	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Man	 I'd love it if they had a parfait
flavored shake... Or better yet	 a chocolate
parfait one!
COOP58086	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	With a huge park like this	 there's all sorts
of things you can do.
COOP58100	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I couldn't think of anywhere else to train my
reflexes other than the batting cages.
COOP58101	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But then I remembered shooting games.
COOP58102	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've never really played them before	 but
I've always wanted to try.
COOP58104	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah. Anything's worth trying. So	 you're in	
right?
COOP58105	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You sound confident! You'll have to teach me.
COOP58106	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Training while gaming? Talk about hitting two
birds with one stone!
COOP58107	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I wonder if there are other games that could
also double up as training?
COOP58108	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah	 there's the punching game. I could use my
score to measure progress.
COOP58109	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What else... Crane games could help improve
my observational skills.
COOP58110	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Instead of thinking of it like training	
I should just have fun.
COOP58111	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sometimes instead of pushing yourself	 you
gotta let go!
COOP58112	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 what do you say? You up for a few rounds?
COOP58113	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! The machine I wanted to play seems to be
available!
COOP58131	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Mmm	 everything smells delicious! This is
just what I need after a hunger-inducing
workout!
COOP58132	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's hurry up and order. What should I get?
COOP58133	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Apparently monja contains lots of water and
fiber	 so that means I can eat loads without
gaining weight.
COOP58134	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's perfect to fill up after training! An
athlete once recommended it in a magazine.
COOP58135	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmmm	 what should I get?
COOP58136	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I would totally order mochi too	 but those are
high in carbs.
COOP58138	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right. The main dish is mostly veggies
anyway. A little extra won't cause too much
damage.
COOP58139	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh yeah	 you're right. Cheese is low in
carbs.
COOP58140	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All right	 I'm gonna go with your
recommendation. Let's order!
COOP58141	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 and {NAME2}	 don't hold back on your
order just cause I am.
COOP58142	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even if you get the deluxe monja with every
single topping...
COOP58143	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I promise I won't stare at you resentfully
while you eat!
COOP58144	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...I'll do my best to not even look your way!
COOP58145	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm always starving after moving around a
bunch. Now	 what should I order today?
COOP58160	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 {NAME2}! Could you look at this real
quick?
COOP58161	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's a list of all the new releases on
streaming sites...
COOP58162	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But look at this one. Isn't that the movie
you said you were curious about?
COOP58164	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Your place? As in... Like	 your house?
COOP58165	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess it would be more chill watching it
there! If you really don't mind	 then...?
COOP58167	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 gotcha. Sorry. Let's watch the movie when
you've got time	 then.
COOP58168	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hello?
COOP58169	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 duh. Your parents are on a trip	 right?
So you've got the place to yourself.
COOP58170	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It'd be kinda awkward then... The movie's got
some horror-y bits	 after all.
COOP58171	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You'd probably get all spooked after the
movie	 being home all by yourself	 {NAME2}.
COOP58173	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 sounds like you can deal with horror
pretty well.
COOP58174	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm... actually not so good with those kinds
of movies.
COOP58175	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hahaha	 you've got me there.
COOP58176	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But you can't build courage without pushing
yourself	 or something	 right?
COOP58178	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Y-yeah	 true. It might not be as scary 
if I watch it with you	 {NAME2}...
COOP58179	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh...! T-Thanks... I might need to if it's
that spooky.
COOP58180	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're... pretty close	 huh? Meh	 it is just
us here	 I guess...
COOP58181	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'll hit play	 then	 'kay?
COOP58184	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I kinda wanna munch on something during the
movie. Should we get some popcorn?
COOP59027	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Guess it'd be kinda tough to head there	
huh...?
COOP59900	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way! I really wanted this one!
COOP59901	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you sure I can really have this?
COOP59902	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks	 {NAME2}! I'll return the favor next
time!
COOP59903	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 really?
COOP59904	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you! I was just thinking I wanted one
of this!
COOP59905	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way! I really wanted this one!
COOP59906	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you sure I can really have this?
COOP59907	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks	 {NAME2}! I'll return the favor next
time!
COOP59908	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 really?
COOP59909	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you! I was just thinking I wanted one
of this!
COOP59987	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Where do you wanna go? I'll leave it to you.
COOP59988	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 okay. Well	 let's hang out some other
time.
COOP59989	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay! Then let's get going!
COOP59990	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Maybe we oughta avoid that place? I dunno	
it's like my primal instincts are telling me
to stay away...
COOP59993	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way! I really wanted this one!
COOP59994	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you sure I can really have this?
COOP59995	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thanks	 {NAME2}! I'll return the favor next
time!
COOP59996	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 really?
COOP59997	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you! I was just thinking I wanted one
of this!
COOP60000	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Trying to Look Cool	I figured you'd be showing up soon.
COOP60001	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Trying to Look Cool	What happened to you? You've gained so much
power in such a short span of time.
COOP60003	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Trying to Look Cool	Ah... I see you don't recognize me. I'd
prefer you introduce yourself first	 but...
COOP60004	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Trying to Look Cool	I haven't seen you among the freshmen	 so you
must be an upperclassman. Fine then.
COOP60005	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Trying to Look Cool	I'm Kurotani. <color=#FF423F>Kiyoshi Kurotani</color>	 from the
freshman class.
COOP60007	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 polite to your inferiors	 are you?
There's no need for that. Let me offer
respect where it is due.
COOP60008	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In that vein	 I will call you...
{NAME1}-san. Yes	 that will do nicely.
COOP60009	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Please call me Kiyoshi.
COOP60010	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yes	 indeed... I am more than prepared.
{NAME1}-san...
COOP60011	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	For you to be here now of all times... That
means you've come to see me	 yes?
COOP60013	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh. You're talking to Kiyoshi Kurotani	
remember?
COOP60014	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In that case... It must be fate. An
inevitable result of our respective
circumstances.
COOP60015	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I can't say I fully understand myself. If
pushed	 I suppose I'd call it... fate.
COOP60016	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've been waiting for someone like you.
A chosen one	 guided by destiny.
COOP60017	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 apologies. I should start from the
beginning.
COOP60018	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You are aware of the many threats haunting
this school's hallowed halls	 aren't you?
COOP60020	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wait	 you don't know!? But you're "chosen"!
COOP60021	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	The truth is	 I am also "chosen." Chosen to
protect our school.
COOP60023	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Please	 hear me out! This affects you too.
COOP60024	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Not one to rely solely on my powers alone	
I researched my suspicions day and night	
until I discovered the truth.
COOP60025	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This school is plagued by paranormal
phenomena of all kinds!
COOP60026	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	These days everyone talks about Menaces	 but
I don't care for that sort of thing.
COOP60027	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Mysteries	 strange incidents... Without
determining their cause	 these inexplicable
occurrences haunt the mind	 do they not?
COOP60029	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wonderful	 {NAME1}-san! I'm glad we're on
the same page.
COOP60030	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Excellent	 {NAME1}-san! You've picked up on
my main point.
COOP60031	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	If nothing is done	 the students of this
school will fall prey to the forces of
darkness.
COOP60032	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Somebody has to solve the mysteries
threatening these halls before they can harm
the innocent.
COOP60033	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And that somebody is the chosen one. Ah...
COOP60034	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I suppose it's the chosen ones	 now that I've
found you.
COOP60035	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Well	 perhaps my explanation is still getting
ahead of itself.
COOP60036	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Well	 perhaps my explanation is still getting
ahead of itself.
COOP60037	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Listen	 {NAME1}-san. You and I have been
chosen by the world itself.
COOP60038	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You have a special power	 don't you? It's
hard to put into words	 but...
COOP60039	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san... You possess a multitude of
powers within your singular self	 correct?
COOP60040	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You can't hide it from me. Heheheh...
COOP60042	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 you and I are bound by destiny.
We're kindred spirits	 so to speak.
COOP60043	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And as a fellow chosen one	 I understand.
Everyday life just gets so boring	
doesn't it?
COOP60045	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You don't have to say anything	 I already
know. I understand! And I know how painful
it is...
COOP60046	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So	 to protect our school from the forces
threatening to devour it	 and to fend off the
boredom plaguing us gifted individuals‚Äî
COOP60047	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We shall act as the chosen ones! We don't
stand to lose anything... I think.
COOP60050	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Um	 if you did join me	 I could... give you
some of my favorite books!
COOP60051	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ones that are out of print. The kind you can't
buy anymore. I've got a lot like that.
COOP60052	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So	 please. Accept me as a kindred spirit	
and let us do whatever it takes to protect
this school!
COOP60054	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 thank you!
COOP60057	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm usually in the library after school	 but
let's trade contact info just in case.
COOP60058	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 the "chosen" contact info!
COOP60059	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	All right	 let's leave it here for today.
I'll continue on with my research of the
paranormal.
COOP60060	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 here's the book I promised. Consider
it... proof of our resolve and a memento of
our fated meeting.
COOP60062	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 a cool introduction. As I expected.
COOP60063	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That's fine to start with! We can work
things out together!
COOP60200	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I thought you'd be by soon. We chosen ones
are naturally drawn together after all.
COOP60201	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've identified one of the school's
mysterious incidents	 and I'm ready to go
face it. Are you?
COOP60203	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Hurra‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	
I thought so.
COOP60204	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In that case	 let us proceed at once to the
Harrowed Grounds.
COOP60206	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Time is short. We must hurry! Hopefully we're
not already too late!
COOP60207	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 I see...
COOP60208	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Come to think of it	 I have urgent business
to attend to as well. Let's look into it
next time.
COOP60209	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Here we are. These are the dreaded Harrowed
Grounds.
COOP60210	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Following school rumors and my own research	
I was finally able to confirm its location.
COOP60211	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	My most feared premonition has proven true.
To think it's already progressed this far!
COOP60213	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	See how no plants grow in this spot? This
means his sinister corpse will soon arise!
COOP60215	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In ancient times	 there was a hero who felled
a great demon that had brought ruin to the
world.
COOP60216	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But the demon could not be completely erased.
Therefore	 the hero sealed its corpse away.
COOP60217	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Were that demon to rise again	 we would be
forced to... c-call the police?
COOP60219	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	A warning	 {NAME1}-san. Do not step in that
spot! No matter what!
COOP60221	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	What are you doing!? Wait! Are you being
controlled by the demon!?
COOP60222	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Teacher	What are you kids doing out here?
COOP60223	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Sir	 flee this place! Quickly! The curse will
take you too!
COOP60224	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Teacher	Agh	 they're at it again!
COOP60225	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Teacher	There's a bunch of cat poop over here. You'd
better steer clear if you like having clean
shoes.
COOP60226	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Cat... poop?
COOP60227	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Teacher	We have to clean up this spot every few days.
The grass even stopped growing after a while!
COOP60228	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Then... The Harrowed Grounds...
COOP60229	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Teacher	Someone must be feeding stray cats around
here	 so they keep coming back. Not you	
right? Ah well.
COOP60231	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 I'm sorry!
COOP60232	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I uh	 was just about to let go!
COOP60233	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 I'm sorry. I actually do strength
training every morning.
COOP60234	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So the truth behind the Harrowed Grounds	
one of the school's terrifyingly threatening
mysteries...
COOP60235	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	...was cat poop all along. Though	 I suppose
poop is threatening in its own way...
COOP60236	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Anticlimactic as it may be	 us chosen ones
have uncovered the truth together.
COOP60237	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Let's think of it that way	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP60239	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I wonder if that teacher might be an agent of
some secret organization.
COOP60240	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	The cat poop story could be a cover-up to
hide the truth about the demon's sinister
corpse!
COOP60242	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No	 the chosen ones should not betray a man
who's shown us such kindness.
COOP60243	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No	 we'd better not. We are the chosen ones	
after all.
COOP60244	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 right! Here's your book!
COOP60400	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I was just about to message you. We chosen
ones are naturally drawn together	 aren't we?
COOP60401	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've managed to narrow in on one of the
school's mysterious incidents	 and I'm ready
to face it. Will you join me?
COOP60403	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Yaaa‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	
I expected as much.
COOP60404	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In that case	 let us proceed at once to the
Hall of Lament.
COOP60406	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I appreciate your enthusiasm	 but please do
remember to keep your wits about you.
COOP60407	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Time is short. Let us get going. I'll fill
you in on the details there.
COOP60408	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Is that so...?
COOP60409	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	As a matter of fact	 I have pressing matters
to attend to myself. Let's look into it
another time.
COOP60410	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This is it. The fabled Hall of Lament.
COOP60411	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	According to my investigation	 a woman's
wailing can be heard here after school.
COOP60412	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Apparently those who hear her voice meet with
great misfortune.
COOP60413	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This rumor is well known	 so there haven't
been any recent victims. But we can't leave
this problem to fester.
COOP60414	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm sure it's a resentful spirit manifesting
here. Before it claims another victim	
we must...
COOP60416	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	S-Scared? Not exactly. I'm just not good
with	 you know	 Japanese horror movie stuff?
COOP60417	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I mean	 don't those kinds of entities always
seem to come back even after the case is
solved?
COOP60418	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 I'm sorry. Um... Please let me stay
like this.
COOP60419	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man's Voice	Uhuhu... Uhuhuuu...
COOP60420	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	What was that!?
COOP60421	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man's Voice	Uhuuu... Aaah... Agh!
COOP60422	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Hey	 the sound is getting closer	 isn't it!?
We've been detected by the enemy!
COOP60423	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I know this isn't something people normally
say in real life	 but could you promise me
something?
COOP60425	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No matter what happens to me here...
COOP60426	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Please save yourself	 {NAME1}-san!
COOP60427	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man's Voice	Uwaaaooo... Aaah!
COOP60428	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Run! You promised!
COOP60430	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san...
COOP60431	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Huh!? Oh... That's fine	 but...
COOP60432	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You are joking	 right!?
COOP60433	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wling Girl	Hu... Ah... Haaa!
COOP60434	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Waaagh!?
COOP60435	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Um... Huh...?
COOP60436	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wling Girl	Aaaah!
COOP60437	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Uh	 hey...
COOP60438	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>wling Girl	'Sup?
COOP60439	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So the truth behind the Hall of Lament was...
bawling out your feelings.
COOP60440	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Anyone who hears that wailing is bound to
lose sleep. And sleep deprivation begets
misfortune.
COOP60441	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Um	 can we please keep the truth between the
two of us?
COOP60443	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm sure they're not able to cry their heart
out at home	 so they let their stress out
here.
COOP60444	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	If that hallway remains a threat	 I don't
think anyone will come disturb her.
COOP60445	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's a good thing you were here to help me
find the truth	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP60446	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That much I can say for certain...
COOP60448	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Still	 that stage crying was pretty intense.
I think it's going to haunt my dreams...
COOP60449	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Am I a victim of the Hall of Lament?
COOP60451	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60452	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60600	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I was just about to contact you. The chosen
ones truly are drawn together.
COOP60601	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've discovered one of the school's
mysterious ongoings	 and I'm ready to
investigate. What say you?
COOP60603	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Aweso‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	
of course.
COOP60604	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In that case	 let's hurry and pursue the
mystery of the Assassin's Juice.
COOP60606	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yes	 correct. We are talking about
assassination here. I'm on my guard as well.
COOP60607	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That it does	 {NAME1}-san. I'm on my
guard too.
COOP60608	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This time I should share what I know before
we get there.
COOP60609	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	There's a particular kind of juice sold in
the school shop.
COOP60610	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This juice is always sold out	 so very few
students have actually laid eyes on it.
COOP60612	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Indeed	 which makes it a hot topic. Anyone
actually drinking it is bound to draw
attention.
COOP60613	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	At first	 I thought the same. But there's
more to the story.
COOP60614	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Gaining something many covet can leave a
target on your back.
COOP60615	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We all know how frenzied people can get when
they're after a certain game or special pair
of shoes.
COOP60616	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So here's my theory	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP60617	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's not that no one has ever seen this
juice.
COOP60618	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's that those who've tasted it have
vanished from this world.
COOP60619	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Apologies	 I got a bit carried away there.
COOP60620	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Let's head to the school shop. Today's the
day the juice is delivered.
COOP60621	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 is that right...?
COOP60622	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Actually	 I'm busy too. Let's look into this
next time.
COOP60623	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've confirmed the supply truck's arrival.
The restock must be in progress.
COOP60624	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	If anything occurs	 I expect it to be when
the juice is put out for sale.
COOP60625	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>mid B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Um... The usual...
COOP60626	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Take-kun?
COOP60628	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	<color=#FF423F>Kazuki Take</color>. He's a freshman	 but we're not
in the same class.
COOP60629	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Thanks. See you... next time...
COOP60630	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That box... It can't be!
COOP60632	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	My god	 it was Take-kun! He bought out all of
the juice!
COOP60633	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And it seems he's been buying boxes like this
after every restock recently.
COOP60635	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yes indeed. It was the Assassin's Juice.
COOP60636	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That	 I do not know...
COOP60637	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We must go after Take-kun at once!
COOP60638	K<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rotani's Voice	Take-kun!
COOP60639	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Kurotani-kun and... Who are you?
COOP60640	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 a second year. He is a kindred
spirit. One of the chosen ones.
COOP60641	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	You're really still doing that stuff?
COOP60642	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Incidentally	 that box you're carrying...
It's juice	 correct? Why buy the whole box?
COOP60643	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Oh	 uh... I was really thirsty! I just had to
have this juice!
COOP60644	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Still	 isn't that a bit much? I don't think
you could possibly drink it all alone.
COOP60645	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	......
COOP60646	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's fine	 you can go. Sorry for
stopping you.
COOP60647	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Kazuki Take...
COOP60649	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yes. Solving the mysteries threatening this
school sometimes requires swift judgments
like this.
COOP60650	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We proceed with our investigation	 of course.
We aren't nearly finished yet.
COOP60651	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This mystery keeps getting juicer. Now that
we know Take is the one buying it up	
I believe murder is less likely.
COOP60652	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	After all	 he's clearly alive enough to make
it to school every day. But now we have a new
problem.
COOP60654	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	As you can likely tell by looking at him	
Take-kun isn't the type to make bold moves...
COOP60655	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No matter how much he claims to love juice.
COOP60656	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	To discover why he keeps buying all the
juice	 we must launch Operation X.
COOP60658	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	To find the truth behind Take's juice
craving	 we let him go for now. That is
Operation X.
COOP60659	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Uh	 and the success of this operation will
depend on your participation	 so...
COOP60660	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You won't back out on me now... right?
COOP60662	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's just my intuition	 but I sensed a
strange aura from Take-kun.
COOP60663	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 excuse me. We were going to leave things
here for today	 weren't we?
COOP60665	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60666	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60667	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60669	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60670	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60671	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP60800	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I was just going to message you. We chosen
ones truly are in sync.
COOP60801	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You remember the Assassin's Juice incident	
yes? One of the mysteries threatening our
school?
COOP60802	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Juice restock day is upon us once again.
I'm ready to pursue this mystery. How
about you?
COOP60804	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Yea‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	 I thought
as much.
COOP60805	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Let's proceed to the school shop. Take-kun is
sure to be there too.
COOP60806	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 well...
COOP60807	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Actually	 I have something to do too. Let's
investigate next time.
COOP60808	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've investigated further since last time	
and it's clear Take isn't drinking that
juice.
COOP60809	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So I've been formulating a theory.
COOP60811	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	There's a mastermind using Take to buy up the
juice. I don't know who it is	 but...
COOP60812	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	To find out	 we'll need to follow Take-kun
when he... Hm? Oh	 there he is.
COOP60813	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Um... The usual...
COOP60814	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Let's tail him	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP60815	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It looks like he's heading for the shoe
lockers.
COOP60816	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	He's... leaving the school grounds!?
Take-kun	 you fiend	 what are you up to?
COOP60817	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Voice	Good boy	 Take-chan!
COOP60818	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That voice... Let's go!
COOP60819	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Voice	Look at you	 bringing us the goods again!
COOP60820	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That's...
COOP60821	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Man	 what a haul! We're practically swimming
in this stuff! Bottoms up!
COOP60822	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	Eugh	 this is gross!
COOP60823	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Heh. It's supposed to be gross. It's Durian
au Lait!
COOP60824	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>rogant Boy	It's nasty at first	 but once you get a taste
for it	 the flavor's addictive!
COOP60825	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Um... Do you guys think this could maybe...
be the last time?
COOP60826	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>rogant Boy	What	 don't have the money? Nah	 that can't
be! Your folks have that private practice
dough!
COOP60827	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	They only sell this stuff at the school
store	 so we gotta depend on you	 pal!
You wouldn't let us down now	 right?
COOP60828	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	They only sell this stuff at the school
store	 so we gotta depend on you	 pal!
You wouldn't let us down now	 right?
COOP60829	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	'Less... You made some fancy new friends at
Kokatsu you like better than us?
COOP60830	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	N-No	 that's not it. I'll always be your...
friend...
COOP60831	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	Then we'll be countin' on ya! We wouldn't
wanna see our little friend get hurt	 would
we	 guys?
COOP60832	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So this is the aura I sensed from Take-kun...
COOP60833	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It looks like those three are the
masterminds! This... This is...!
COOP60834	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Isn't this too over-the-top? It's like we're
in an old TV drama.
COOP60835	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Isn't this too over-the-top? It's like we're
in an old TV drama.
COOP60836	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take's Voice	Ah! Ow... S-Stop...
COOP60837	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san...
COOP60839	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wha...?
COOP60840	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 yes! And you watch mine!
COOP60841	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I	 I...
COOP60842	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I...!
COOP60843	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You're right...
COOP60844	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We have to act according to our values. Tough
to be sure	 but such is the path of a chosen
one...
COOP60845	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Witness the might of Kiyoshi Kurotani!
COOP60846	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>rogant Boy	Thinkin' little Take-chan needs a punishment
for insulting our friendship.
COOP60847	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Ah	 this takes me back! Middle school was
fun	 huh?
COOP60848	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Please... stop...
COOP60849	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	Haha. But for real	 don't go too hard on him
this time guys	 all right?
COOP60850	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	F-F-Freeze	 punks!
COOP60851	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Kurotani-kun!?
COOP60852	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>rogant Boy	Uh...
COOP60853	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic Boy	Freeze, punks? What is this	 a cop show?
COOP60854	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	What the hell? You narc on us	 Take-chan?
COOP60855	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	N-No	 I...
COOP60856	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 Take-kun	 take cover! I'm about
to unleash my true power!
COOP60857	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I may suffer some damage too...
COOP60858	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ngh!
COOP60859	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	The hell's wrong with this guy?
COOP60860	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Hiyaaaaaaaaah!
COOP60861	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Whoa! Stop screamin'!
COOP60862	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Hwooooooaaaaaaah!
COOP60863	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Damn	 his screaming's gonna get us busted!
Let's get outta here!
COOP60864	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	Get over here	 Take-chan!
COOP60865	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Ah	 okay...
COOP60866	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	*gasp* *pant* *pant*
COOP60867	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I think I used... too much... power...
COOP60868	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But... I did it	 didn't I? The mystery of the
Assassin's Juice is solved!
COOP60870	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 so what did you think? Wasn't I
glorious?
COOP60871	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 what are you talking about?
COOP60872	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I knew that if worst came to worst	 you'd be
there to back me up	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP60873	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That's why I decided to unleash my power.
This was our victory.
COOP60875	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But even with the mystery solved	 it seems
Take-kun is still under threat.
COOP60876	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	As the one chosen to protect this school	
my duty here has yet to be fulfilled.
COOP60877	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	However	 at this time	 I have no choice but
to rest and recover my power... So...
tired...
COOP68500	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 I've detected another threat	
so I'm going to have to survey the area.
COOP68501	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I need to check out a student hot spot. Can
you come?
COOP68503	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Excellent	 fellow chosen one. Let's go
investigate.
COOP68505	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 I see. Ping me next time you're
available.
COOP68506	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So this is Shibuya! Rumor has it the people
here radiate with the aura of the sun.
COOP68507	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's not the most ideal environment for us
chosen ones	 who battle the forces of
darkness from the shadows...
COOP68509	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Y-Yeah	 I know	 right!? It's not just me!
COOP68510	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah! A-Apologies. I lost my composure for a
second there.
COOP68511	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wh... {NAME1}-san!? I was most certain we
were comrades.
COOP68512	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I... I suppose we can still make this work.
As a warrior of the dark	 I welcome you as my
ally of the light.
COOP68513	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Anyway	 let's start investigating. Let's see
what intel we can gather from the young
people here.
COOP68514	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And keep an ear out for anything that might
be related to the threat.
COOP68515	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ppy-Looking G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl	Oh	 have you tried the new dessert from the
caf√© by the station?
COOP68516	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ppy-Looking G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl	Not yet! We should go get some now!
COOP68517	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	The caf√© by the station... A new dessert...
COOP68518	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 could this be...
COOP68519	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It could be a demonic dessert made to lure in
unsuspecting youths. A new threat!
COOP68520	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This calls for further investigation.
We should go to this caf√© at once!
COOP68522	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Nothing ventured	 nothing gained	 as they
say. We ought to feign naivety and just play
along.
COOP68523	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I-I most certainly do not! This is purely for
the purpose of investigation.
COOP68524	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In any case	 it's best to strike while the
iron is hot. Let's follow those two!
COOP68531	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This is as good as enemy territory to me.
Let's tread carefully while we investigate...
COOP68532	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wow... What a view. This really is the
modern-day Tower of Babel.
COOP68533	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I do worry whether its construction incited
the wrath of the gods	 but...
COOP68534	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 look! That's my neighborhood over there!
I wonder if I can see my house?
COOP68535	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Glad you're having fun.|What about the wrath of god?
COOP68536	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Pardon me. It seems I got a little too
excited.
COOP68537	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So	 can you see your house from here	
{NAME1}-san? Which side would it be?
COOP68538	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	W-Well	 it's not as if there aren't taller
buildings in the world	 is it?
COOP68539	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I presume the deities would focus their
efforts on the largest first. In the
meantime	 let's enjoy the view.
COOP68541	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You know	 there aren't as many people our age
here as I expected.
COOP68542	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And most visitors appear to have come with
their significant other. Do you think we look
out of place?
COOP68543	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Don't worry about it.|Should we hold hands?
COOP68544	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Y-You're right! We're kindred spirits	 after
all... Our bond is stronger than any
couple's.
COOP68545	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Huh!? No	 that would be... You're joking	
right? Very funny	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP68546	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	...You ARE joking	 right?
COOP68547	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ahem! Well	 while we're here	 why don't we
drop by the gift shop on our way out?
COOP68548	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I collect pennants	 you know. I wonder if
they sell one for this place?
COOP68555	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We are about to step foot into what can only
be described as "threat central." Nothing but
nasties as far as the eye can see!
COOP68556	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Shinjuku... It's as shady as the rumors say.
The scent of a threat is thick in the air.
COOP68557	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Proceed with caution	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP68558	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We might run into some conventional crime
before we find the real threat.
COOP68559	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This place gives me the creeps.|It's really not that dangerous.
COOP68560	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Indeed. A moment's negligence here	 and we
could be stripped of all we have.
COOP68561	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 if anything happens to me	
just call the cops	 okay?
COOP68562	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	R-Really? Do you actually come here often	
then?
COOP68563	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 {NAME1}-san	 I knew I could count on
you! Especially today it seems.
COOP68564	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In any case	 I've heard there's a store here
that sells highly specialized books.
COOP68565	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I must admit	 I have quite the discerning eye
when it comes to reading material	 so it
caught my interest.
COOP68566	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Does it not seem like the kind of place where
we could uncover information on the threat?
COOP68567	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I heard there's a theater that shows cult
classics	 and a store with luxury plant food!
COOP68568	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh... I suppose even I can't help but be
enticed by the darkness of temptation...
COOP68569	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah	 no adult stores though	 got it? Let's
keep our survey within the bounds of the law.
COOP68576	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It stinks of festering demons here... Always
gives me the creeps.
COOP68577	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wow... I knew about the dome	 but I didn't
know there was a park like this too.
COOP68578	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I have no interest in sports	 but this looks
like fun...
COOP68579	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	...Ahem. Of course	 we didn't come here to
play around.
COOP68580	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Our investigation comes first and foremost.
Now	 let's gather information from the young
visitors.
COOP68581	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	What about the attractions?|Let's ride the rollercoaster first.
COOP68582	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Well	 when you put it that way	 I suppose
a survey of the entire park is highly
warranted.
COOP68583	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We really ought to test the safety of these
rides ourselves!
COOP68584	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	R-Really? Well	 if you insist	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP68585	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Then I suppose I have no choice but to join
you. Us kindred spirits must always stick
together.
COOP68586	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	What shall we try first	 then? Maybe we
should get a park pass?
COOP68587	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	AAAAAA==
COOP68588	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	P-Please	 {NAME1}-san. The fate of our
mission depends on it. Really.
COOP68589	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You really like rollercoasters	 don't you?
And... I have also been curious to try
it out!
COOP68590	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	All right	 this park won't investigate
itself. Let's start from that ride over
there!
COOP68597	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No new attractions	 huh. Wouldn't be
surprised if we found a dangerous spirit
lurking between its steel walls...
COOP68598	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And here we are. This noodle place has been
the talk of the school lately...
COOP68599	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Places like this are great for eavesdropping
on other customers.
COOP68600	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That's the best way to get hold of new
information. What do you say?
COOP68601	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	You're a genius!|I'm hungry...
COOP68602	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Right? Being a slow eater like myself has its
perks‚Äîuh	 I mean	 never mind.
COOP68603	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Understandable	 but we're here to
investigate	 remember?
COOP68604	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	All right	 we'd better get in line too. Keep
your ears open in the queue!
COOP68605	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So this is the infamous shoyu chicken broth!
What a beautiful clear soup!
COOP68606	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm glad it's packed with bean sprouts. The
crunchy texture really stands out.
COOP68607	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	When it comes to the egg	 some prefer it
with	 but I for one	 shall go without. The
reason being...
COOP68609	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 we shouldn't let the noodles get too
soft! Let's dig in	 {NAME1}-san!
COOP68616	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Now	 what to do for today's investigation...
Do we follow the beaten path or try something
new? That is the question.
COOP68619	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I-Is this...? Wow	 you really pegged me down
to a T!
COOP68620	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	How do you do it	 {NAME1}-san? It's like you
can see right through me.
COOP68621	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yes	 I'll gladly accept. How can I turn down
such a kind offer? 
COOP68622	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Huh	 you're giving this to me...?
COOP68623	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	T-Thanks. I don't really get gifts	 so...
It means a lot.
COOP70007	???	You there! Excuse me!
COOP70008	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	Over here!
COOP70009	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	May I have your land? I'll pay you for it!
COOP70011	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	You need more money? Here's more!
COOP70012	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	Ahaha. The pleasure of expanding your land
holdings... There's nothing quite like it.
COOP70013	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	The feeling of infinite possibility once
you've cleared it for farming... It's
irresistible!
COOP70014	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	Nothing's better than a huge plot of open
land!
COOP70016	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	It sure is! I'm on cloud nine!
COOP70017	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	Oh my goodness! I forgot to introduce myself.
COOP70018	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	What?
COOP70019	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	Oh no! I haven't introduced myself yet.
COOP70020	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl with Wads of C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>sh	My name is <color=#FF423F>Yui</color>. Pleased to make your
acquaintance.
COOP61000	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I was just planning to contact you. The
chosen ones just can't be kept apart	
can they?
COOP61001	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	There's something I'd like your help with
today	 if that's all right.
COOP61003	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Thank goodne‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	
as expected.
COOP61004	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Now let us make haste. Follow me!
COOP61005	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 all right...
COOP61006	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Silly me	 I'm also extremely busy at the
moment... Let's look into it later.
COOP61007	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No one actually uses the audiovisual room
nowadays.
COOP61008	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Everyone has their own smartphone or tablet
close at hand after all.
COOP61009	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But that's not the only reason no one
comes here...
COOP61011	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Years ago	 a female student entered this room
to shut off the lights.
COOP61012	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In a twist of misfortune	 she became locked
inside.
COOP61013	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But the lab had already fallen out of use
back then.
COOP61014	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No one knew the girl was trapped inside	
and eventually she starved to death.
COOP61015	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Such is the strange tale of the Evil AV Room
where we stand now.
COOP61017	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 we will investigate of course.
However...
COOP61018	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 that's not all!
COOP61019	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 you see right through me. I suppose I
can't hide such things from a kindred spirit.
COOP61020	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	This morning	 I found a love letter from a
female student in my shoe locker.
COOP61021	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It said to meet her in the audiovisual room
today after classes.
COOP61022	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I've never experienced something like this
before	 so I wasn't sure how to proceed.
COOP61023	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So I thought it would be best if you were
present for this	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP61025	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Thanks	 {NAME1}-san! You're always so quick
on the uptake.
COOP61026	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Don't worry! As long as you conceal yourself
in that locker over there	 we...
COOP61027	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I know. And to take place here of all places.
COOP61028	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Hey!
COOP61030	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ah! It won't open!
COOP61031	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No way! Not the other door too!
COOP61032	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No! Is this the curse of the Evil AV Room!?
COOP61034	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Y-Yes	 you're right! Calm down first. As one
of the chosen ones I must maintain composure!
COOP61035	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Y-Yes	 you're right. We chosen ones must
concoct a plan to escape this predicament!
COOP61036	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Huh? You don't mean... Someone discovered our
identities and laid a trap for us!?
COOP61037	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We must think this through rationally. The
two of us have the power to overcome any
trial.
COOP61038	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Now	 how to get out... Oh! That could work!
COOP61039	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	*pant* We're out! Thank god.
COOP61040	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	With our powers combined	 we've overcome the
curse of the Evil AV Room!
COOP61042	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We can't allow ourselves to get trapped
again! Let's get out of this place
immediately!
COOP61043	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Huh!? Ah!
COOP61044	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Wait	 Take-kun? Why would he...
COOP61045	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	In any case	 with your help we managed to
slip from the Evil AV Room's cursed grasp.
COOP61046	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So here is your usual compensation. Please	
take it.
COOP61048	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I suppose my first ever love letter also
slipped from my grasp...
COOP61200	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I was just about to send you a message	
but it seems fate has drawn us chosen ones
together.
COOP61201	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	There's something I'd like your help with
today	 if you're available.
COOP61203	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Wooho‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	
that's what I thought you'd say.
COOP61204	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	About what happened with Take-kun at the
AV Room... We need to ask him why he did that
to us	 right?
COOP61205	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	However	 I get the feeling that he's been
avoiding me ever since the incident.
COOP61206	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So that's where you come in	 {NAME1}-san...
COOP61207	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh...
COOP61208	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Well	 I have something to do too. Let's do
this another time.
COOP61209	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Take-kun. Do you have a minute?
COOP61210	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	All right	 fine.
COOP61211	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	I'm sorry I got you guys involved in this.
COOP61212	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	They told me I had to do something bad to
Kurotani-kun and take a video of it.
COOP61213	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Do you mean the three guys from before?
COOP61214	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	They were classmates of mine in middle
school.
COOP61215	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	School and family stuff has been rough for
them lately	 so they've been on edge.
COOP61216	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	I thought if I sucked it up and just let them
blow off steam	 they'd go back to being the
good guys they used to be.
COOP61218	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We may understand	 but that doesn't mean
we agree.
COOP61219	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san is right. How long are you going
to sacrifice yourself for them?
COOP61220	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yeah. I don't really know your history with
them	 but they didn't seem like good guys
from where we were standing.
COOP61221	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Anyway	 they've crossed the line now.
COOP61222	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	If things continue like this	 it's just going
to get worse for you. Are you okay with that?
COOP61223	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	I	 I don't...
COOP61224	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	As the chosen protectors of this school	
we cannot let this go on. Agreed?
COOP61226	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yes! I knew you would understand	
{NAME1}-san.
COOP61227	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I understand your point	 {NAME1}-san.
However!
COOP61228	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san... No	 I can't let this stand.
COOP61229	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	As the chosen ones	 we must see that justice
is made manifest!
COOP61230	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	If you "make justice manifest	 what happens
to my friends?
COOP61231,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Huh?
COOP61232,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,What? They did something bad so they should
get what's coming to them?
COOP61233,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,That's what you're getting at, isn't it?
COOP61234,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,No, that's not what I...
COOP61235,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,I know they probably look like bad guys to
the two of you.
COOP61236,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,But they're my friends.
COOP61237,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,They've gotten weird recently, but... They're
really not bad people!
COOP61238,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,But I guess you're too self-righteous to get
that, Kurotani-kun.
COOP61239,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Take-kun...
COOP61240,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,Kurotani-kun, do you ever think of anyone but
yourself?
COOP61241,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I just... Take-kun...
COOP61243,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Huh? Ah, well yes, I suppose it was.
COOP61244,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I um, suppose he has... I didn't expect him
to defend them like that.
COOP61245,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,N-No, of course not...
Ah, wait, I guess he did.
COOP61246,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Thank you, {NAME1}-san.
COOP61247,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,To be honest, this was such an unexpected
development that I haven't quite
processed it.
COOP61248,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I think I'll need some time to think over
Take-kun's words.
COOP61249,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,And I don't think it's right for us to act on
this without his consent either...
COOP61251,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I suppose that's it for today. Thank you for
your time, {NAME1}-san.
COOP61400,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Oh, {NAME1}-san. Apologies. I didn't see you
there.
COOP61401,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I was just planning to message you actually.
COOP61402,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Sorry to bug you, but there's something I'd
like to talk about.
COOP61404,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Really!? Yea‚Äî*cough* Ahem! I mean, excellent.
COOP61405,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,We can't talk here, so let's go elsewhere.
COOP61406,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Ah...
COOP61407,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Um, actually there's a matter in need of my
urgent attention, so we'll have to do this
another time...
COOP61408,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Ah. A storm is brewing deep within
my heart today...
COOP61409,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,{NAME1}-san, please, have a drink.
COOP61410,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,When I was a child, I was quite sickly.
COOP61411,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Due to my frequent hospitalizations, I was
never able to make any real friends.
COOP61412,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,The main thing that got me interested in the
outside world was books about the paranormal.
COOP61413,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,And I always felt like I could see things
normal people could not.
COOP61414,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Well, fortunately, as I grew older my
physical health improved.
COOP61415,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,But my ability to make friends did not.
COOP61417,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I'm sorry. That was the only way I could
think to approach you.
COOP61418,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I had this intuitive feeling that I could get
along with you.
COOP61419,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Embarrassing as it is... it's all true.
COOP61420,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Take-kun's words hit me hard.
COOP61421,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,It's true that I've never altered my actions
out of concern for someone else.
COOP61422,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Maybe that means I don't have the right to
criticize Take-kun after all.
COOP61424,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,{NAME1}-san... Thank you. You're right,
I have to do what I know is right.
COOP61425,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Of course not! Kiyoshi Kurotani is not a man
who meekly does as he's told.
COOP61426,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I know, right!? Take-kun isn't dealing with
what's happening to him, don't you think?
COOP61427,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,What's going on with those guys isn't right.
That's not what friendship should be like.
COOP61428,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,No matter what he thinks of me, I still want
to save Take-kun.
COOP61429,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Even if it makes him hate me in the end.
COOP61431,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Ah, I feel much more confident about all this
after talking with you, {NAME1}-san!
COOP61432,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Here's your book for today. You'll keep
helping me with Take-kun, right?
COOP61433,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I received a Rare Book
from Kurotani...
COOP61434,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Now that I think of it, you're the first
person I've ever opened up to about my
childhood, {NAME1}-san.
COOP61435,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,It's... a bit of a relief actually.
COOP61436,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I'm really glad we talked today. Now,
drink up!
COOP61600,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I was about to message you. I was hoping
you'd help me with Take-kun...
COOP61602,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Really!? Huzza‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean, just
as I thought.
COOP61603,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,So could you come with me right now?
COOP61604,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Oh, right...
COOP61605,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Actually, I'm too busy right now anyway.
Let's do this later.
COOP61606,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,So, apparently Take-kun is still buying up
all of that juice.
COOP61607,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Luckily, they're restocking today. I suspect
he'll be here soon.
COOP61608,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,*sigh* I'm so sick of this...
COOP61609,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Take-kun!
COOP61610,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,Huh!? Kurotani-kun...
COOP61611,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,If you don't want to do this anymore,
then don't.
COOP61612,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,B-But...
COOP61613,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I understand what you were saying before.
Actually, I'd be lying if I said I understand
completely.
COOP61614,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,Because I've never had any friends to defend.
COOP61615,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,Kurotani-kun...
COOP61616,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,But even so, I can't just leave you in this
situation.
COOP61617,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,So let's settle this today, once and for all!
Take us to your friends, Take-kun.
COOP61618,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,......
COOP61619,L<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>ud Boy,Huh? Take-chan, what's this all about?
COOP61620,Sar<#000000,c,#FFFFFF>astic B<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>y,Where's our juice? You were supposed to bring
it today.
COOP61621,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I told him not to.
COOP61622,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,You need to stop doing this to Take-kun.
This is just bullying.
COOP61623,A<#000000,r,#FFFFFF>rogant Boy,Stay out of this, dumbass. We're talking to
Take-chan.
COOP61624,L<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>ud Boy,You think you can just walk in here and talk
shit? You oughta watch yourself!
COOP61625,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,I-I'm not scared of your threats! If you're
gonna hit me, go ahead and try it!
COOP61626,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,AAAAAA==
COOP61627,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,AAAAAA==
COOP61629,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,No, I can't let you get involved in this...
COOP61630,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,AAAAAA==
COOP61631,Kiyoshi Kur<#000000,o,#FFFFFF>tani,AAAAAA==
COOP61632,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,......
COOP61634,K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>zuki Take,Because" you're his friend?
COOP61635	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Because you're on his side?
COOP61636	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Because you're kindred spirits?
COOP61637	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	You're saying you believe in him?
COOP61638	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Then	 I... I...!
COOP61639	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Enough!
COOP61640	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>rogant Boy	Whoa	 Take-chan...?
COOP61641	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	I've kept quiet because I know things are
hard for you guys	 but this has gone too far!
COOP61643	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Boy	AAAAAA==
COOP61645	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	I-I'm... I'm Kurotani-kun's friend	 too!
COOP61646	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We're... friends?
COOP61647	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	Go ahead	 bully me. C'mon	 do it!
COOP61648	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Male S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	Take-chan...
COOP61649	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rcastic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	Um	 we didn't really mean to...
COOP61650	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>rogant Boy	Hey	 uh	 let's get outta here.
COOP61651	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 Take-kun... Thanks.
COOP61652	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ahhh	 I was really scared for a minute there.
COOP61654	K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>zuki Take	......
COOP61655	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Friends	 huh...
COOP61800	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I was about to contact you. I have something
to tell you about the Take-kun situation...
COOP61802	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Really!? Yippe‚Äî *cough* Ahem! I mean	
I figured you'd say that.
COOP61803	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Can we go talk for a bit	 then?
COOP61804	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 really?
COOP61805	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Well	 I actually have something to do too	
so let's talk another time...
COOP61806	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm sure you could already guess	 but...
COOP61807	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We're celebrating today. My treat.
COOP61808	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Apparently those three apologized to Take-kun
after that.
COOP61809	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	They stopped the bullying	 and Take-kun says
he can speak his mind to them again.
COOP61810	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm so relieved. Our efforts have borne
fruit.
COOP61812	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's all thanks to you	 {NAME1}-san. I never
could have managed this alone.
COOP61813	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I know. But I think Take-kun will be able to
stand up for himself from now on.
COOP61814	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Heh	 that did happen. Are you still holding
that against them?
COOP61815	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Anyway	 it seems like Take-kun rethought some
things after he saw the way you looked out
for me.
COOP61816	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I don't think he's going to put up with bad
treatment from his friends anymore. So that's
a relief.
COOP61817	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I know I said before that I don't fully
understand friendship...
COOP61818	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But I think I've realized some things after
all of this.
COOP61820	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	There isn't one right way to be a good
friend.
COOP61821	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I don't think I could explain it succinctly.
COOP61822	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's true. He's the one who taught me what it
means to be someone's friend.
COOP61823	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Friends might step back and support you from
the side-lines	 like you did...
COOP61824	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Or they might step in to take a blow for you	
like Take-kun did. Both are true signs of
friendship.
COOP61825	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm really glad that Take-kun and I became
friends in the end.
COOP61826	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I think I'm realizing that friendships really
depend on the way you treat the other person.
COOP61827	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	That's one of the things I've learned from
you	 {NAME1}-san.
COOP61829	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	There are people out there willing to be
friends with me.
COOP61830	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It doesn't have to be just me and my books
and urban legends against the universe
anymore.
COOP61831	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I feel like a whole new world has opened up
for me.
COOP61832	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So it is with extra special thanks that I
give you this rare book.
COOP61834	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 but I do still want to continue our
investigations together. Is that all right
with you	 {NAME1}-san?
COOP61835	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We are the chosen ones after all.
COOP61836	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	And we're not only friends	 but kindred
spirits reunited from our past lives!
COOP70241	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	Oh	 you. Uh... Been a while.
COOP70242	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	Welp	 bye.
COOP70245	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	Hey...
COOP70246	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	Don't you get tired being around that? She
scares me a little	 honestly.
COOP70247	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	I mean	 I guess if you don't mind then
it's fine.
COOP70248	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	Later.
COOP70427	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Man	Don't you get tired being around that? She
scares me a little	 honestly.
COOP70808	Off<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ce Worker-Like Woman	Are you	 by any chance...
COOP70810	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	N-No	 I'm not Yui! I'm her friend!
COOP70811	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	Oh yes	 I am. If you know that	 you
must be...
COOP70812	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	Ah	 Yui's told me about you.
COOP70813	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	It's nice you're willing to use that name in
real life as well. I'm glad you took to it.
COOP70814	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	You're younger than me. Oh boy...
COOP70815	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	Oh god	 did you think I'd be the same age
as you?
COOP70816	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	You must have. If you didn't	 you wouldn't
have come.
COOP70817	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	I'm sure you didn't expect an adult	 haha...
COOP70818	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	Ummm	 should we cancel?
COOP70819	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	But I guess you already came all the
way here...
COOP70820	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	Well	 let's just go inside.
COOP70821	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	Let's start over.
COOP70822	O<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>fice Worker-Like Woman	My name is <color=#FF423F>Musubi Matsukata</color>. I'm an office
worker.
COOP70824	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Haha... Thank you.
COOP70825	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Haha... You must be surprised.
COOP70826	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	You showed up only to find a grown adult
waiting for you.
COOP70827	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Oh yes	 she's doing well. She'll be on the
farm again today	 I'm sure.
COOP70828	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Ummm	 so your name is...
COOP70829	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	{PLAYER_NAME}? I see.
COOP70830	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	And you seem to be a high school student.
COOP70831	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Well	 it's okay. We're just having burgers.
COOP70832	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I work for an IT company. Our office is
actually right here in Shibuya.
COOP70833	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Today	 I was dealing with a system-wide
issue. I didn't even have time to eat.
COOP70834	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	But then you invited me	 so I took off for
lunch break and here I am.
COOP70835	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	We should hurry up and order. I'll have a
large hamburger and fries.
COOP70836	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	This is massive!
COOP70837	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	We could have ordered just one for both
of us.
COOP70839	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'm full... I couldn't eat another bite.
COOP70840	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	The french fries were delicious.
COOP70841	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I bet their potatoes were grown on a
magnificent farm.
COOP70842	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'm sure this isn't all that interesting to
you	 but I actually grew up on a farm.
COOP70843	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	It's up in the mountains	 so it takes over an
hour by bus to get there.
COOP70844	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	It's really the middle of nowhere	 so in
terms of finding a job	 it was either move
to the city or become a farmer.
COOP70845	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	But I absolutely can't stand insects. I hate
their creepy crawly little legs.
COOP70846	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	So I decided to move to the city.
COOP70847	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	There are days like today where I'm so busy
that I don't even have time to eat.
COOP70848	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Sometimes I think that working on the farm at
my parents' place wouldn't be so bad.
COOP70849	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	When Yui started doing virtual farming	 I was
envious.
COOP70850	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Yui tells me she has an absolute blast
growing crops with you.
COOP70851	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Like me	 she doesn't have many friends.
I hope you'll continue to be friends
with her.
COOP70852	Musubi Matsu<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ata	Hahaha...
COOP70854	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Hello	 this is Matsukata. Yes. Understood.
COOP70855	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Sorry. That was my office. They need me back.
COOP70856	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	We'll have to call it here.
COOP70858	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	The miseries of the working world. Haha...
COOP70859	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	She should be at the farm later. I hope
you'll see her there.
COOP70860	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Don't worry about it. I invited you.
COOP70861	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	As an adult with a full-time job	 I can't ask
a high school kid to pay.
COOP70862	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	See you later.

COOP71410	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>i's Voice	Russet! You're here! One moment!
COOP71605	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I finished work a little early	 so I thought
I'd invite you out.
COOP71606	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'm glad you agreed to come. Oh	 let me get
you some coffee.
COOP71607	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'll just pop over to the convenience store
there.
COOP71608	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Remember when Yui couldn't go to the fields
for a while?
COOP71609	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	You know	 back during the mole infestation?
COOP71610	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I was dealing with a lot then as well.
I practically lived at the office.
COOP71611	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	It all started when one of my colleagues
made a mistake and then disappeared into
thin air.
COOP71612	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	They're still radio silent even now. Hahaha.
COOP71613	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	At that time	 I felt like I just hated
everything.
COOP71614	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	So	 I was really frustrated that there was
trouble to deal with on our farm as well.
COOP71615	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Anyway	 that's how I was feeling at the time.
COOP71616	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	But when I happened to log back in...
COOP71617	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I found that you had taken care of the fields
for me.
COOP71618	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	When I saw that	 I felt ashamed of myself for
whining about how bad I have it.
COOP71619	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP71620	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I made up my mind that I'd do everything in
my power to fix things for myself!
COOP71621	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	And somehow I dug myself out of the heap
I was buried under.
COOP71622	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	So basically what I'm trying to say is	
I want to thank you.
COOP71623	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Getting to have peace of mind is really
important to me.
COOP71624	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Now that I have some free time	 I've even
been thinking about growing something at
my place.
COOP71625	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'm planning to go to the flower shop after
this. Would you mind coming along and giving
me some advice?
COOP71627	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Thanks!
COOP71628	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	There's a flower shop in the underground
mall. Let's go.
COOP71629	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Wow. For a small store	 it sure has a lot of
options.
COOP71630	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Any ideas to help me choose what to get?
COOP71632	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Right. My situation's gotten better	 but I
shouldn't get a plant that needs too much
attention to survive.
COOP71633	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	This one... Ah	 I have to water it both in
the morning and afternoon. That's a bit of
a hassle.
COOP71634	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Wait	 there's a device that waters your
plants for you!? Oh	 but it's pretty
expensive.
COOP71635	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Oh	 that's not a problem. My room gets plenty
of sunlight.
COOP71636	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'm the type who can't wake up in the morning
unless there's sunlight coming through the
window.
COOP71637	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	So what should I buy? This? Ah	 no.
COOP71638	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	This one is sensitive to strong sunlight.
Don't think we'll get along.
COOP71639	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	You mean I should pick on instinct? Hmm...
COOP71640	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Okay	 this one!
COOP71641	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Whoa	 pricey! How is a plant that expensive?
Haha... I can't afford that.
COOP71642	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I see. Maybe this one will do then.
COOP71643	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Hmmm. Basil seedlings...
COOP71644	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Basil is pretty nice. You can use it in pasta
and stuff.
COOP71645	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'll go with this. Thanks	 {NAME1}-san.
I couldn't have made this choice without you.
COOP71646	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'll do everything in my power to keep it
healthy.
COOP71648	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I will. And I'm ready to deal with any gross
bugs that... Oh wait	 I lied. I totally
forgot.
COOP71649	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Oh! How stupid am I!? I forgot the most
important thing!
COOP71650	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I'll have to buy some insect repellent.
COOP71651	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	This should do the trick.
COOP71652	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	......
COOP71653	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	You know	 I have to train a new employee
who's joining the company tomorrow.
COOP71654	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I know I can't avoid it	 but I'm really not
good with people.
COOP71655	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	But I'll try my best	 just like I will with
this basil.
COOP71657	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	*yawn*
COOP71658	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Sorry. My internal clock has been way out of
whack since everything got crazy with work.
COOP71659	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Maybe taking care of this plant will help me
get back into a healthier rhythm.
COOP71660	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I think I'll try to go to bed early today.
COOP71661	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	Let's call it here. Thank you for
accompanying me.
COOP71662	M<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>subi Matsukata	I hope to see you on the farm.
COOP71850	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	An online world? ...I see	 a transient
electronic realm separated from reality.
COOP71851	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Places such as this may contain dormant
desires that cannot be attained in the
real world.
COOP71852	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This could be an opportunity to refine your
own desires. There is no harm in giving it
a try.
COOP78110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you going to log on to
Harvest World Online?
COOP78111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That friend of yours does not appear to be
online today...
COOP78112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Regardless of whether you meet or not	 that

COOP80800	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Hey	 {NAME1}-kun. Are you busy today?
COOP80801	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've um... found a part-time job. I thought
we could check it out together maybe?
COOP80803	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? Great!
COOP80804	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I was a little nervous about going by myself
today...
COOP80805	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well	 let's just go and see!
COOP80806	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah... All right. Um	 sorry for asking out of
the blue.
COOP80807	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I	 um... I don't come to shops like this a
lot. Sports shops	 sure. Well	 back before...
You know... Haha.
COOP80809	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The places we worked at before were all
stores I've been to myself.
COOP80810	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I wanted to try working someplace I wasn't
used to	 so I chose this place.
COOP80811	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm glad you came with me	 {NAME1}-kun...
COOP80812	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't think I could've done this on
my own...
COOP80813	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So many different accessories...
COOP80814	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I haven't worn stuff like this before	 so I'm
kind of lost...
COOP80815	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! But since I'm working here	 I should wear
something to show off the product	 right!?
COOP80816	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 how is this one? Does it look okay on me?
COOP80818	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? You think so!? Oh wow... Maybe I'll
buy these on the way out.
COOP80819	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Subdued would be better? I'll	 uh	 keep
that in mind!
COOP80820	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What? Like	 as a set!? Hmmm	 I wonder if
I have enough for both...
COOP80821	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe... It's a good thing I asked you.
COOP80822	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This stuff isn't exactly my forte	 but with
you here	 {NAME1}...
COOP80823	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I think it'll be just fine.
COOP80824	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	When I first started these jobs	 I felt like
I was in some sort of weird dream.
COOP80825	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Like a lucid dream	 where you suddenly
realize you're in it.
COOP80826	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'd think to myself	 "What am I doing in this
shop? Shouldn't I be on the field?"
COOP80827	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I have to wake up. I have to eat breakfast
and get to morning training. I felt
panicked.
COOP80828	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But I could never wake up...
COOP80829	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	For a while	 I had trouble knowing if I was
even awake or not.
COOP80830	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then somewhere along the way	 I started to
feel like...
COOP80831	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...me aiming for the pros was the part that
had all been a dream.
COOP80832	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This whole thing would've been a nightmare
had I gone through it by myself.
COOP80833	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But seeing you at my side...
COOP80834	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...helped bring me back to reality.
COOP80835	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Lately	 working these jobs doesn't feel so
unreal anymore. So	 um...
COOP80836	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm just really glad you're here	
{NAME1}-kun.
COOP80838	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP80839	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Not true. Having you here gives me courage.
COOP80840	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah	 I think you're right! If things keep
going like this	 then one day...!
COOP80841	R<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>wdy Female Cus<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>omer	Oh hey	 isn't this the accessory that was all
over social media for a while?
COOP80842	R<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>wdy Female Cus<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>omer	That figure skater wore it in her off time.
COOP80843	R<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>wdy Female Cus<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>omer	What was her name again? You know	 the one
that fell off the face of the earth.
COOP80844	W<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ary Fe<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ale Customer	Huh? Who? Did she retire or something?
COOP80845	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's right. Kotone-san used to wear this...
Even I heard about that. It was everywhere.
COOP80846	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Look how pretty it is. Something like that
wouldn't suit me at all.
COOP80847	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I wonder how Kotone-san's doing...
COOP80848	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Unlike me	 it sounds like her injury might
recover completely with rehabilitation.
COOP80849	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She said she wanted to go back soon if
she could.
COOP80851	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah... I know part of me's projecting my own
worries onto her	 but still...
COOP80852	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I... don't really know.
COOP80853	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ahaha... We probably shouldn't. I think we'd
just get in the way.
COOP80854	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still	 I'd like to do anything I can to offer
her some support.
COOP80855	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't want Kotone-san to feel the pain of
being unable to return to what you love....
COOP80856	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She said she comes around Shibuya Station a
lot	 right? I hope we get to see her again...
COOP80857	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If it's all right with you	 {NAME1}-kun	
would you mind coming to work with me again
sometime?
COOP80859	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway	 we've got a job to do! Better focus
on our work.
COOP80860	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Welcome!
COOP81000	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hi	 {NAME1}-kun. Are you free today?
COOP81001	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I found a nice-looking job in Shibuya	 and
thought we could go check it out.
COOP81003	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? Okay	 then let's go! This time we're
working at a flower shop!
COOP81004	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah	 okay. No worries	 then. Sorry for asking
so suddenly.
COOP81005	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's much harder to work at a flower shop
than one might think.
COOP81006	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I wanted to be a florist at one point	 you
know. Back in kindergarten.
COOP81007	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wanted to run a cr√™perie too now that I think
about it. I was a greedy little gremlin	 huh?
COOP81008	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But working here now is totally different
than what I imagined as a kid.
COOP81009	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I had this image of making customers smile
with these beautiful bouquets of flowers...
COOP81010	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But boxes of flowers and potted plants weigh
a ton! And making bouquets is exhausting.
COOP81011	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's been a while since I've done heavy
labor like this. Reminds me of my baseball
training.
COOP81013	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huh... Now that you mention it	 maybe?
COOP81014	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yep	 totally good! If anything	 this makes
for some good rehab.
COOP81015	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmmm... Well	 when you put it that way	
I'd better put my back into it	 huh?
COOP81016	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Ah... Pardon me.
COOP81017	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 Kotone-san!
COOP81018	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh! Tomoko-san! And {NAME2}-kun! You're
working here today?
COOP81019	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yessiree! Today you're talking to a couple of
florists! What can we do for you?
COOP81020	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Would you happen to have any	 um	 chamomile?
I'd like to make a bouquet out of some.
COOP81021	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmm	 chamomile... We have some left in stock	
but not much	 to be honest.
COOP81022	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	About how big of a bouquet were you thinking?
Just to give us an idea.
COOP81023	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	How big? Hmmm... About... this size?
COOP81024	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yikes... That's pretty big! When would you
need it by?
COOP81025	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Today? If possible...
COOP81026	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Today!?
COOP81027	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I'm sorry. It isn't feasible	 is it?
I shouldn't have made such a big request
so suddenly...
COOP81028	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 is there a specific reason you need it
today	 if you don't mind me asking?
COOP81029	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Yesterday I had some... words with my coach.
Okay	 a fight	 actually.
COOP81030	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	When I think back on it calmly	 I was in the
wrong. So I'd really like to offer the
bouquet today if I can.
COOP81031	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	For now I'll take as many chamomiles as you
have. Then I'll try filling out the bouquet
at other shops.
COOP81032	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hold on a second!
COOP81033	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Huh?
COOP81034	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 say	 {NAME1}-kun... Do you think we can
help her out with those chamomiles somehow?
COOP81035	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Kotone-san really needs them	 right? And I
really want to help her. We have to do
something...
COOP81037	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I knew I could count on you!
COOP81038	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Never you fear	 I have a plan! There should
still be enough time to pull it off.
COOP81039	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You're right! We're a couple of pros today!
We've got this!
COOP81040	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Could you give us a little time? I promise
we'll make it happen!
COOP81041	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Ah	 well... I do have the time	 but... Are
you	 um	 sure you don't mind?
COOP81042	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let me see if any of the other branches have
chamomile in stock!
COOP81043	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll use the shop's smartphone! If I find any
in stock	 I'll run on over to get them!
COOP81044	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 and our distributor hasn't come today.
If we call them now	 maybe they can make it!
COOP81045	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Could you make the call	 {NAME1}-kun?
COOP81047	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks for waiting! Here you are! One
chamomile bouquet!
COOP81048	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Amazing... You really did it!
COOP81049	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Careful	 it's pretty heavy.
COOP81050	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm afraid it'll be a little expensive	 given
how we got all the flowers...
COOP81051	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh please	 don't worry about that. I'm just
impressed!
COOP81052	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 pshaw! That's what being a florist's all
about!
COOP81053	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Tomoko-san	 {NAME2}-kun	 thank you so much.
I hope to see you again!
COOP81054	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Phew... Thank goodness we made it in time.
COOP81055	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just hope we helped her a little...
COOP81057	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Is that so? Well	 that would please me
greatly.
COOP81058	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah	 you're right. It was nice to see that
smile on her face.
COOP81059	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You really think so? Hehehehe...!
COOP81060	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks for all your help.
COOP81062	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I hope Kotone-san makes up with her coach.
COOP81063	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Our shift's just about over! Let's do our
best by these blooms until then!
COOP81200	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hi	 {NAME1}-kun. Would you happen to be free
today?
COOP81201	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm about to head to a part-time job	 and I
was wondering if you'd like to join me.
COOP81203	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah? Great! Let's go!
COOP81204	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sure	 no worries! Sorry for the last-minute
invitation.
COOP81205	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've been working here a lot on my own
lately.
COOP81206	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thought I should try taking the field without
backup.
COOP81208	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe... Praise feels pretty good!
COOP81209	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I know. Honestly	 having you around makes me
feel a lot more at ease.
COOP81210	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	How would you like the "Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy
Spaghetti"? Today's the last day for this
limited-time special!
COOP81211	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Now that I think about it	 this is your first
time on this job	 right	 {NAME1}-kun?
COOP81212	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That makes me the senior staff today!
COOP81213	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Just ask your ol' senpai here if you need
anything!
COOP81214	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Just kidding. It'd be so embarrassing to say
that and then end up needing your help.
COOP81215	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner Staff	Thanks for coming	 Tomoko-chan!
COOP81216	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	Sorry we're always calling you for the busy
shifts.
COOP81217	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No	 not at all! Glad to be of help!
COOP81218	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	I guess that makes you her little helper for
the day. Pleased to meet you!
COOP81219	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	Working together with your buddy... Ain't
youth grand!
COOP81220	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	Anyhow	 I'm going on break. I leave the floor
to you!
COOP81221	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's give it 110%!
COOP81223	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	All right	 you two	 you're all done.
COOP81224	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It was great working with you! Thanks for
today.
COOP81225	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	Thank you for helping out. See you next time!
COOP81226	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I can't believe how fast that went by.
COOP81227	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 do you have any plans after this	
{NAME1}-kun?
COOP81228	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We just got paid and all	 so I thought we
could stop somewhere on the way home...
COOP81229	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh! Tomoko-san	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP81230	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Kotone-san!
COOP81231	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	We meet again. Are you two on your way out?
COOP81233	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	On our way home from work actually.
COOP81234	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Is that right? I should have come a bit
sooner.
COOP81235	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We've been working here part-time lately.
We were on the floor until a minute ago.
COOP81236	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Is that right? I would have enjoyed seeing
the pair of you in action.
COOP81237	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 {NAME1}-kun? Our shift's over	 remember?
COOP81238	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	You two worked here today then	 did you? What
a shame. If only I had come earlier.
COOP81239	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I like to come here from time to time. The
pasta is really delicious.
COOP81240	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Have you tried the limited-time special? The
Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy Spaghetti!?
COOP81241	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh yes	 that dish looked quite tasty!
I thought I'd like to try it at least once...
COOP81242	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	But I find myself daunted by the sheer
quantity. It must be very high in calories.
COOP81243	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You're right about that... One plate easily
feeds a table of three.
COOP81244	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! What if we all split it? I wanted to give
it a try too anyway!
COOP81245	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh	 really!? You would?
COOP81246	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What do you think	 {NAME1}-kun? I bet the
three of us could pack it away no problem!
COOP81247	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	But I do feel bad	 making you follow my whims
like this...
COOP81249	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What he said. Plus we wanted to try it too!
If it's all right with you	 that is.
COOP81250	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah! Today's the last day of the special. If
we don't eat it now	 we'll "rigate" it later!
COOP81251	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	See? {NAME1}-kun's starving. We're up for it
if you are	 Kotone-san!
COOP81252	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	If you insist	 well... By all means	 lead
the way.
COOP81253	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	Here you go! One Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy
Spaghetti	 made to order!
COOP81254	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	It looks divine! And there's so much of it...
COOP81255	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ner St<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ff	The three of you are sharing	 right? We
added a little extra for you.
COOP81256	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks so much	 Senpai!
COOP81258	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh yeah	 how did things go with your coach?
Were you able to make up?
COOP81259	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Ah	 the bouquet brouhaha. I'm so grateful for
your help with that.
COOP81260	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I'm pleased to say coach beamed at the sight
of it. She even joked	 "I wonder how much tea
this'll make."
COOP81261	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	We were back on good terms in no time. And I
have you to thank for it.
COOP81262	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	And for the pasta as well! I would have
missed the opportunity to try it without you.
COOP81263	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	{NAME1}-kun and I had been looking for a way
to help you.
COOP81264	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We're just glad we could be of some support!
COOP81265	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's really good to see you happy	
Kotone-san.
COOP81266	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Support...?
COOP81267	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 not that you need support or anything!
I mean	 it was just me being nosy! I mean‚Äî!
COOP81268	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	When I said I wanted to help	 I didn't mean
you did anything to make me think you need‚Äî!
Um	 please don't worry about this!
COOP81269	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	No	 it's not that! I'm sorry	 please don't
misunderstand!
COOP81270	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	It makes me so happy that you two would be so
considerate of me this way. Truly.
COOP81271	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	It's just	 um...
COOP81272	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Is rehab not going as well as it should?
COOP81273	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I'm sorry.
COOP81274	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	How can I say this... Recently I feel like
I'm being driven into a corner.
COOP81275	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh no... That's... I mean	 that sounds so...
COOP81276	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	{NAME1}-kun?
COOP81278	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah... I think he's right.
COOP81279	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Extended rehab can really take a toll on you
mentally. Trust me	 I know.
COOP81280	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Thank you...
COOP81281	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Me? Um	 well...
COOP81282	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wha‚Äî!? {NAME1}-kun!? You can't just ask that
out of nowhere!
COOP81283	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Fine by me. Shall we exchange details as
well	 Tomoko-chan?
COOP81284	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really!?
COOP81285	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	You've been such a good friend to me. I trust
you won't spread it around	 yes?
COOP81286	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um! If you ever have the time	 Kotone-san	
would you want to hang out maybe!?
COOP81287	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	It would be my pleasure.
COOP81288	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really!?
COOP81289	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I have more than enough free time. And I
would like the chance to repay your kindness.
So by all means	 I'd love to.
COOP81291	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I can't wait to hang out with Kotone-san! I'd
better start thinking of places for us to go
together.
COOP81292	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You really helped me out today in a big way.
COOP81293	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thank you again	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP81400	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 {NAME1}-kun! Are you free?
COOP81401	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I thought I'd try to invite Kotone-san to
hang out... Think you could join us?
COOP81403	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Great! The three of us can go to Odaiba!
COOP81404	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okey-doke. I'll let Kotone-san know that
we'll reschedule.
COOP81405	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is the first time we're hanging out
outside of work. Kind of weird	 huh	
{NAME1}-kun?
COOP81406	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP81408	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe... Yeah	 you're right.
COOP81409	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes! I remember all of the days we've spent
together	 and they were all work!
COOP81410	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right!? What a lovely day!
COOP81411	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Perfect for going out. I'm glad we got to
meet up on a day like this.
COOP81412	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You know	 ever since that time at the diner	
Kotone-san and I have been messaging a lot.
COOP81413	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She told me all about herself. Her family	
what shops she goes to	 even her favorite
bakery!
COOP81414	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	After talking to her	 I realized she's really
a totally normal person!
COOP81415	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still... She hasn't said anything about her
rehab. And I'm not even sure how to ask.
COOP81416	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh. {NAME1}-kun	 over there. I think
that's her...
COOP81417	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh	 you're here!
COOP81418	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes! Um	 you weren't waiting too long	
were you...?
COOP81419	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Not at all. I just arrived myself. I had
something on my mind is all.
COOP81420	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Would you two be in the mood for a meal by
any chance? My treat! As thanks for that
pasta.
COOP81422	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Are you sure you don't mind?
COOP81423	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right	 we can't accept! I'd feel bad...
COOP81424	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wha‚Äî!? No	 {NAME1}-kun! You have to reject
the offer with grace!
COOP81425	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Did you two let me off the hook that easily
when I tried to decline your pasta proposal?
COOP81426	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I want to foot the bill	 so please	 don't
stand on ceremony. Let's have fun.
COOP81429	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh boy	 look at the time. Sorry for keeping
you out so late!
COOP81430	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Not at all. I left the entire day open for
this. My docket for tomorrow is mostly empty
as well.
COOP81431	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I couldn't have asked for a better diversion.
I feel so much lighter now.
COOP81432	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let us know when you're in the mood for
another one! I'll rush right over.
COOP81433	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	And	 um	 if you ever need to talk about
anything	 you can talk to me... Okay?
COOP81434	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I have so many people who've supported me
through my injury. {NAME1}-kun	 friends	
family. So if I can be there for you...
COOP81435	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I can't go back to my dream anymore	 but if
there's any way I can help you return to
yours	 I...!
COOP81436	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP81437	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway	 um	 yeah...! I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be nosing into your business...
COOP81438	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	No	 not in the least.
COOP81439	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I've just been thinking of myself... When in
truth	 you have it so much worse than I do.
COOP81440	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I could make my return at any time	
and yet...
COOP81441	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You shouldn't rush into anything	 Kotone-san!
Your fans will understand!
COOP81442	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	People all around the world are waiting
patiently for you to grace the rink again!
COOP81443	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	......
COOP81444	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Yes... They are.
COOP81445	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I know rehab is really hard when you're going
through it	 but it'll be over before you‚Äî
COOP81446	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Kotone-san!? What's wrong!?
COOP81447	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Forgive me. It isn't what you think...
COOP81448	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	My injury... already healed. I finished rehab
a long time ago...
COOP81449	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huh!?
COOP81451	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If you're all better	 then why...?
COOP81452	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I had already completed my rehabilitation by
the time we met.
COOP81453	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I wanted to return to the ice. Truly I did.
It's just... I couldn't.
COOP81454	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	The moment I put skate to ice	 my legs start
to shake... and my mind goes white...
COOP81455	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh no. But... why?
COOP81456	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	In the past	 I would see these awful comments
about me online in the time leading up to
competitions...
COOP81457	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	They didn't faze me at first. It's
commonplace in the figure skating world.
COOP81458	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	But they stuck somewhere	 in some dark corner
of my heart. Then during rehab	 they started
getting to me.
COOP81459	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Did anyone truly want me to succeed in the
first place?
COOP81460	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Were more people hoping to see me go through
pain and suffering in rehabilitation?
COOP81461	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No	 that's not‚Äî!
COOP81462	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I know it isn't true... In my mind	 I know.
The problem is my heart.
COOP81463	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	That's why being around the two of you
relaxes me so. You're just so sincere...
COOP81464	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	You've inspired me to face this.
COOP81465	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Thank you for today. Truly. I hope we can do
this again sometime.
COOP81467	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 {NAME1}-kun. Are you doing anything
today?
COOP81468	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've just got to do something for Kotone-san.
I can't leave her like this.
COOP81469	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes	 I know it's none of my business. And I
know it won't be easy.
COOP81470	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But if I do nothing and then she quits figure
skating for good	 well...
COOP81471	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just feel like I'll be stuck forever too.
COOP81472	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Like my heart will go back to the moment I
found out I'd never play baseball again.
COOP81473	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I need your help. Or	 really... I just need
you by my side.
COOP81474	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I feel like I can face anything when you're
with me	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP81475	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Please...
COOP81477	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm so grateful	 {NAME1}-kun. Really...
COOP81479	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ever since our first shift together	 you've
always been there for me.
COOP81480	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP81481	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I feel like I've come so far in my recovery
thanks to you.
COOP81482	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I know I can't be dependent on you forever.
I know that. It's just...
COOP81483	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sometimes... Sometimes I think it would be
nice if we could stay together like this.
COOP81485	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thank you	 {NAME1}-kun. For everything.
Please	 stay with me... just a bit longer.
COOP81487	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You're so kind	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP81488	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll try my hardest!
COOP81489	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I think I'll stop by a restaurant on the way
home. Now	 diner or burger shop? Decisions	
decisions.
COOP81491	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe... If you talk like that	 I'll never
stop relying on you	 you know?
COOP81493	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huh? Wait	 you don't mean...
COOP81494	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	......
COOP81495	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huh?
COOP81496	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wait	 am I dreaming? When did I go to sleep?
Wait	 what?
COOP81497	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	*gasp*
COOP81498	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 {NAME1}-kun! I feel the same way!
COOP81499	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've felt this way about you for the longest
time! Really	 I have!
COOP81500	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This isn't a dream	 right? If I'm going to
wake up	 now's the time...
COOP81501	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just don't know anymore...
COOP81502	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Even if this is a dream... I'd be happy
staying like this forever.
COOP81505	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Stay with me	 {NAME1}-kun...
COOP81508	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thank you	 {NAME1}-kun. For everything.
Please	 stay with me... just a bit longer.
COOP81600	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okey-dokey then. Let's have that talk next
time you're free.
COOP81601	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Also	 I wanted to talk to you about the whole
situation with Kotone-san...
COOP81603	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? In that case...
COOP81604	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's head to the job first. Today we're
working at a bookstore in Shinjuku. Let's
give it our all!
COOP81605	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okey-dokey then. Let's have that talk next
time you're free.
COOP81606	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	100 Brass Band Classics? Whoa.
COOP81607	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Musicians are so cool. I couldn't read sheet
music if my life depended on it.
COOP81608	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I have a few friends in the brass band at
school. Ah... But that's not what I wanted to talk to
you about.
COOP81610	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	......
COOP81611	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah... I know.
COOP81612	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I read up on Kotone-san on the internet.
COOP81613	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Apparently she's been an incredibly
hard-working figure skater since childhood.
COOP81614	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then she went on to win a bunch of
competitions...
COOP81615	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That was probably around the time I first
heard about her.
COOP81616	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Have you heard the name "Ice Queen" before?
That's what people started calling her.
COOP81617	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Her beauty had something to do with it	
of course	 but...
COOP81618	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Around then people started trashing her
online. For dumb reasons like	 "she seems
cold	 she doesn't smile enough."
COOP81619	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It made me sick reading the things they said.
The kind of abuses they slung at her...
COOP81620	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anonymous comments like that are wallpapered
all over the internet.
COOP81621	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	People who wrote some of the more extreme
comments were even convicted in criminal
court.
COOP81622	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still	 a verdict can't fix the damage done to
Kotone-san's heart.
COOP81624	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right!? Just thinking there are people like
that out there makes me so mad!
COOP81625	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe a little	 but not enough.
COOP81626	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You don't have to look very far to find it.
But I am a sleuth with a search engine.
COOP81627	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's strong enough to face the pressure of a
worldwide tournament without batting an eye	
and yet she gets treated so horribly.
COOP81628	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just keep thinking	 isn't there anything
I can do about this?
COOP81629	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I can't say for sure just how much this has
affected Kotone-san...
COOP81630	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...but I can imagine.
COOP81631	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Remember how I said I'm really bad with away
games?
COOP81632	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Just me in the batter's box	 with the
opposing team in front of me...
COOP81633	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	And all I can hear is the cheering of
their fans...
COOP81634	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No one there to cheer me on...
COOP81635	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Everyone on Earth waiting for me to
strike out.
COOP81636	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I knew that wasn't actually true... But in
that moment	 it was.
COOP81637	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Even though my teammates were there on the
bench. Even though there were people in the
stands who came to support me.
COOP81638	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Heck	 when Motoha came to watch me in middle
school...
COOP81639	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...you could hear her cheering from the
outfield bleachers.
COOP81640	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But I couldn't hear their support when the
opponent's cheers drowned them out.
COOP81641	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Somehow	 I want to make sure Kotone-san hears
all of the people rooting for her out there.
COOP81642	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm sure that's all she needs. As long as she
has that	 it'll all work out...
COOP81643	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still	 it's the "how" I'm drawing a blank on.
Any ideas	 {NAME_COOP_8}-kun?
COOP81646	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We'd get teammates on the bench to shout.
COOP81647	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	As for the fans... Get them to shout even
louder?
COOP81648	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But all I know is baseball...
COOP81649	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe	 you see that in amateur league ball
sometimes.
COOP81650	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Most arenas don't allow you to bring amps
and stuff.
COOP81651	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've never seen one at a figure skating
competition anyway.
COOP81652	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Since high school	 we've had the brass band
cheering us on.
COOP81653	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They really put their backs into it	 our
school band. Each batter gets their own
cheer song.
COOP81654	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No matter how loud the opposing team gets	
there's no way they can drown out those
tunes.
COOP81655	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Friends in the stands would cheer too. All of
them with their megaphones going...
COOP81656	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's go, To-mo-ko! "Let's go	 To-mo-ko!"
COOP81657	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Because of all that	 I never felt that
anxiety at games anymore...
COOP81658	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That's it...
COOP81659	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	A cheer song! By a brass band! Something like
that is sure to reach her!
COOP81660	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She'll have to know we're there for her!
We'll prepare a cheer song just for
Kotone-san!
COOP81661	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll talk to my brass band buddies! Then
we'll get the pep up planning powwow
underway!
COOP81662	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I mean‚Äî! After work	 of course!
COOP81665	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 {NAME1}-kun? I kind of have a favor to
ask you...
COOP81666	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	{NAME2}-kun. Do you still have time
right now?
COOP81667	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I want to confirm a few more details before I
pull the trigger on Kotone-san's cheer song.
COOP81668	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So... Do you think you can stick around for a
little while longer?
COOP81669	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I know I'm being childish and acting like a
big buttinski here	 but...
COOP81670	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just have to see this through.
COOP81672	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay. I'm sure this'll go off without a hitch
if you're there with me	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP81673	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay. I'm sure this'll go off without a hitch
if you're there with me	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP81674	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks	 but I'm not	 I swear. I just have to
make this happen.
COOP81675	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks for all your help!
COOP81676	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Now	 to the pep up planning powwow! It's at
the diner by the way. My treat!
COOP81678	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Now then	 where to hold our pep-up planning
powwow... Where do you feel like	
{NAME2}-kun?
COOP81700	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh hey	 perfect timing	 {NAME_COOP_8}-kun.
I wanted to talk to you about Kotone-san's
cheer song.
COOP81701	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I thought we'd try to pull it off today. What
do you think? Can you make it?
COOP81703	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay! So here's the plan.
COOP81704	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	{NAME_COOP_8}-kun	 you'll invite Kotone-san to
school. Anything should work	 just make it
sound natural.
COOP81705	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll meet up with the brass band club in the
meantime	 then we'll come meet you when we're
ready.
COOP81706	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then we'll come meet you when we're ready.
COOP81707	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then once Kotone-san arrives at school	
we'll take her to the roof	 and start the
performance.
COOP81708	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll be counting on you	 {NAME_COOP_8}-kun!
COOP81709	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I see... Well	 I want you to be there when
it happens	 {NAME_COOP_8}-kun. Let me know next
time you're free!
COOP81710	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let me know next time you're free!
COOP81711	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The brass band's primed and ready! All that's
left is for Kotone-san to show up.
COOP81712	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She should be here any second...
COOP81713	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Tomoko-san! {NAME2}-kun!
COOP81714	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Kotone-san!
COOP81715	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I wanted to see you two	 so I came as quickly
as I could. Why did you want to meet here?
COOP81716	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP81717	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well	 we've got a surprise for you.
COOP81718	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Surprise? Here at the school? I wonder what
it is.
COOP81720	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Hehe	 fair enough.
COOP81721	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So	 um... Follow us	 okay? This way!
COOP81722	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	What a lovely school this is.
COOP81723	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Isn't it about time you let me in on this
surprise?
COOP81724	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Do you hear something	 Kotone-san?
COOP81725	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I hear students... practicing for a concert	
from the sound of it.
COOP81726	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That's our school's brass band. You know	
trumpets	 trombones	 stuff like that.
COOP81727	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Back in my baseball days	 they'd play at the
stadium to cheer on our team.
COOP81728	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This isn't the full band	 but it gives you an
idea of what a cheer song sounds like.
COOP81729	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Oh yes	 you can hear much the same at
Koshien.
COOP81730	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Even at away games	 when cheers for the
opposing team were really loud	 I'd hear them
playing and I'd know...
COOP81731	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	My friends are here.
COOP81732	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I envy you	 I admit. Figure skaters are all
alone during their routines.
COOP81733	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes... I can't say I know the feeling. That's
why I wanted you to hear this	 Kotone-san.
COOP81734	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I told my friends in the brass band that
there's someone I had to give a cheer no
matter what.
COOP81735	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP81736	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	And a bunch of them said yes right away!
COOP81737	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Huh?
COOP81738	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	All right	 everyone! Take it away!
COOP81739	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>eering Voice	Hey	 hey	 Ko-to-ne! Hit them with that slide
chasse!
COOP81740	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Huuuuuh!?
COOP81741	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They're all your fans. You should've heard
them grill me about how I knew you.
COOP81742	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I didn't tell them the details	 but knowing
it was for you was more then enough to
convince‚Äî
COOP81743	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um... Kotone-san?
COOP81744	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	......
COOP81746	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	So	 that surprise...
COOP81747	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	This song... You planned this for me?
COOP81748	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 yes. It's a riff on the song they'd do
for me at bat. Obviously the old version was
a bit diff‚Äî
COOP81749	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah	 that makes it sound like some sort of
shoddy hand-me-down	 doesn't it? Sorry...
COOP81750	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP81751	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	No	 not in the least.
COOP81752	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I'll add this song to my program at the next
competition.
COOP81753	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Your	 uh	 program?
COOP81754	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I'll skate to this.
COOP81755	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huuuuuuuuuh!?
COOP81756	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wait	 you're skating in the tournament!?
You mean‚Äî!?
COOP81757	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	There is no way I could miss this.
COOP81758	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	No matter what words are thrown my way	 this
song will reach me.
COOP81759	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	With this	 I can get back in the rink. I know
it. I'm ready now.
COOP81760	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Would it be all right if I stepped out to
call my coach for a minute? Then I'd like to
meet those brass band friends of yours.
COOP81761	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I must thank you two somehow as well...
My	 so much to do!
COOP81763	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah	 you should start there. The place you
wanted to go back most.
COOP81764	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Good idea. If you got hurt in all the
excitement	 I'd never forgive myself.
COOP81765	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe. The brass band said the same thing. And
they want a picture together.
COOP81766	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still	 we can do that later.
COOP81767	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Go on! I bet you're itching to strap on those
skates	 right?
COOP81768	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Thank you...!
COOP81769	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Tomoko-san! {NAME2}-kun!
COOP81770	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Would you two become my emotional support
coaches!? I'm absolutely serious!
COOP81771	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Mission successful. Thank goodness!
COOP81772	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really...
COOP81773	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	After I quit baseball... I was full of dread.
COOP81774	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	All I had was the game. I had no idea what I
was supposed to do with my life without it.
COOP81775	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But for the first time since then	 I finally
thought...
COOP81776	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm glad I had baseball in my life.
COOP81777	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That was kind of heavy	 huh?
COOP81778	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	When you're with me	 all of these feelings
just kind of bubble up	 {NAME2}-kun.
COOP81779	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I guess I let my guard down around you. It's
a little embarrassing to be honest.
COOP81780	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But I feel like I've finally discovered what
I can offer this world as I am now.
COOP81781	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Or really	 because of who I am now.
COOP81782	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thank you again	 {NAME_COOP_8}-kun.
COOP81784	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So. Would you still come with me to my next
part-time job?
COOP81785	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	When I'm with you	 {NAME_COOP_8}-kun	 I feel like
my next dream is right
around the corner.
COOP81786	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I feel like my next dream is right around the
corner.
COOP81788	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks! Here's to more great shifts together!
COOP81789	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	As long as we're together	 we can get through
anything.
COOP81790	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah! We'll knock it out of the park!
COOP81791	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's keep doing our best tomorrow! Fight on!
COOP83000	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun...
COOP83001	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um...!
COOP83002	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Are you free today? I kind of have a favor
to ask...
COOP83004	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Well	 um	 in that case...
COOP83005	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So	 it's um... It's a little childish
actually. I'm kind of embarrassed to ask.
COOP83006	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I see... That's fine. Um	 sorry for asking so
out of the blue.
COOP83007	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The thing is	 um	 I'd like to get a part-time
job. Now that I've quit baseball and all.
COOP83008	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	And I actually found a job that seems pretty
nice! It's at a cr√™pe shop in Shibuya.
COOP83009	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So... I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
coming with me to check it out?
COOP83011	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh... Are you worried about me working with
my arm?
COOP83012	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well... To be completely frank	 I am. Not to
mention my arm's kind of...
COOP83013	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah. I'm totally fine now.
COOP83014	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They said it won't heal any further than
this. But it doesn't hurt	 or interfere with
my daily life at all.
COOP83015	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	At this point	 it's all down to whether
I feel ready or not. So	 um	 that's why
I thought...
COOP83016	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...if you came with me	 {NAME1}-kun	
I should be able to handle it. Probably.
COOP83017	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? You will!? Thank you so much! Okay	
I'll be ready in two seconds!
COOP83018	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Ah	 I am so glad you two showed up. Our usual
part-timers canceled at the last minute.
COOP83019	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sorry about this... It looks like they got
the wrong idea when you showed up with me...
COOP83021	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sorry	 thanks. I really appreciate it.
COOP83022	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehehe... I suppose I do. I'll pay you back
for sure	 just you wait!
COOP83023	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hearing you say that makes me feel much
better... Thank you.
COOP83024	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Okay	 you kids're on cr√™pe duty. Wrapping's
a cinch	 and cooking's not too hard either
once you're used to it.
COOP83025	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP83026	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wait... It sounds like you're leaving us to
figure out the whole kit and caboodle by
ourselves.
COOP83027	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Thing is	 I'm not really good with teaching	
sooo... Look	 there's a manual for everything
over there.
COOP83028	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Otherwise you can look up tutorials online	
'kay? Knock yourselves out.
COOP83029	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Welp	 g'luck kids. Byeee!
COOP83030	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Seriously? They're just throwing us to the
wolves? Okay	 um	 where's that manual...?
COOP83031	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's see... So first there's different
flavor bases... Cream... Matcha...
COOP83032	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The recipes are pretty straightforward... For
Choco Banana Cream	 put chocolate sauce on a
cream base	 et cetera.
COOP83033	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	As for cooking the batter itself	 I've seen a
bunch of videos on the subject already.
COOP83035	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well	 no way out but through! Ready to tackle
the wild world of cr√™pe making	
{NAME1}-kun!?
COOP83037	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	T-There...!
COOP83038	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Ohhh	 now those're some good-lookin' cr√™pes.
You kids are naturals.
COOP83039	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	A good thin layer	 with a nice tight roll.
This can't be your first rodeo.
COOP83040	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 no. We just followed the manual and
whatnot.
COOP83041	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It was always my dream to run a cr√™perie when
I was a little girl.
COOP83042	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Huh	 you don't say?
COOP83043	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I guess dreams really do come true!
COOP83044	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huh?
COOP83045	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Yes	 you're right! They really do!
COOP83046	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Looks like I can leave everything in your
capable hands after all. Have at it	 kids!
COOP83047	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah	 yes	 you can count on us! Ahahaha...
COOP83049	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've wanted to do this since way before I
ever started baseball.
COOP83050	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Consider this a dream fulfilled!
COOP83051	F<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ashy Customer	Excuse me	 can we order?
COOP83052	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes	 one moment	 please! Um	 do you think you
could help some more	 {NAME1}-kun?
COOP83054	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Great work today	 kids. We got way more
customers than usual.
COOP83055	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	I put a little extra in your pay for today.
You've earned it.
COOP83056	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Whew... That was way more tiring than I
thought it would be.
COOP83057	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But look! I finished my first part-time job!
COOP83058	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You were a huge help today! Thanks for coming
with me on such short notice.
COOP83059	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't think it would've gone so smoothly
without your help	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP83060	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If I keep this up	 I think things should
work out!
COOP83062	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe! Thank you!
COOP83063	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well	 I am still a newbie and all... This
feels like just the bottom of the first
inning.
COOP83064	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 believe me	 I'm aiming for the bleachers!
Ahahaha!
COOP83065	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You know	 I always struggled with playing
away games.
COOP83066	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Knowing somebody's supporting me in the
stands really puts me at ease. It's kind of
childish I guess.
COOP83067	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 um	 {NAME1}-kun?
COOP83068	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If it's all right with you	 could we work
together again sometime?
COOP83069	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	When you have the time	 of course! Totally
understand if you can't. So	 uh...?
COOP83071	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? You mean it!? Yaaay! That's great!
COOP83074	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	All right! On to the next gig!
COOP83075	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Fight on!
COOP83100	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun!
COOP83101	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Do you remember those part-time jobs we were
talking about? I found one I'd like to try.
COOP83102	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So I thought	 well... if you're free	 we
could do it together?
COOP83104	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Really? Then let's go! This time it's a
beef bowl place in Shibuya.
COOP83105	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh... Well	 that's all right. Sorry to spring
this on you.
COOP83106	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've never stood on this side before. It's so
high up! And a little nerve-racking.
COOP83107	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Looking forward to working with you	
{NAME1}-kun!
COOP83108	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	By the way... About what the boss was
saying...
COOP83109	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Apparently some customers have been causing
them trouble lately. Stuff like spiking the
water pitchers with spice...
COOP83110	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Uploading pictures of leftover beef bowls
they've tossed onto the floor...
COOP83111	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The boss seems very upset about it. He says 
they're acting like Menaces.
COOP83112	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Think there's anything we could do to help?
I'm sure it's easier said than done	 but...
COOP83114	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah! I was hoping you'd say that!
COOP83115	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The police... They need evidence before they
can do anything. Just like with my incident.
COOP83116	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sounds like they keep their backs to the
cameras or stay in the blind spots.
COOP83117	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe if we see any suspicious behavior...
we could go for a pickoff? That should
work...
COOP83118	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oops	 baseball speak. A pickoff is when the
pitcher and first baseman tag out a runner
who's trying to steal second!
COOP83119	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh. But I guess there are no pitchers here
but the water kind	 eh!?
COOP83120	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay	 let's get this beef bowl bonanza
started! Fight on!
COOP83121	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 welcome! Please take a seat wherever
you like!
COOP83123	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Psst	 hey	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP83124	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That customer over there. Does he look a bit
suspicious to you?
COOP83126	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Do you think he's one of those troublemakers
the boss was talking about?
COOP83128	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's keep an eye on them. Just in case.
COOP83129	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well	 it looks like we're running low on
water. Maybe they're just trying to flag down
some staff?
COOP83130	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I was a catcher after all. Gotta keep an eye
on the entire field.
COOP83131	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	No one's eager to steal a base if they think
someone's watching them.
COOP83132	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll go bring over a fresh pitcher of water.
Could you keep watch	 {NAME1}-kun?
COOP83134	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Pardon me! More water to keep our fine
customers hydrated!
COOP83135	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thank you! Have a nice day!
COOP83136	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah	 that was sketchy with a capital S.
Think he was up to something?
COOP83137	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah! {NAME1}-kun! Over there! Crime in
progress!
COOP83139	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll go tell the boss! And the police!
COOP83140	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Customer	Hey! What's your problem	 asshole!?
COOP83141	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The police are on their way! There he is	
Boss! That guy!
COOP83142	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oublesome Customer	What!? I dunno nothin' about nothin'!
Lemme go!
COOP83143	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You took a video of that	 didn't you!? Heck	
you're still recordin'!
COOP83144	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Don't let him delete it! Put the phone over
there and don't let him touch it!
COOP83146	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The boss is thrilled! We caught the perp	
and kept collateral damage to a minimum.
COOP83147	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	He said sales were good today too. Foot
traffic is up from the sound of it.
COOP83148	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Which means a fat paycheck for us! Woohoo!
COOP83149	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's been a while since I got to put my
fielding skills to good use. It felt pretty
nice.
COOP83151	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ehehe	 thanks!
COOP83152	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You know! Surveying the field and all that!
Thwarting the stolen base attempt...?
COOP83153	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right? I slugged that pitcher like a pro!
Wait	 you know that's not what pitching
actually is though	 right?
COOP83154	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway... I wouldn't have been able to do a
thing if I were here by myself.
COOP83155	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It'd be nice to work together again sometime.
Ah	 I mean	 if you want to	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP83156	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks for today!
COOP83200	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hi	 {NAME1}-kun. Would you happen to be
free today?
COOP83201	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've got another part-time job in mind. Do
you think you could come with me maybe?
COOP83203	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really? Great! This job's at a convenience
store in Shibuya.
COOP83204	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I hear there are lots of things to do	 so
it'll be busy... But I think we'll make it
work!
COOP83205	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah	 I see. Maybe I'll take it on another
time then.
COOP83206	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer Wearing a Suit	I'd like to ship this golf bag. Oh	 and I'd
like to pay my water bill.
COOP83207	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes	 sir! Let's see... That'll be 4	400 yen.
COOP83208	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thank you very much!
COOP83209	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Phew... Finally	 a bit of a lull.
COOP83210	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is even harder than they made it sound!
There's a ton to do	 and a constant stream of
customers.
COOP83211	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If you weren't here	 {NAME1}-kun	 I'd just
be freaking out behind the register.
COOP83212	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I think I'm getting the hang of this though.
One step at a time	 right?
COOP83213	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's keep it up through to the end of our
shifts!
COOP83214	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Welcome!
COOP83215	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer	Tomoko-chan? Is that you?
COOP83216	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Yeah	 it's me. Hello!
COOP83217	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is my neighbor.
COOP83218	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer	Who'd have thought we'd meet here of all
places! I didn't know you had a part-time
job.
COOP83219	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's a recent thing	 I've got time to spare
these days. Oh	 do you need a bag?
COOP83220	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer	Yes	 please. And yes... That must have been
pretty tough on you	 huh?
COOP83221	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer	I heard about your shoulder from your mother.
Such a shame. You were aiming for the pros
too	 weren't you?
COOP83222	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um... Yeah	 well	 you know...
COOP83223	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer	It was that	 what was he called	 Subway
Slammer? One of those "Menaces	 right?
COOP83224,M<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer,Some people said it was an accident, but
given the circumstances, I have to think
that's what happened. You poor thing.
COOP83225,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,......
COOP83227,M<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer,Whoops, sorry! Look at me gabbing away!
COOP83228,M<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Customer,Have a good shift, Tomoko-chan! I'll be
cheering you on!
COOP83229,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Uh, yes. Thanks a lot.
COOP83230,Si<#000000,l,#FFFFFF>ver-Haired Girl,Uh...
COOP83231,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Huh?
COOP83233,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Huh? Ah! Sorry, sorry! Welcome!
COOP83234,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Oh, um. No, I'm fine... Ah, welcome!
COOP83235,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,W-Welcome!?
COOP83236,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,That'll be 181 yen! Do you need a bag?
COOP83237,S<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl,......
COOP83238,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Uh...
COOP83239,S<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl,No... I'll take it as-is.
COOP83240,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,H-Have a nice day.
COOP83241,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I think I might've upset her...
COOP83242,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Wait... Was that...?
COOP83244,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,No, not exactly.
COOP83245,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Oh, yes, I'm fine. That interaction didn't
bother me or anything.
COOP83246,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Huh? Oh, uh... Sure. She was beautiful, no
doubt.
COOP83247,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,But I swear I've seen her somewhere before...
COOP83248,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Oh, welcome!
COOP83252,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Ahhh, it finally ended...
COOP83253,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,You helped me so much today... Sorry for
being such a burden.
COOP83255,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I've always been bad with that sort of thing.
I make one fielding error, and I just can't
get back on track.
COOP83256,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Motoha and I were battery mates since
elementary school, and she was always
covering for me.
COOP83257,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I've been doing my best to function on my own
ever since she quit, but...
COOP83258,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Before I know it, I'm right back where I
started.
COOP83260,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Thanks. I'll do my best!
COOP83261,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Thanks, {NAME1}-kun.
COOP83262,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,You're right. I'll try to be a little easier
on myself.
COOP83263,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Hehe! With you backing me up, I bet I'll be
back on the horse in no time.
COOP83265,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Right. Enough being a gloomy Gus!
COOP83266,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,We finished our shift no problem! And we've
got the pay to prove it!
COOP83267,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Really, {NAME1}-kun, thanks so much for
today. Let me know next time you're free,
okay?
COOP83300,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Oh, hey, {NAME1}-kun! How's your day
looking?
COOP83301,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,A shop I frequent is looking for some extra
help, sooo, I was thinking that, uh, maybe
we could...
COOP83302,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP83304,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Have you been to the drugstore in Shibuya?
That's where we'll be working today!
COOP83305,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Ah... It's okay. Uh, sorry to bother you.
COOP83306,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Oh wow, this takes me back. I haven't been
here in forever.
COOP83308,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I came here all the time during my baseball
days. Working here is a first though.
COOP83309,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,They sell a lot of good stuff here. Sports
tape, cooling sprays, the works.
COOP83310,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,I used to stop by here all the time after
practice. Even the staff knew me.
COOP83311,Store M<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>nager,Hey, Tomoko-chan! Welcome, welcome!
COOP83312,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Good to see you again! Oh, I guess I should
call you Boss" starting today.
COOP83313	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Ahaha	 I suppose you're right. So	 how's your
injury doing?
COOP83314	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 it's fine now! It doesn't even hurt
anymore!
COOP83315	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	Good to hear. Lots of stuff to lift and move
around at this job	 so don't push yourself	
okay?
COOP83316	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes	 thank you!
COOP83317	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right	 then! Let's do it to it!
COOP83318	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmmm...
COOP83319	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Something I always used to think when I came
to this store as a customer...
COOP83320	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...was that they really ought to put all of
the foodstuffs closer to the entrance.
COOP83321	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	There are plenty of students like me that
roll through here on their way home from
school.
COOP83322	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They're all exhausted and hungry after club.
I'm sure they'd want a cheap	 easy snack to
fill themselves up.
COOP83323	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Look at me acting like I own the place...
I can't just rearrange things however I like.
COOP83325	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	True. No harm in asking	 right?
COOP83326	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Fair point. There's a reason he put
everything where it is now. I'd better give
it a think.
COOP83327	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks for saying so. At the very least	
I'd better ask for the manager's permission
first.
COOP83328	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Welcome!
COOP83329	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl	Um... Do you happen to sell cooling spray?
COOP83330	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes	 you can find it in the aisle over‚Äî
COOP83331	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl	Oh	 don't you work at the convenience store?
Him too...
COOP83332	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 yeah! You came by the other day	
didn't you?
COOP83333	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl	So	 you work here as well.
COOP83334	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yes. Well	 part-time	 anyway.
COOP83335	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um... Have we met somewhere before?
COOP83336	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl	What? We met at the store...
COOP83337	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I mean yes	 but before that	 I could have
sworn... Hmmm...
COOP83338	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! You're that figure skater!
COOP83339	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl	Um	 please don't say that so loudly... I'm
trying to keep a low profile...
COOP83340	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah	 sorry! I just got a little excited.
COOP83341	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Um	 your name is Kotone	 right? <color=#FF423F>Kotone
Montagne</color>?
COOP83342	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	How nice of you to remember. Not many still
do so long after my injury.
COOP83343	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>lver-Haired Girl	Error: tnxotb-[COOP83343]
COOP83345	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I guess you don't follow sports news	
{NAME1}-kun?
COOP83346	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's an amazing figure skater. Multiple
world championship winner amazing.
COOP83347	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You bet! I've only seen her in videos	 but
plenty of people I know are fans too.
COOP83348	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I have friends who've bought tickets to see
her in person. Her routines are always
gorgeous!
COOP83349	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What!? You don't know who she is!? That's a
world-class figure skater standing in front
of you!
COOP83350	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's won all sorts of competitions. And
she's on the news ALL the time.
COOP83351	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Well	 I haven't been doing much of anything
since I got injured before the last
competition...
COOP83352	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I was quite surprised when I heard about you.
Another bird with broken wings so close by.
COOP83353	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	It's difficult	 isn't it? I'd want to get
back to my sport as soon as possible	 if only
I could.
COOP83354	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah... You're not wrong about that.
COOP83355	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 but	 I'm actually doing fine now. My
rehab's been over for a while!
COOP83356	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	And I've got people cheering me on everyday
too. Like {NAME1}-kun here!
COOP83358	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Hehe	 the pleasure is mine. You two must be
quite close to work jobs together like this.
COOP83359	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ah	 um	 I guess we are!
COOP83360	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway! Has it been decided when you'll make
your big comeback?
COOP83361	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Well... I'm sorry	 I'm afraid it's still up
in the air...
COOP83362	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 no	 I'm sorry! It was insensitive of me
to ask...
COOP83363	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I managed to finish up my rehab	 but it was a
really hard	 painful process.
COOP83364	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	You're right	 it's really quite...
COOP83365	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 but the rehab I went through must be
nothing like what you have to do to get back
in the rink	 right?
COOP83366	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm sorry	 I didn't mean to act like I know
exactly what you're going through when I
couldn't possibly...
COOP83367	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You wanted cooling spray	 right!?
COOP83368	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We have it in that aisle over there	 kind of
tucked away. Here	 let me show you.
COOP83369	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Thank you.
COOP83370	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Tomoko Noge-san	 right? And
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
COOP83371	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Thank you for all of your help. I appreciate
it.
COOP83372	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Please come again! This shop's got the best
selection around.
COOP83373	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Yes	 I will. Do you two work here often?
COOP83374	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Work often	 yes. Here	 not always... But we
work in a lot of shops around Shibuya
Station.
COOP83375	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But we work in a lot of shops around Shibuya
Station.
COOP83376	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	I come around here quite a bit. Perhaps we'll
meet again.
COOP83377	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really!? Yes! I'd love that!
COOP83378	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Mon<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>agne	Wonderful. Well	 until then.
COOP83379	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Have a great day!
COOP83380	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She knows our names now. That makes me kinda
happy.
COOP83381	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Though when I asked her about rehab she
didn't have the best response	 huh?
COOP83382	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just hope she's okay...
COOP83384	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah... I'm sure you're right.
COOP83385	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You think? That's kind of you to say.
COOP83387	Store M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nager	You two done stocking the shelves? We've got
a whole other box of inventory to put out.
COOP83388	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 yes! We can handle it!
COOP83389	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Right	 I just remembered! Let me talk to the
manager about rearranging the merchandise.
COOP88230	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 {NAME2}-kun. Do you know any place
where I can study in peace?
COOP88231	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I have a quiz on a subject I'm not good at
tomorrow	 but both the library and diner are
packed today.
COOP88232	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I was thinking that if I found somewhere
good	 then maybe we could have a study
session together...
COOP88234	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Huh!? Would that be okay?
COOP88235	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Well	 if you say so...
COOP88237	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh... that's too bad. Thanks anyway. I'll try
looking elsewhere.
COOP88238	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Don't mind me...
COOP88239	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sorry. My schedule was packed with shifts
last week	 so I didn't get to study much...
COOP88240	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	...Um	 {NAME2}-kun. I know I should've asked
earlier	 but... Me coming over on the fly
like this... did I inconvenience you?
COOP88241	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Honestly	 I didn't expect our conversation
earlier to lead us straight here.
COOP88242	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I didn't even get anything to thank your
parents for having me over!
COOP88243	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	W-Well	 I suppose I should at least introduce
myself to them... It's the least I could do
for barging into your home like this.
COOP88245	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wha‚Äî!?
COOP88246	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Wait	 really?
COOP88247	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Come to think of it	 I do recall hearing that
your parents are away...
COOP88248	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Uh...
COOP88249	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Sorry	 everything's just hitting me at
once...
COOP88250	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But I'm happy we can study together in peace
without having to worry about others.
COOP88251	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	All right	 then. Let's get started	 {NAME2}.
COOP88252	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ready to hit the books again	 {NAME2}? Also	
wanna hang out when we're done?
COOP88300	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hi there. Would you happen to have time
today?
COOP88301	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Of course	 I totally get it if you have other
plans...
COOP88303	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Great	 thanks a lot!
COOP88305	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ahh okay	 no worries	 then. Thanks anyway.
COOP88310	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's my grandma's birthday soon. I thought
I'd put together a bouquet for her.
COOP88311	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's pretty spry for her age	 though her
health's taken a turn for the worse recently.
COOP88312	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Grandma's always been there for me so this is
my way of saying thanks.
COOP88313	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still	 I can't tell a daisy from a dandelion!
I could really use some help here...
COOP88315	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Great	 thank you so much!
COOP88316	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah... I guess you're right. Well then	 I'll
give it my best shot!
COOP88317	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	By the way	 are you doing anything after
this?
COOP88318	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Once we're done buying flowers	 why don't we
take a look around the shops here?
COOP88319	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't know about you	 but I really enjoy
the vibe of underground malls.
COOP88320	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	There's something new around every corner	
so you'll never get bored.
COOP88321	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've been coming here to check out the odd
outlet or boutique lately.
COOP88322	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I used to come here just for the sake of
shopping. Now I'm all about enjoying the
atmosphere and interior decor too.
COOP88323	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe my new part-time job's given me an eye
for detail? Or retail	 I guess you could say.
COOP88324	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Are there any stores around here that you'd
recommend? If so	 let me know!
COOP88325	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	And hey	 if they have an opening	 you should
apply! You'd be surprised at the things you
discover in a job.
COOP88350	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Talk about a city that never sleeps...
COOP88351	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I have an errand to run at the bookstore	
but it feels weird coming to this part of
town alone.
COOP88352	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Shinjuku has a ton of great shops	 so I come
here a lot with someone or another.
COOP88353	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That person would often be Motoha. We'd check
out the bookstore	 go see a movie...
COOP88354	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	She's been hard to get a hold of lately	 so I
found myself putting off this errand.
COOP88355	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So	 um	 you see... I'm glad you could come
with me.
COOP88357	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hee hee... Thanks all the same.
COOP88358	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	W-Well you're not wrong... There are a lot of
weird shops around here...
COOP88359	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	At any rate	 I'll be done soon. The bookstore
is just up ahead.
COOP88360	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is the only place I know that sells
minor league baseball magazines	 you see.
COOP88361	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So... Are you doing anything after this?
COOP88362	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Since we're here now	 it might be nice to see
a movie or something	 don't you think?
COOP88363	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I never come here on my own	 so there's still
lots of places I haven't been to.
COOP88364	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 and I bet there are places around here
looking for part-time staff.
COOP88380	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Since starting my part-time job	 I haven't
really decided what to do with my wage.
COOP88381	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	At first I thought about buying gifts for my
family	 or maybe my friends...
COOP88382	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But when I stopped and thought about it	
I haven't done anything to thank you	
have I?
COOP88383	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The last thing I'd want is to get you a
present that you end up not liking though...
COOP88384	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So I talked to Motoha about it	 and the idea
of taking you to Suidobashi came up!
COOP88385	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't know if a place like this is your
kind of thing	 but at any rate	 today's all
on me.
COOP88386	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Rides	 food	 the sky's the limit! So	 no
holding back	 okay?
COOP88388	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 I meant what I said. This was all my
idea	 after all! Go for it	 I mean it.
COOP88389	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That's right! Now then	 what do you want to
do first?
COOP88390	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Should we try a roller coaster? Or the Ferris
wheel? I heard good things about the food!
COOP88391	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is also my first time here too	 so I'm
pretty much down for anything.
COOP88392	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 and I want to get Motoha a souvenir. Let
me know if you want me to get you anything	
{NAME1}-kun.
COOP88394	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Say	 wanna do this again sometime? When our
schedules line up	 that is.
COOP88395	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	There's plenty of stuff we didn't get to try	
so maybe we can save those for next time!
COOP88410	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	There's a baseball stadium near this park	
you know.
COOP88411	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Motoha and I would come here a lot after
games when we were little.
COOP88412	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	When she brought it up today	 I found myself
on a trip down memory lane.
COOP88413	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh! Um... But of course	 that's not the only
reason I wanted to come here today!
COOP88414	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	A friend of mine works at one of the
refreshment stands around here...
COOP88415	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I told them about my part-time jobs	 and they
asked if I could help out	 too.
COOP88416	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	They only need me when things get super busy	
so I figured I'd give it a shot.
COOP88417	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This place reminds me of my baseball days	
so I kind of want to process my feelings.
COOP88418	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I thought that	 um	 maybe if I came with you	
then I could handle things a bit better.
COOP88419	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I know	 talk about selfish	 right? Sorry to
drag you out here like this.
COOP88421	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	If you're sure... Thank you. It means a lot
to me.
COOP88422	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hee hee	 thanks. Really	 though... Having you
here helps a lot.
COOP88423	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay... I think I'm ready now. I'm doing
this.
COOP88424	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Mind if I ping you on days I'm working here?
Maybe I can treat you to something.
COOP88440	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm a big fan of Inokashira Park	 you know.
COOP88441	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	My grandma loves taking walks	 so we came
here a lot when I was little.
COOP88442	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	The scenery is just so soothing throughout
the year‚Äîthe blossoms of spring	 the foliage
of fall	 you name it.
COOP88443	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmm? Oh	 no	 I don't have any particular
plans in the park today.
COOP88444	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I heard they're holding an information
session nearby for Tokyo volunteers	 though.
COOP88445	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I want to go	 but I get nervous just thinking
about it...
COOP88446	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then I remembered how you helped me out with
those part-time jobs. Thanks to you	 I was
able to walk right in there!
COOP88447	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Because of that	 I didn't have to feel so
anxious...
COOP88449	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 n-no	 it's nothing all that grand...
COOP88450	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Eh heh heh... Actually	 I haven't put much
thought into it	 either.
COOP88451	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I just want to experience more than just
part-time work. That's all	 really.
COOP88452	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What about you	 {NAME1}-kun? Are you
interested in volunteering?
COOP88453	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Unlike part-time work	 the only money you get
is for your travel expenses.
COOP88454	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Still	 you get to do all sorts of cool stuff!
Helping cats get adopted	 things like that.
COOP88455	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'll let you know when I hear about anything
that sounds interesting	 okay?
COOP89982	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Whoa! Is this... for me?
COOP89983	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'm super happy right now! You know	 I've
wanted something like this for a while!
COOP89984	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I can't believe I got a present from you!
Thanks so much! Ehehe...
COOP89985	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is for me?
COOP89986	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I was just thinking I wanted something like
this. Thanks! I'm really happy.
COOP89988	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	What do you wanna do? I'll let you choose
where we go.
COOP89989	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh... That's fine. Maybe next time	 yeah?
COOP89990	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 I was thinking the same! Let's go then!
COOP89991	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I dunno...  I'd rather go somewhere else	
if that's okay? Sorry.
COOP89992	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I heard that store has some new stuff for
sale. Want to go check it out?
COOP89993	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Where should we go today? There's so many
choices	 I just can't choose...
COOP89994	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 what do you want to ride today? I was
thinking...
COOP89995	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Coming to this park always helps me relax...
Thanks for coming along with me.
COOP89996	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I love places with so much green around. It's
so soothing.
COOP90000	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>permarket Employee	Excuse me	 miss. You can't take individual
tomatoes out of there.
COOP90001	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>permarket Employee	These here are sold individually. Those are
sold by the pack.
COOP90002	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Sorry! I misread the explanation! So then	
can I take from this? Wait	 no...
COOP90005	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Huh? Oh! Thank you so much!
COOP90006	Troubled G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl	Sometimes I have trouble reading Japanese...
COOP90007	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Um	 these are on clearance because the
expiration date is soon	 right? But it's
still okay if I eat it today?
COOP90008	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	And this produce is on sale	 but it's not any
different from the regular produce?
COOP90009	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Does that mean the same produce outside the
bargain box is discounted too? Or not?
COOP90010	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	...is discounted	 too? Or not?
COOP90012	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Phew! Thanks so much for explaining all that
to me! You were a huge help!
COOP90013	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Actually	 do you have a bit more time to
spare?
COOP90014	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Girl	Hurray! I'm <color=#FF423F>Yaoling Li</color>.
COOP90015	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm an exchange student from Sichuan	 China
studying at a Japanese college. I live around
this area.
COOP90016	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Japan's still such a mystery to me. This sort
of thing happens pretty much on the daily.
COOP90017	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And you're	 um...?
COOP90019	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah	 {NAME1}-san! Got it! You shop here
a lot?
COOP90021	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ohhh! Then today's my lucky day for sure!
COOP90022	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whoops	 I just remembered! I gotta go buy
some tea...
COOP90023	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do you know any place around here that sells
tea in bulk	 {NAME1}-san?
COOP90024	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The boxes I found here are baby-sized! I'm
used to buying waaay bigger ones back home.
COOP90026	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 I figured there were none around here.
COOP90027	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I still don't know many people around here	
and there's a lot of stuff I don't understand.
COOP90028	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Like the other day	 the light went out in my
room	 so I had to call the landlord	 and it
became this whole thing.
COOP90029	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I know fluorescent lightbulbs	 but what the
heck are "incandescent" ones? I've never even
seen those at the store.
COOP90030	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's why	 um... If it's all right with you	
I have a bit of a favor to ask.
COOP90031	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Please be my friend!
COOP90033	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You mean it!? Thank you so much! I really
appreciate it!
COOP90034	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Awww... Pretty please	 with sugar on top?
I could really use a friend right now...
COOP90036	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Of course! You just did me a huge solid back
there. You seem like a great guy!
COOP90037	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank goodness! Pleased to meet you	 friend!
COOP90038	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank goodness! Pleased to meet you	 friend!
COOP90039	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 but I guess there's nothing for you to
get out of this	 huh?
COOP90040	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Relationships are about give and take	 right?
I can't be the only one benefiting!
COOP90041	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'll think up a way to thank you by the next
time we meet!
COOP90044	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Now let's track down some tea	 huh!?
COOP90045	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Gonna find a shop‚ô™ that sells some tea!‚ô™
I can practically taste those leaves already!
COOP90100	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hey	 {NAME1}-san! Have a second?
COOP90101	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There's something I wanted to get your
opinion on.
COOP90103	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hurray! Thank you! Let's walk and talk.
COOP90104	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	No worries! Let me know when you have time.
COOP90105	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I've been having a bit of a problem lately.
COOP90106	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Before coming to study abroad	 Mama and Papa
said to me...
COOP90160	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Go learn and experience other cultures.
COOP90107	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Of all the countries	 I figured Japan
wouldn't be too difficult for me to wrap
my head around.
COOP90108	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still... Once I got into my exchange program	
the wind kinda fell outta my sails.
COOP90109	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Since then I haven't felt very motivated
about my studies.
COOP90111	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hmmm... I was actually hoping you could help
me figure that out.
COOP90112	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Nope... No good at all.
COOP90113	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I do	 that's who! After all the money my
folks shelled out for this	 I have to!
COOP90114	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But... When I stop and think about it	
there's nothing I really want to do in Japan.
COOP90115	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I mean	 I like studying the language	 and my
life here is far from boring	 it's just...
COOP90116	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I find myself thinking	 "Why exactly did I
come here?"
COOP90117	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's kind of funny when you think about it.
I'm the one who chose this.
COOP90119	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah. Really tough.
COOP90120	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah	 sorry... I might not seem that worried	
but it really is a problem.
COOP90121	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You might be right	 but if this keeps up I'll
be in real trouble!
COOP90122	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If I had to guess	 I'd say I was missing
something from the start.
COOP90124	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Once I chose Japan	 Papa got serious about
making sure I study hard and learn a lot. But
the thing is...
COOP90125	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I don't think I ever thought about why it's
important to study other cultures.
COOP90126	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Now here I am all the way in Japan	 but it
feels like a waste.
COOP90127	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	What would you do in my shoes?
COOP90129	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You're so right	 {NAME1}-san! I was thinking
the same thing.
COOP90130	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Sorry to throw this at you out of the blue	
but it's important to me.
COOP90131	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I never realized before	 but having nothing
to do is actually soul-crushing.
COOP90132	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So	 would you help me figure out what it is
I want to do?
COOP90133	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 wait. Does this not mean "please"? Um	
hang on	 was there a more polite way to do
this?
COOP90134	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I need to find my reason for being in this
country. Please	 please	 PLEASE help me!
COOP90136	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank you so much! You're my own personal
Zhuge Liang!
COOP90137	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Trust me	 I know how vague a request this
is... But you're doing me a huge solid by
helping!
COOP90138	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm sure you'll be able to help! Like	 all
that stuff you taught me at the supermarket?
Super helpful!
COOP90139	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Um	 but if this is too much for you	
I totally understand	 {NAME1}-san...
COOP90140	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank goodness. In that case	 {NAME1}-san	
I'm going to call you "Sensei" from now on!
COOP90141	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh! And I've been thinking...
COOP90142	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	As thanks for helping me out	 I'll give you
tons of tools and recipes I know!
COOP90143	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hehe	 gotta look out for each other	 don't
you think!
COOP90146	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Now you're officially my trusted advisor
and buddy	 Sensei!
COOP90147	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hehe	 I'm counting on your guidance!
COOP90148	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Man...
COOP90149	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Here I was	 stuck by myself with these
thoughts swirling around my head about what
comes next.
COOP90150	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But after talking to you	 I'm starting to
feel excited about the future.
COOP90151	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks for the advice	 Sensei!
COOP90152	D<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>gnified H<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>gh Schooler	Oh	 hello there	 Yaoling.
COOP90153	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh! Howdy	 <color=#FF423F>Yukimi</color>-san!
COOP90154	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's my dear neighbor	 Yukimi Fujikawa.
COOP90155	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Super courteous	 that one. She may be younger
than me	 but I respect the heck out of her.
COOP90156	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Wait. Now that I think about it	 you're
younger than me too aren't you	 Sensei?
COOP90157	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Agh! I gotta get my act together! I have to
find a purpose fast!
COOP90200	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	'Sup	 {NAME1}-san! There's somewhere I wanna
go with you today.
COOP90201	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do you have time right now?
COOP90203	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank you	 thank you	 thank you! So I want to
go to Jinbocho.
COOP90204	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ever since I was little	 reading about other
countries helped me feel closer to them.
COOP90205	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So	 I figured that reading up on Japan...
COOP90206	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	...would make things feel a bit more familiar
to me!
COOP90207	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's okay. Let me know when you're free.
COOP90209	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yaoling and I came to
Book Town in Jinbocho.
COOP90210	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ooh! I heard about all the bookstores here	
but the stories don't do it justice!
COOP90211	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I heard from my Japanese teacher that some of
the booksellers here are chummy with Chinese
literary masters.
COOP90212	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh my gosh I'm so fricken excited! Come on	
Sensei! The browsing awaits!
COOP90213	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Huh? This whole shop only has books by a
single publisher!
COOP90214	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	How do they even stay in business?
COOP90215	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah! That store is full of scripts from movies
and TV shows!
COOP90216	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whoa... This place has WAY more than just
secondhand books. Amazing!
COOP90217	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That store sells needles for vinyl record
players...
COOP90218	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Never thought I'd see a record outside of
those old-timey Hong Kong movies!
COOP90219	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	AAAAAA==
COOP90220	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	*pant* *pant* There's... so much... left to
see...
COOP90221	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But I've got a serious case of jelly legs...
COOP90223	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 you're right... I went a bit too hard
out the gate.
COOP90224	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh man. Realizing now I should've gone in
with more of a plan. Sorry...
COOP90225	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 you're right. Slow and steady wins
the race.
COOP90226	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 you know I hear Jinbocho's famous for its
curry. Let's take a break for a bite!
COOP90228	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Phew! That sure was tasty! I see why it's
famous.
COOP90229	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Spicy food always perks me up.
COOP90230	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I am from Sichuan after all!
COOP90232	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Couldn't call this spicy where I come from.
More like mild I guess. Tasty	 though.
COOP90233	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But you'll never know what something's really
like without trying it for yourself.
COOP90234	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	With all these books here	 I expected there'd
be more students.
COOP90235	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Maybe the other kids are lacking purpose in
their studies too.
COOP90237	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You think so too? I guess it's no problem for
some people...
COOP90238	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm right there with 'em. Searching for a
purpose.
COOP90239	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Well	 if they've got something to be
passionate about	 that's amazing in its
own right.
COOP90240	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But why was Papa so eager for me to study
abroad?
COOP90241	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I never heard him talk about foreign
countries or anything before. Hmm...
COOP90243	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Reasons... Like wanting me to experience life
overseas somewhere? Japan or otherwise.
COOP90244	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I guess he wants me to learn something from
studying abroad.
COOP90245	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank you so so so much! Just hearing you say
that's enough to get me motivated again!
COOP90246	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Papa never really explained his thought
process	 so it's hard to say...
COOP90247	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But now I have my wonderful sensei to help me
figure it out	 so I'll think on it real hard!
COOP90249	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh! Let's go to yum cha at one of those shops
over there!
COOP90250	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm actually a bit of an expert when it comes
to tea and dim sum.
COOP90251	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Consider it thanks for hanging out with me
all day	 Sensei!
COOP90252	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hmmm... You can't go wrong with milk tea	
but I really think some Longjing would hit
the spot right now.
COOP90253	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But maybe something sweet would be best to
fill you up after all that browsing.
COOP90300	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hey	 {NAME1}-san! I wanna go somewhere with
you today.
COOP90301	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do you have any plans after this?
COOP90303	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hurray! Thank you! All aboard for adventure	
choo choo!
COOP90304	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I see... Well	 gimme a holler next time
you're free then!
COOP90305	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yaoling and I came
to Harajuku...
COOP90306	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh boy	 so this is Harajuku! Just look at all
the hustle and bustle!
COOP90307	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Jinbocho was so old-school...
COOP90308	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So I figured we'd go see where all the kids
hang out this time!
COOP90309	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Holy cow! All the people here are so trendy!
COOP90310	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whoa... They've even got maids here!?
COOP90311	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I thought you only saw them in Akihabara.
Harajuku sure is somethin' else!
COOP90313	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You don't say! This whole place reminds me of
the huge shopping malls in Chengdu.
COOP90314	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Just like here	 there're tons of people
celebrating the stuff they're into.
COOP90315	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	This place is just as packed! And there're
clothing stores and accessory shops
everywhere!
COOP90316	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	No wonder it's such a fashion hotspot! And
it's not just luxury brands either.
COOP90317	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You can find quirky shops with cheap items
all over.
COOP90318	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	They're called thrift stores	 right?
COOP90319	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yaaay	 I got it right! So this place is about
more than just buying fashionable clothes...
COOP90320	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's about putting together a style all
your own!
COOP90321	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whaaat the‚Äî? Look at the sweets those guys
got! Even the snacks here are funky!
COOP90322	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Strawberry skewers	 rainbow cotton candy...
CHURROS!?
COOP90323	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So much trendy stuff!
COOP90324	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still	 if you're in Harajuku	 it's gotta be
cr√™pes	 right? I saw that on TV.
COOP90325	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'd prefer spicy over sweet though... Do you
think they make spicy cr√™pes!?
COOP90327	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm just kiddiiing! Well	 mostly. I certainly
wouldn't say no if they had it.
COOP90328	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah! There's a cr√™pe place right there. I'll
go buy a couple.
COOP90329	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	This one's blueberry and sour cream. And this
one with the lettuce is...
COOP90331	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah! Check it out! The Killer Cayenne
Crunch! Hehe	 just messing with you.
COOP90332	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	This is a savory tomato-sauce cr√™pe.
COOP90333	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I thought it looked yummy like a pizza.
COOP90334	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even my eye for spice couldn't suss out a
proper hot cr√™pe.
COOP90335	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Go on	 take whichever one you like!
COOP90339	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Seeing all these young people here today
kinda boosted my spirits.
COOP90340	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I mean	 I know I'm also young	 so maybe that
doesn't make a lot of sense	 but...
COOP90341	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	All the kids here look like they're having so
much fun.
COOP90342	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	They're totally focused on the things they
love	 regardless of what people think.
COOP90343	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	They know exactly why they're here...
Unlike me.
COOP90345	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 for sure. I should find my own path
without comparing myself to others.
COOP90346	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I know you're right	 but I'm way too restless
for that	 heheh...
COOP90347	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oooh	 Sensei	 you sound like one of those
wushu masters! Way cool!
COOP90348	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks for today	 Sensei. Here's a little
something for you.
COOP90351	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	All of the dishes in here are delicious. They
get the Yaoling seal of approval!
COOP90352	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	All right	 let's call it here for today. I'm
gonna try to make a spicy cr√™pe at home!
COOP90353	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	See you again	 Sensei!
COOP90400	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 hey	 {NAME1}-kun. I could really use
your advice today...
COOP90401	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Are you free?
COOP90403	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hurray! Thanks! Okay	 let's get our walk and
talk on!
COOP90404	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Aw	 okay... Well	 let me know when you're
around.
COOP90405	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Today	 we're having a strategy session.
COOP90406	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Jinbocho and Harajuku were so cool	 and I
learned a whole bunch from them.
COOP90407	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That got me thinking	 the next place I want
to go is‚Äî
COOP90408	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 Fujikawa-san.
COOP90410	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 come on	 I told you about her before.
She's my next-door neighbor!
COOP90411	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Exactly! The girl right next door! We chatted
a bit outside the movie theater the other
day.
COOP90412	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hehe	 we've gotten a bit closer since then	
you kno‚Äî
COOP90413	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ern Middle-Aged Woman	I don't care how you feel about it.
COOP90414	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ern Middle-Aged W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Just do as you're told. THAT is the
proper way!
COOP90415	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Yes	 Mother.
COOP90416	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	......
COOP90417	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yuki...
COOP90418	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Poor Yukimi-san... You think she's okay?
COOP90419	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She looked so sad... I can't help but worry
about her.
COOP90420	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She told me a bit about herself before. She said
her father died when she was little...
COOP90421	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And her mother worked herself to the bone	
building a company from the ground up.
COOP90422	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She's raised Yukimi-san to be her successor.
Pretty harshly	 from the sounds of it.
COOP90423	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still	 that's no way for a mother to talk to
her daughter! Not at all!
COOP90424	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I hate to think what Yukimi-san must be
feeling...
COOP90425	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I know she might seem a little stiff at first
glance	 but I've seen how kind she is.
COOP90426	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You should see the tranquil look on her face
when she pets the neighborhood dogs. She's
such a sweet girl!
COOP90427	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	AAAAAA==
COOP90429	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Exactly! I can't look the other way after
seeing her get yelled at like that.
COOP90430	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You're not wrong	 but that kind of family
dynamic clearly isn't normal...
COOP90431	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I don't know all of the details either... But
her mother says stuff that makes her cry.
That's not right.
COOP90432	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm here now trying to figure out what my
future's supposed to be.
COOP90433	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But the idea of someone else deciding my
entire future for me...
COOP90434	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Someone who refuses to take anything I think
or feel into consideration...
COOP90435	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I don't think I could take it...
COOP90437	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Wow! That's a great idea	 Sensei! You've got
the answers for everything.
COOP90438	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	We'll do just that. The poor girl's at her
wit's end	 I can tell.
COOP90439	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Next time we'll all hang out! You	 me	 and
Yukimi-san makes three!
COOP90440	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 and leave the location to me!
COOP90441	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There's a place I wanted to ask you about
anyway.
COOP90443	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks as always	 oh wise and powerful
Sensei!
COOP90444	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I hope you're looking forward to next time as
much as I am!
COOP90500	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 Yukimi-san! I'm so glad you could make
it today!
COOP90501	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You remember {PLAYER_NAME}-san	 right?
He's my sensei!
COOP90502	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	He's been teaching me all sorts of things
about life here in Japan.
COOP90504	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The pleasure is all mine. Thank you for
extending the invitation.
COOP90505	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Ah yes	 outside of the train station. You
were with Yaoling-san then as well.
COOP90506	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
COOP90507	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I see... A master-disciple dynamic	 was it?
Pleased to meet you.
COOP90508	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And this is Yukimi-san	 the nicest neighbor a
girl could ever ask for! Hehe.
COOP90509	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Okay	 let's get this train a rollin'! It's
a bit of a hike	 but I promise it'll be
worth it!
COOP90510	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Behold! Asakusa! Just look at this crowd.
It's like a festival!
COOP90511	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Check out all the sweet treats! Rice
crackers	 dango	 even baby castellas!
COOP90512	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 but if we're gonna try them all	 we'll
need some tea too.
COOP90513	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I don't know about baby castellas	 but I
think Japanese tea would go best with the
other snacks.
COOP90514	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Hmhm	 exactly right	 Yaoling-san. I see
you've done your research on the area.
COOP90515	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Wait	 I was right? WOO! All right	 let's take
a tea-filled tour of Nakamise Street for some
yummy snackaroos!
COOP90516	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	AAAAAA==
COOP90518	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh boy	 this is the life! My tummy's filled
to the brim!
COOP90519	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	......
COOP90520	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	You two invited me here today to lift my
spirits	 correct?
COOP90521	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Pfff	 whaaaat? Nooo...
COOP90522	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	You have my utmost thanks. Also...
COOP90523	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Please accept my sincere apologies for my
disgraceful display the other day.
COOP90524	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Please	 don't apologize.
COOP90525	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	More importantly	 are you okay? It sounded
like your mother said some really harsh
things to you.
COOP90526	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	It was my fault for not listening to her.
COOP90527	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Not just anyone could manage raising a child
and running a business all on her own.
COOP90528	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Yes	 Mother's way of speaking may seem
harsh...
COOP90529	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	But she does so out of necessity because
she holds herself and others to a higher
standard.
COOP90530	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	AAAAAA==
COOP90531	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I get where you're coming from	 but you're
her daughter.
COOP90532	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Mother knows best. That's the way it's
always been.
COOP90533	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	My inability to comprehend that fully is just
further proof of my inexperience and
immaturity.
COOP90535	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yes	 he's right. Are you really happy being
treated this way	 Fujikawa-san?
COOP90536	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You plan on helping out with your mother's
work when you're done with school	 right?
COOP90537	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Isn't there anything else you want to do?
Want to be?
COOP90538	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	What I want...
COOP90539	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I want... to help people in trouble. I want
to fight for them... as a lawyer.
COOP90540	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	But what does it matter what I want?
Everything my mother does is for my sake.
COOP90541	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	......
COOP90542	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	It seems like everyone's headed home. Shall
we retire for today as well?
COOP90543	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Thank you for your invitation. I had a
wonderful time with you.
COOP90544	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	This may not be an adequate expression of my
gratitude...
COOP90545	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	But please allow me to invite you both to
one of my favorite places in return for your
kindness.
COOP90546	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I believe it will help greatly with
Yaoling-san's efforts to learn more about
Japan.
COOP90548	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah	 yes! For sure! We'd be happy to join you!
COOP90549	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's right! We do! Of course	 we'd be happy
to join you!
COOP90550	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Uh	 right! I'm sure it will be. Thanks for
the invite! We'd love to join you.
COOP90551	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Wonderful. I'll be on my way home then.
I look forward to the next time we meet.
COOP90552	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Phew! Glad to see Yukimi-san's doing better
than I thought she'd be...
COOP90553	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still	 I'm worrying about this stuff with her
mother even more than before.
COOP90554	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	At the very least	 we've made plans to meet
again. It seems like it'll take time	 but all
we can do is keep talking to her.
COOP90556	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks a bunch for today	 Sensei.
COOP90557	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Since you made the effort to visit the temple
with me	 here's this charm I bought!
COOP90558	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	See you!
COOP90570	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yo	 {NAME1}-san! So I was thinking we'd
invite Fujikawa-san to hang out today.
COOP90571	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do you have some time?
COOP90573	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Great! Let's meet up on the train platform!
COOP90574	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's a shame... Let's give it another shot
when our schedules line up.
COOP90600	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	What sort of place are we going to today?
COOP90601	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Hmmm... A place of respite	 I suppose?
I would be remiss if I ruined the surprise.
COOP90602	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Here we are. This caf√© was once a traditional
Japanese house! This floor and transom are
prime examples of Japanese architecture.
COOP90603	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whoa! So this is what they look like... The
natural woodgrain look is really soothing.
COOP90604	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	Pardon me.
COOP90605	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whoa	 is this	 like	 REAL matcha? And the
sweets look so fancy!
COOP90606	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	While not a proper tea house per se	 the fare
they serve is more than adequate for the tea
ceremony.
COOP90607	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Experiencing them in a carefree atmosphere
such as this seemed a perfect opportunity for
enriching your knowledge of Japan.
COOP90608	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yaaay! Thanks	 Yukimi-san. Learning with tea
and treats is the best!
COOP90609	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Though they provide authentic earthenware	
I believe we can forgo the usual formalities.
COOP90611	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Hmhmhm! Every aspect	 from tea temperature
to the order the sweets are brought out	 is
carefully choreographed.
COOP90612	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	All devised for the sake of the customer's
enjoyment.
COOP90613	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The tea ceremony is the very embodiment of
Japan's culture of wholehearted hospitality.
COOP90614	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Wow	 Yukimi-san. You sure know a bunch about
tea ceremonies.
COOP90615	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Mother says such knowledge is essential for a
business manager to possess.
COOP90616	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I studied flower arranging for the same
reason.
COOP90617	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ahhh	 I see.
COOP90618	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Go on	 Yaoling-san. Give the tea a try.
COOP90619	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hmmm. I see what you're saying about this
place.
COOP90620	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	At first	 I was a bit hesitant about the
tea's bitter aftertaste and the slight
blandness of the sweets...
COOP90621	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But the flavors complement each other
perfectly!
COOP90622	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	This combination could've only come from a
whole bunch of trial and error	 no doubt.
COOP90624	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Not even a little. But I'm kinda glad you
think so.
COOP90625	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hey! Rude! I mean you're right‚Äîbut rude!
COOP90626	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's true	 I know. Go on	 now. Keep the
praise coming!
COOP90627	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I believe Yaoling appreciates the finer
points of tea quite well.
COOP90628	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I am very glad I brought you here.
COOP90629	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There is one thing I'm curious about. Ah	
excuse me!
COOP90630	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Would you happen to have any yellow tea	
or perhaps pu'er tea?
COOP90631	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I bet they'd go really well with this sweet
bean jelly.
COOP90632	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	!?
COOP90633	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	Ah	 I beg your pardon	 miss. I'm afraid we
don't have any at this establishment.
COOP90634	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 really? That's too bad...
COOP90635	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah	 then maybe	 would it be possible for my
next cup of tea to be a bit hotter?
COOP90636	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	My deepest apologies	 but the experience we
offer here is...
COOP90637	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Yaoling-san. The tea ceremony is a
conversation between the proprietor and
the customer.
COOP90638	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The latter consumes what is provided	
learning of the unique flavor the former has
worked to develop.
COOP90639	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Proper etiquette dictates the customer
strive...
COOP90640	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	...to accept and appreciate what they've
been given.
COOP90641	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	If you want to understand Japan	 accepting
this principle is crucial.
COOP90642	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Accepting... Hmmm...
COOP90643	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Learning isn't about accepting what you're
told at face value.
COOP90644	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I appreciate that this place put a lot of
thought into how it serves everything.
And everything was real tasty.
COOP90645	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But...
COOP90646	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still	 I can't help but think of a few things
here and there I would personally do
differently...
COOP90647	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I just expressed my thoughts... Is that a
bad thing?
COOP90648	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Oh! Um...
COOP90650	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yukimi-san	 you said before that your wants
don't matter because listening to your mother
is the right thing to do.
COOP90651	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But I don't think that's right. I saw the
pain in your face.
COOP90652	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You have things you want to do. A purpose of
your own.
COOP90653	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yet here you are taking your mother's word
as gospel.
COOP90654	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	*gasp*
COOP90655	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Can you seriously just accept that!?
COOP90656	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	What does that have to do with anything!?
You know nothing about me or my life!
COOP90657	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I apologize... I misspoke‚Äî
COOP90658	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	No	 I'm the one who should apologize.
I didn't mean to get on your case like that...
COOP90659	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Sorry about today	 Sensei.
COOP90660	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I just felt like I had to say something	 and
I had to say it there.
COOP90661	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Accepting tenet is how that caf√© does
things... I get that now.
COOP90662	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Painfully so...
COOP90663	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And of course I feel bad about calling
Yukimi-san out and troubling the staff	
but...
COOP90664	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even so	 it just bothers me...
COOP90665	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Why is it so important to behave exactly how
someone else expects you to?
COOP90666	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But maybe I'm being a hypocrite...
COOP90667	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I mean	 I came all the way to Japan to please
my parents.
COOP90668	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Maybe I'm just projecting my problems onto
Yukimi-san.
COOP90670	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah? You think so too	 don't you	 Sensei?
COOP90671	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I probably could've phrased things better
though.
COOP90673	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I feel a bit better now. Well	 that's all I
wanted to say. Later	 Sensei...
COOP90690	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Howdy do	 {NAME1}-san! Yukimi-san asked me
which day would be good for us to hang out.
COOP90692	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Does today work? Too sudden?
COOP90693	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Great! She wants to meet in Asakusa. Let's
head on over!
COOP90694	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 all right. I'll just let her know. We'll
figure out a day that works for all of us.
COOP90700	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I've been thinking about what to say to
Yukimi-san.
COOP90701	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She's such a kind person. I know that better
than anybody.
COOP90702	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Despite that	 I went in guns blazing without
taking a second to think about her feelings	
and made her really upset.
COOP90704	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's a great idea! I knew I could count on
you	 Sensei.
COOP90705	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 I have to do this properly. I'll need
to make an opportunity to apologize and talk
it out.
COOP90706	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 I don't wanna just hit her with a
drive-by apology. We need to sit down and
hash things out.
COOP90707	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yukimi-san is really earnest. I'm sure if I
sit down and talk to her seriously she'll
listen	 right?
COOP90708	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I've decided to invite her to Chinese tea.
That's the least I can do	 but...
COOP90709	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm really worried.
COOP90710	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Saying I'm sorry for what I said just for the
sake of making up doesn't feel right.
COOP90711	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Because I'm not sorry for what I said. I said
it for her sake!
COOP90712	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So what then? Make up superficially? Lie and
say I didn't mean what I said? That won't
help Yukimi-san.
COOP90714	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hit her with the truth... Yeah... Hit 'er
with the truth!
COOP90715	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah... I have to be upfront and express
myself clearly. It's not just about getting
forgiveness.
COOP90716	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Well	 when you put it that way	 there's
really no other path forward	 is there?
COOP90717	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The whole point is to understand each other.
Can't go avoiding the heart of it.
COOP90718	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks a million	 Sensei!
COOP90719	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even when I'm at my lowest you're always
there supporting me.
COOP90721	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Phew! I feel sooo much better. Thanks	
Sensei.
COOP90722	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I think I'm gonna do a little shopping now.
Wanna come with?
COOP90723	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'd love to get your opinion.
COOP90724	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Come on! Swashbuckling shopping and
tea-sipping adventures await!
COOP90725	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh boy... I can't believe we shopped all the
way from Shin-Okubo to Shinjuku.
COOP90726	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	My feet are killing me	 but I had a really
good time!
COOP90727	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There's loads of long-standing Chinese food	
tea	 and sundry shops around here...
COOP90728	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Great for times like this!
COOP90729	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Now all that's left is to prepare for battle!
COOP90731	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The whole point of this tea party is to sit
down with Yukimi-san	 so I'm real motivated.
COOP90732	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Exactly. I've gotta be ready to give it
my all.
COOP90733	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah! Thanks! Believe me	 I'm just getting
started.
COOP90734	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yukimi-san's just so put-together...
COOP90735	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If I don't take this seriously	 there's no
way she'll hear me out.
COOP90736	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's why I've really steeled myself
for this.
COOP90737	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But that's not the only reason.
COOP90738	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I can't help but get excited when my favorite
Chinese tea is in the mix.
COOP90739	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There's no way I can let myself lose on my
home turf.
COOP90740	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Anyway	 thanks so much for today	 Sensei.
COOP90741	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If I'd had to deal with this on my own	
I would've stewed over it until I ended up
spitting out some half-hearted apology.
COOP90742	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	......
COOP90743	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still	 why do you always stick by me	 Sensei?
You're always here when I need you...
COOP90744	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You're so busy with school and all	 but you
take the time to go shopping with me and
stuff...
COOP90747	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	O-Oh...
COOP90748	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Sorry for asking such a weird question! Um	
anyway! I'm looking forward to the tea party!
COOP90750	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Huh? Special? Wait	 so	 that means...
COOP90751	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If you use words like that	 I... I might read
into it a little bit	 you know...
COOP90752	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Or... Are you saying what I think you're
saying?
COOP90753	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	O-Oh boy	 this is sudden. Um... I've felt the
same for a while...
COOP90756	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So	 Sensei... Would you happen to have...
a little more time to spare?
COOP90790	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah... Um	 I'd like to talk about what
happened with Yukimi-san the other day.
COOP90791	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do you have time today?
COOP90793	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Great. Let's walk and talk.
COOP90794	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 all right. I'll just let her know. We'll
figure out a day that works for all of us.
COOP90800	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 Sensei! I'm thinking today's the day to
talk to Yukimi-san.
COOP90801	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Are you free?
COOP90803	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Great! Let's head over right away! Today
we're headin' for Yokohama.
COOP90804	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 okay... In that case	 let's pick a time
when we're all free.
COOP90805	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I am quite looking forward to trying your
Chinese tea recommendations	 Yaoling-san.
COOP90806	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'd hope so! I've prepared only the best for
you	 Yukimi-san. Ah	 over here!
COOP90807	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Today's a special menu I personally asked
the owner to prepare.
COOP90808	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	First we have this Chinese tea	 aaand...
COOP90809	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	This Japanese sweet bean jelly to go with.
COOP90810	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Huh?
COOP90811	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The tea is a faint yellow... with a unique
aroma.
COOP90812	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Please	 try it with this tea too. Let me pour
it now so the flavor doesn't get too strong.
COOP90813	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	This deep indigo color... Or perhaps it is
more of a light crimson? Both are exquisite.
COOP90814	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The first tea is huangcha. A yellow tea	 rare
even in China.
COOP90815	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The second is a diluted pot of pu'er.
A fermented tea you can find anywhere.
COOP90816	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Softening the flavor helps it pair better
with the sweet bean jelly.
COOP90817	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And lastly	 we have lotus seed soup.
A Chinese sweet made with powdered sugar
and corn syrup...
COOP90818	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Accompanied by Japanese sencha green tea.
COOP90819	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I think you might find this dessert similar
to simmered Japanese red beans.
COOP90820	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I know you don't see lotus seeds used in
Japanese sweets very often	 but they're used
as a paste in Chinese sweets regularly.
COOP90821	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	They're milder than beans	 so they suit
Japanese tea quite well.
COOP90822	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The rich history of Chinese tea varies
greatly by region.
COOP90823	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I tapped into a few of their distinctive
flavor profiles to produce this meal.
COOP90824	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Given the regional diversity	 it's no
surprise that there're infinite ways of
pairing teas and sweets together.
COOP90825	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's what I think	 at least.
COOP90826	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	You may be right	 Yaoling-san. Every pairing
you gave me was delicious.
COOP90827	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Even so	 please remember what I explained to
you before regarding the tea ceremony.
COOP90828	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The crux of it lies in creating a deep
understanding between proprietor and
customer.
COOP90829	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Its established form and etiquette are all
for the sake of that purpose.
COOP90830	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	......
COOP90831	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The customer is there to comprehend the
intentions of the proprietor.
COOP90832	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	This may be difficult to understand from the
outside	 but that is how it is.
COOP90833	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Neither party is meant to share ideas
contrary to what's been decided	 no matter
how respectable they might be.
COOP90834	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	As such	 this is not comparable to the
culture of tea ceremony.
COOP90835	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If you value everything by tea ceremony
standards	 we'll never understand each
other...
COOP90838	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 you're right. No point in any of this
if I back down now.
COOP90839	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You know	 Yukimi-san	 there's something I've
gotta ask after hearing you say that.
COOP90840	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do the beliefs you have about tea ceremony
reflect your own personal feelings?
COOP90841	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Or are they just something somebody told you
was proper?
COOP90842	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Well	 you see...
COOP90843	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	People often talk about the millennia of
history behind Chinese cuisine.
COOP90844	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But you know	 chilis didn't come to Sichuan
until about 500 years ago.
COOP90845	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If people back then had decided that chilis
weren't a proper Sichuan seasoning	 well...
COOP90846	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Mapo tofu wouldn't exist anywhere in the
world.
COOP90847	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	......
COOP90848	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even if you want to hold the tea ceremony in
high regard	 that's an unshakable reality.
COOP90849	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's hard to say if something's actually
valuable unless you assess it for yourself.
COOP90850	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Personally	 I have no idea if other people's
right ideas are right for me!
COOP90851	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I mean	 the only person who can decide what's
right for me is me!
COOP90852	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah	 um... Sorry. I just can't stop talking	
huh?
COOP90853	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's just	 I think you're the nicest person
in the whole wide world	 Yukimi-san...
COOP90854	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And I know there's something you really want
to do with your life. So...
COOP90855	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So I just want you to live the way you
want to.
COOP90856	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	......
COOP90857	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Yes	 I see that.
COOP90858	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Hmhmhm! Strange. My heart feels so warm and
full right now.
COOP90859	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Huh?
COOP90860	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I've gained so much from our tea party today.
COOP90861	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	You have my thanks	 Yaoling-san. When it
comes to tea service	 your acumen is
unquestionable.
COOP90862	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Did I get through to her...?
COOP90864	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If you think so	 Sensei	 then... I'm sure
it'll be all right!
COOP90865	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah	 fair enough. Here's hoping she heard
what I had to say.
COOP90866	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yeah... For now	 that's about all we can do.
COOP90867	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	At least I was able to get everything off
my chest.
COOP90869	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thank you for today	 Sensei. It's hardly
enough to express my gratitude	 but here.
COOP90871	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You know	 it's thanks to chilis and Sichuan
pepper that we have mapo tofu and
mouthwatering chicken.
COOP90872	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I really admire the ingenuity of the people
who came up with that!
COOP90874	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh boy! Not gonna lie	 that was exhausting...
COOP90875	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Follow me. I know another spot where we can
relax a bit.
COOP90876	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You don't mind	 right?
COOP90900	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Sensei! Hey! Are you free today? I've got
something important to talk to you about.
COOP90902	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hurray! Thanks! I wanted to update you about
the Yukimi-san sitch as soon as I could.
COOP90903	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 I see... Come back and hear me out when
you've got a minute.
COOP90904	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So I talked to Yukimi-san after the tea
party	 and she thanked me again for
everything.
COOP90905	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She really appreciated how concerned I was
for her.
COOP90906	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And get this	 she apologized for labeling me
an aimless slacker.
COOP90907	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Aimless slacker! How much ruder can you get!?
COOP90908	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Still	 she's gotten to the point where she
can tell me how she really feels straight up.
COOP90909	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And she said I opened her eyes to a lot of
stuff at the tea party. Hehehe!
COOP90910	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh. And Yukimi-san plans on talking things
out with her mother.
COOP90911	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She really wants to become a lawyer
after all!
COOP90912	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	She wants to help people in need; the same
way she wanted to help her mother way back
when.
COOP90913	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Such a nice sentiment	 don't you think?
COOP90915	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You know	 I feel like I learned a lot from
this experience.
COOP90916	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Coming to Japan to study doesn't mean I have
to follow their way of doing things without
question.
COOP90917	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And I also can't go pushing my own beliefs
onto other people.
COOP90918	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hearing	 understanding	 and respecting all
the different ways of thinking out there...
COOP90919	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You have to strive for that or you'll never
move forward. That's what Yukimi-san
taught me.
COOP90920	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's how I want to live my life from
now on.
COOP90921	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I have to face things	 or actually	 I WANT to
face things head-on.
COOP90922	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Maybe... that's what Papa wanted me to learn
all this time.
COOP90923	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hearing or reading stuff secondhand isn't
enough to understand something.
COOP90924	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You have to go to other places	 where your
sense of common knowledge and way of thinking
doesn't totally translate.
COOP90925	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Through experience	 through anger and tears	
he wanted me to find my own answers.
COOP90927	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You think so too	 Sensei?
COOP90928	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You're hardly the talkative type	 but you say
smart things when you do talk.
COOP90929	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ahaha	 maybe I made it sound a little
dramatic	 but I'm actually serious.
COOP90930	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Right? I feel like the Monkey King when he
finally ascends to enlightenment!
COOP90931	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I want to learn about Japan more than I ever
did before.
COOP90932	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It took me awhile	 but I think I finally see
the point of me studying here...
COOP90933	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	And it's all thanks to you	 Sensei. You'll
keep helping me out from now on	 right?
COOP90934	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	By the way	 I'm not taking no for an answer.
COOP90936	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	All right	 so first I need you to tell the
lady at the supermarket to start selling tea
in bulk already!
COOP90937	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Just kidding. Japan has its own way of doing
things. I get that now.
COOP90939	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	By the way... You really know how to attend
to an older woman	 don't you? Hehe.
COOP92002	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oooh...! This is for me...!?
COOP92003	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm so happy! I've actually wanted this for a
long time!
COOP92004	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Seriously	 thanks so much! A gift from
Sensei... It's like a dream!
COOP92005	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Huh? Is this for me?
COOP92006	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks a lot! I'm really happy.
COOP99996	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hehe... Sensei	 know any cool places we could
go? I'll leave it up to you!
COOP99997	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 that's too bad. Let's hang out some
other time!
COOP99998	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I've had my eye on that place for a while!
Great minds think alike	 huh	 Sensei?
COOP99999	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hmm... That's maybe not the best choice right
now. Any other ideas	 Sensei?
COOP92010	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Are you free today	 Sensei?
COOP92011	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I wanna learn more about Japan	 so I'm out
exploring today. Wanna come with?
COOP92013	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Awesome! I'm looking forward to learning
a lot from you!
COOP92015	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Too bad	 but no worries. Let's go some other
time	 okay?
COOP92016	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So this is your neighborhood	 huh.
COOP92017	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's so cool! It's got that "residential"
vibe if you know what I mean.
COOP92018	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Just look at all the winding side streets
crammed with niche shops! The big city can
feel suffocating sometimes.
COOP92019	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Produce stores	 restaurants... Ooh! And is
that a Japanese confectionery I see!?
COOP92020	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Those mitarashi dango are making my mouth
water! Mind if we go buy some?
COOP92022	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks! Aww	 you're always so kind to me!
COOP92023	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I guess this is your backyard	 after all. If
you insist then... okay!
COOP92024	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Hah	 you're quite the foodie	 aren't you	
Sensei? No wonder we get along.
COOP92025	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Whew! Here I thought I'd be checking out
the streets	 but turns out it was mostly
the eats...
COOP92026	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But hey	 as long as we're having fun	 right?
That's what matters.
COOP92027	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'd love if you could show me around
Zoshigaya again sometime	 Sensei.
COOP92028	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm always eager to learn more about your
neck of the woods.
COOP92035	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So this is your school	 huh	 Sensei? It's
beautiful.
COOP92036	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Nice and close to the station	 too. Although
you'd still have to dash if you forgot your
umbrella...
COOP92037	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Shimo-Kitazawa... This place's oozing with
culture! At least that's what my language
teacher said.
COOP92038	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Tons of places to eat	 too. You won't be
wanting for options on the way home!
COOP92040	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's me! Haven't you ever heard the phrase
food is culture?
COOP92041	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	A quick treat after class is what puts the
high in "high school life."
COOP92042	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 you know me so well. No snacks	 no life.
That's my motto.
COOP92043	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Now	 I'd say this is the perfect chance for
me to see one of your favorite haunts!
COOP92044	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But as curious as I am to see what a day in
the life of Sensei looks like...
COOP92045	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	All this talk of food has got my stomach
growling!
COOP92046	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm in the mood for something sweet‚Äîno wait	
a giant hamburger!
COOP92048	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There must be plenty of great spots on the
way to the station	 right? Let's go	 go	 GO!
COOP92055	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I've been curious about this place for a
while...
COOP92056	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's even more amazing than I'd imagined on
the inside.
COOP92057	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The worn corners of the altar and the
smoky stained glass tell a wonderful story
of its past.
COOP92058	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'd love to take a closer look at the statues
and equipment they use for Mass...
COOP92059	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Honestly	 though	 it's all so solemn and
dignified in here. Don't wanna get in
the way.
COOP92060	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Better to just come and soak in this space
from time to time. Doubt I'd ever tire of it.
COOP92061	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh yeah	 I heard that a pro shogi player
comes here to mull over her strategies...
COOP92062	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	You know that rumor	 Sensei? Or better yet	
have you ever met her?
COOP92064	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even though people are constantly coming
and going	 it's pretty quiet here	 so it's a
great place to think.
COOP92065	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	If you ever run into her	 tell me what she's
like! Inquiring minds want to know.
COOP92066	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I see... It's totally possible I heard wrong.
Still	 it's a cool story	 right?
COOP92067	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	A pro shogi player	 practicing in a church
to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.
COOP92068	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'll be back again soon for sure. And when I
do	 you'll come with	 won't you?
COOP92075	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ohhh! So these are the "monjayaki" I've heard
so much about!
COOP92076	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	They're totally different from what you'd
usually expect from Japanese cuisine...
COOP92077	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	They say it tastes like the kind of food they
serve at stalls during street festivals.
COOP92078	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Welp	 let's get cooking! Lessee: first	 saut√©
the dry ingredients	 creating a... donut
shape?
COOP92079	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Then	 add the remaining batter to the center
of the donut	 bring to a simmer	 then mix it
all together.
COOP92080	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Aaand we're done. Oh boy	 the smell of the
sauce alone is making my mouth water.
COOP92081	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Time to dig in! Mmm-mmh!	 now that's a unique
flavor!
COOP92082	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The mochi and cheese make every bite taste
different from the last one.
COOP92083	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	It's like anything goes if it's tasty. Kinda
screams "Japan	 if you ask me.
COOP92085,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Monjayaki kinda captures that side of Japan,
too. Don't you think, Sensei?
COOP92086,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,That was just my impression. Sounds pretty
deep when you think about it, right?
COOP92087,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,What makes a monjayaki gradually changes
over time.
COOP92089,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah! It'll burn if we keep chatting like this,
Sensei. Let's dig in!
COOP92096,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Whoaaa! We're so high up! You can see the
entire skyline of Tokyo from here!
COOP92097,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I know it's a broadcasting tower, but it's
about as tall as the skyscrapers in Shanghai.
COOP92098,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,The area around here's cool, too. They
plopped a modern marvel smack-dab in the
old district.
COOP92099,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,You've got a river, greenery, and a range of
eateries... I could never get sick of
exploring this place.
COOP92100,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Once we're done soaking in the view, where
would you recommend we go next, Sensei?
COOP92102,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ooh, so you mean the rivers around here
aren't just for show?
COOP92103,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Shinjuku and Shibuya are great, don't get me
wrong, but old Tokyo's on the east side.
COOP92104,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Along the riverside too, according to what
I've read. I'm guessing we'll be able to
see it?
COOP92105,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ahh, I've heard of that place. They say you
can see a ton of penguins inside...
COOP92106,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I wonder whether they get on well... How do
penguins even view friendship anyway?
COOP92107,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,We still haven't checked out the shop below
either. Could go look for some souvenirs...
COOP92108,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,There's no way we can see all of this in one
day, that's for sure.
COOP92109,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I think I'll be coming back here again soon.
No, you can count on it!
COOP92110,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's nice how you can see famous spots of
Tokyo you'd usually only see on maps, and
unravel their history.
COOP92117,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's always so nice around here no matter
when you come, huh? It's got such a relaxing
vibe.
COOP92118,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Yeah, I can really get a feel for Sensei's
everyday high school life here!
COOP92119,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's so quiet, and you can feel the natural
energy and stuff... It's, like... majestic,
I guess? Yeah, that's the word!
COOP92120,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It's a dish with more of a history than I
realized... You could call it Tokyo's secret
specialty, huh?
COOP92121,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Being up high is super exciting, right? I can
tell you think so too!
COOP98000,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah, Sensei. It's, uh... I know it's sudden,
but...
COOP98001,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Today, I'd really like to see what your place
is like!
COOP98003,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Really? That's okay? Thank you so much! I was
kinda nervous, but I'm glad I asked!
COOP98005,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah, I get it. That's too bad. Maybe some
other time. I'd really like to come over!
COOP98006,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hmm, I see, I see. So this is the kind of
house Sensei lives in.
COOP98007,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Considering you live alone, everything's
super neat and orderly. I'd expect no less
from Sensei, of course!
COOP98008,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Ah, as for the state of my own room... I am 
not taking any questions at this time,
got it?
COOP98009,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,After all, today we're just checking out
Sensei's room, and...
COOP98010,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Having some tea!
COOP98011,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hehe. This is a super-fancy craft tea I
bought. I hoped we could try it together,
Sensei!
COOP98012,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,...The flowers should be blooming now. Now,
please... partake? Enjoy? What do people
usually say here?
COOP98014,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I know, right? Whoever came up with this
must've been a genius, don't you think?
COOP98015,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,With all of the flowers floating around, you
can really enjoy this tea before you even
take the first sip.
COOP98016,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Totally! I don't know all the details, but...
COOP98017,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,It seems they take the tea leaves, wrap them
around the dried flowers, and tie them all by
hand one by one... I think!
COOP98018,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Here you go, Sensei, enjoy it while it's hot!
COOP98019,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,After we finish this one, we can try the
jasmine and peony flowers next. Well, enjoy!
COOP98021,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hehe. I brought something special for you to
try, Sensei.
COOP100000,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,......
COOP100001,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, {NAME2}... Sorry, I was chewin' on
an idea...
COOP100002,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, but since you're here...
COOP100003,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Totally out of the blue, I know, but are you
hungry right now?
COOP100005,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Perfect. There's something I wanna talk to
you about.
COOP100006,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,This isn't the place for it, though. Let's
head on over to Ogikubo.
COOP100007,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Okay, no worries. Sorry to keep you.
COOP100008,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've been wantin' to try this ramen shop for
forever now.
COOP100009,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's your classic Chinese-style ramen.
COOP100010,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I dunno about you, but when I hear
old-fashioned ramen	 this is what comes
to mind.
COOP100011,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, eat up. Your bowl's on me. Let's talk
after it comes.
COOP100013,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Let's eat.
COOP100014,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Whew, well, that hit the spot.
COOP100015,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The broth had that dashi taste with hints of
seafood you can find in pretty much every
Japanese dish...
COOP100016,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,...but the intentional, uneven thickness of
the noodles gave the dish a unique texture
and brought it all together.
COOP100018,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, sorry. I just blurted out what I was
thinkin'.
COOP100019,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, right. When I get lost in thought, I lose
track of what's goin' on around me.
COOP100020,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I wanna open a ramen shop in the future.
A place that serves my ideal bowl of ramen.
COOP100021,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But what flavors do I think are best? The
more I think about it, the more I don't
know...
COOP100022,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If I remember right, {NAME2}, aren't your
parents traveling now?
COOP100023,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Does that mean you usually eat alone?
COOP100024,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If it's okay with you, could you help me find
my ideal flavors ?
COOP100025,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Whenever you've got time or your stomach's
gettin' grumbly is fine. We'd just follow my
nose...
COOP100026,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Then I'd ask you a question or two. You just
have to tell me what you think.
COOP100027,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Easy enough, right? And I'll even treat you
for your trouble!
COOP100029,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Good question... I know it sounds strange for
me to say it, but I'm a bit of a contrarian.
COOP100030,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,You're kind of the only one I can ask to do
this. Plus, I'm a bit of a contrarian.
COOP100031,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I don't need nuanced responses. Just tell me
if you think it's good or not.
COOP100032,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've been told by Pops a number of times
I have to listen to other people's opinions
more.
COOP100033,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But if I'm going to get the same opinion,
I should get it from someone I can trust,
right?
COOP100034,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I thought at least you wouldn't be weird with
me and have a flexible enough schedule.
COOP100035,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I thought you'd have a flexible enough
schedule.
COOP100036,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Please? How about I broach it this way... You
cook for yourself sometimes, right?
COOP100037,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'll even teach you some easy-to-make and
tasty recipes. How's that sound?
COOP100039,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I owe you big time!
COOP100040,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, I'm still on a high schooler's budget,
so go easy on me, okay?
COOP100041,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Yeah I am. No way am I lettin' you pay.
COOP100042,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I need to recoup all the time I lost doin'
this on my own. I'm definitely gonna find my
ideal flavors.
COOP100045,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, as promised, I'll teach you a recipe.
But we should leave now that we're done
eating.
COOP100200,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,......
COOP100201,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, {NAME2}! Perfect timing.
COOP100202,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm off to try somethin' new. You comin'?
COOP100204,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That settles it then.
COOP100205,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's a bit far, but I'm headin' to
Tsukishima. A place there caught my eye.
Let's go.
COOP100206,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I see... Well, maybe next time, then.
COOP100207,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Man, it feels like forever since the last
time I came to a monjayaki place like this...
COOP100209,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Nah, we're after ramen, remember?
COOP100210,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Don't you worry. We'll be slurpin' down some
noodles.
COOP100211,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,You're a regular? Then did you know about the
side menu here?
COOP100212,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sometimes you can find restaurants where the
sides are as popular as their signature dish.
COOP100213,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The ramen at this restaurant is excellent,
or so I've heard.
COOP100214,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That said... it doesn't feel right to come
to a monjayaki restaurant and not order
monjayaki.
COOP100215,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,We're gonna be eatin' ramen after this, so I
got us an order of the simplest one to split.
COOP100216,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I can go ahead and grill this bad boy up for
us, if that's okay with you.
COOP100217,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,All right. Here goes nothing.
COOP100218,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sorry, {NAME2}. I got in the zone. You see
this crater-lookin' space in the middle?
COOP100219,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,That's where you pour the rest of the batter
still in the bowl. You can do the honors.
COOP100220,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've heard some people like to dump half in
first, but let's just do my favorite: goin'
all in.
COOP100221,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,All right. Shall we? I'm starving.
COOP100222,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm getting a dashi base with a hint of tea
leaves in the batter. This flavor...
Very nice.
COOP100223,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It gives the dashi a lighter taste that won't
overpower any later add-ins like sauce or
seaweed flakes.
COOP100224,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,This restaurant balances high-quality food
without sacrificin' chances to bring in a bit
more money with extra toppings.
COOP100226,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If I'm already blabberin' this much, the
ramen is probably gonna be out of this world.
COOP100227,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Totally. I haven't forgotten. Let's move on
to the main event.
COOP100228,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I'm tempted, but we've gotta leave room for
the ramen.
COOP100229,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Here it is... The miso butter corn ramen.
COOP100230,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The regulars here refer to it as the secret
signature dish.
COOP100231,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Let's dig in!
COOP100232,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Unbelievable!
COOP100233,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, uh, sorry. It's just that this ramen is
outrageously good!
COOP100234,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,They probably used the same dashi that was in
the monjayaki. The tea leaf flavor gives it
away.
COOP100235,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,What's amazing is that it still retains its
unique taste despite the strength of the
miso.
COOP100236,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,[Redacted]
COOP100237,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It goes well with both the noodles and
corn. Versatile... A vague but accurate
description.
COOP100238,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,[Redacted]
COOP100239,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,The dashi is so perfect that it can both stay
as it is or become anything else...
COOP100240,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,If a monjayaki restaurant is this good,
a shop specializing in ramen has big shoes
to fill.
COOP100241,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,[Redacted]
COOP100242,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I felt the same when I tried the ramen in
Ogikubo, but I think character is key here.
COOP100243,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Ramen with character... What would my unique
spin on it would be...?
COOP100245,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,My obsession with the broth, huh...?
COOP100246,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Stickin' to the basics, huh...?
COOP100247,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I think Pops said somethin' similar. That I
can't slack off when it comes to even a basic
ramen broth.
COOP100248,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,A ramen with a focus on its dashi... Yeah,
that's exactly what I'm aimin' for.
COOP100249,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Come to think of it, I can't do anythin'
other than what Pops taught me.
COOP100250,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I was so overwhelmed by the flavors of this
place that I almost missed that...
COOP100251,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Thanks, {NAME2}.
COOP100253,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Shoot, the monjayaki is burnin'! And the
noodles are gonna lose their bounce. Let's
finish eatin' quick!
COOP100300,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,......
COOP100301,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, {NAME2}. I'm off to try somethin' new.
You comin'?
COOP100303,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Well, then, that's perfect.
COOP100304,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But before we go... I wanna pick your brain
a bit.
COOP100305,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Gotcha. Let's go another time.
COOP100306,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,You remember that monjayaki joint, right?
It made me think about runnin' a business.
COOP100307,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I think the best time to eat ramen is when
it's been freshly made...
COOP100308,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I mean, who in their right mind wants to eat
takeout ramen? Am I right?
COOP100310,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Good point. Maybe I'm just pickier than
most...
COOP100311,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh yeah, you've got a point there.
COOP100312,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Anyway, I decided to try out a takeout spot
I've been scoping for a while now.
COOP100313,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Smartphones are crazy, huh? You can just
phone 'em up and grab your food when
it's done.
COOP100314,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Here it is. The soupless tantanmen that
everyone's been buzzin' about.
COOP100315,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's a type of ramen called mixed noodles."
Basically	 you mix the noodles yourself with
the sauce below them.
COOP100316	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 let's eat. Oh	 uh	 you gotta really go
to town when mixin' it	 okay?
COOP100317	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	IT BUUURRRNNNSSS!
COOP100318	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What the hell!? My tongue is on fire! Are you
okay	 man!?
COOP100319	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I think I added too much chili paste. It did
say "to taste" on the packet...
COOP100320	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 {NAME2}. I'm kinda ashamed.
COOP100322	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm ashamed of my short-sightedness.
COOP100323	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	To be honest	 I didn't think this could hold
a candle to the monjayaki place. But I was
wrong.
COOP100324	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 no	 it has nothing to do with me addin'
too much chili paste.
COOP100325	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I underestimated what takeout could be.
I thought it was just a worse version of
restaurant food.
COOP100326	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But hey	 just look at these noodles.
COOP100327	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They're springy and made to be enjoyed cool.
It gives 'em this texture that won't quit
even if they're not eaten immediately.
COOP100328	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There are even reasons for the lack of soup:
it prevents spillage during transport and
keeps the noodles from absorbing it.
COOP100329	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But it's a shame. The texture would be better
if the ingredients were cut larger...
COOP100330	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 wait. They've taken that into
consideration too!
COOP100331	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah	 sorry for yelling out of nowhere. But
hey	 look.
COOP100332	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The ingredients are finer than the ones
served in restaurants	 so it's easier to mix.
COOP100333	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Customers pressed for time opt for takeout.
They don't have the time to sit down and eat
in a relaxed place.
COOP100334	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's quick to mix and quick to eat. The
ingredients are small on purpose.
COOP100335	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Takeout's delicious even when cold. It
reminds me of the packed lunches my mom
would make...
COOP100336	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 hey	 sorry about that. My mouth got away
from me all of a sudden.
COOP100337	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Now I just eat whatever I want	 but I used
to bring lunch from home back in middle
school.
COOP100338	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My mom was a nurse and sometimes had to work
the graveyard shift.
COOP100339	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But she still prepared my lunch for school
each and every day.
COOP100340	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That was absolutely delicious.
COOP100341	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 {NAME2}. I think I was a bit na√Øve
about this.
COOP100342	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I never really thought about it before	 but
you can see the hard work people put into the
food you eat every day.
COOP100343	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The more I'm tryin' to level up my palate
with you	 the more I realize how amazin'
food is.
COOP100345	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah... I've realized that	 as a chef	
I still have a long way to go.
COOP100346	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh?
COOP100347	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hmph... I guess even being able to make that
realization shows I've grown a bit.
COOP100348	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100349	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Heck no	 I'm not about to give up now. I'll
do whatever it takes to become a chef of
that caliber!
COOP100350	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's like you said. This is no time to be
gettin' so down.
COOP100351	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And the same applies to you	 too. I'm not the
only one on this journey anymore.
COOP100353	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Do your lips feel a bit tingly? It must be...
the... Japanese pepper... kickin' in...
COOP100354	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I need some tea... But before that...
COOP100400	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100401	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 {NAME2}. I'm off to try somethin' new.
You comin'?
COOP100403	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's perfect	 then.
COOP100404	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There's something at that spot in Ogikubo
from before that's caught my eye.
COOP100405	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Nice. They still have what I'm looking for.
Let's go.
COOP100406	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No worries... Well	 next time then.
COOP100407	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This place sometimes offers a special ramen
for a limited time only.
COOP100408	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's announced the day of	 and they only make
so many bowls	 so it's hard to get.
COOP100409	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They just happened to be doin' it today	
so it looks like we're in luck.
COOP100410	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And here it is. The curry ramen set meal.
COOP100411	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's a popular kind of ramen in Niigata. That
must be where they got the inspo for this.
COOP100412	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Look	 it comes with rice and pickled veggies
too. What a great deal.
COOP100414	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I mean	 curry udon is a thing	 so it's not as
unusual as it is rare.
COOP100415	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Me neither. I've never had it at a restaurant
before.
COOP100416	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Good point. It is a lot of food... You did
say you were hungry	 though!
COOP100417	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Plus it's gonna taste like curry	 so I'm sure
it won't disappoint. Let's dig in.
COOP100418	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 right! Don't slurp too fast or you'll get
covered in curry.
COOP100419	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	When it comes to what I imagined curry ramen
to be...
COOP100420	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	...this is anythin' but!
COOP100421	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They used the soup from the shoyu ramen we
had before to thin out the curry.
COOP100422	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do you think of the harmony of the broth
and noodle thickness? They must make the roux
from scratch!
COOP100423	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Do you know how?
COOP100425	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	How to make a curry roux from scratch. Most
people use store-bought products	 yeah?
COOP100426	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 sorry. When I get absorbed in something	
I forget what's goin' on around me.
COOP100427	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 right. I was talkin' about curry roux	
wasn't I?
COOP100428	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh yeah? No problem then. If you're PSYCHIC.
COOP100429	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But we're talkin' about how to make a curry
roux here.
COOP100430	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Making one takes lot of time and effort. You
gotta fry the flour in butter slowly	 so it
doesn't burn.
COOP100431	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I bet this place prepares the regular menu at
the same time. When does the chef find time
to sleep?
COOP100432	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What a feast that was. Let's get outta here.
COOP100433	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh... right. It's crazy to think that there's
even more where that came from.
COOP100434	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Put this in too. Noodles are good and all	
but with curry you gotta have rice as well.
COOP100435	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 that hit the spot! Curry is way	 way
better with a side of rice.
COOP100436	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I guess the chef knows that as well and
that's why they made it into a set meal.
COOP100437	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ahhh	 I'm stuffed! What a satisfyin' meal
that was.
COOP100438	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It tasted great and all	 but they really made
sure that you enjoy each and every bite.
COOP100439	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's customer consideration for you... You
get so much outta a single bowl.
COOP100440	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Consideration...
COOP100441	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ahh...
COOP100442	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I remember once when I was a kid	 I was
havin' ramen with my dad at home...
COOP100443	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	At the time	 somethin' or other always had
my attention	 so I didn't have much of an
appetite.
COOP100444	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Outta nowhere	 my dad poured curry into my
ramen.
COOP100445	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Bein' a child and all	 I thought I had upset
him somehow.
COOP100446	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I mean	 he was never really a talkative guy	
nor was he around much at home with his job
as a truck driver...
COOP100447	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But now I think maybe he'd had it in Niigata
and thought I should try it.
COOP100448	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 there's no way to know now	 since
he's gone.
COOP100449	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Like I said before	 my parents are divorced
and I now live with my mom.
COOP100450	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I wanna open a ramen shop	 but I also want to
make my mom's life easier...
COOP100451	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sorry. I know this has nothing to do with our
search for my ideal flavors.
COOP100453	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks	 {NAME2}.
COOP100454	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	D-Does it? I mean	 doesn't everybody care
about their mom?
COOP100455	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Quit bein' all weird and pointin' it out like
that	 man	 haha.
COOP100457	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh no!
COOP100458	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Dang it	 I got curry on my pants! My mom will
have my head if she sees it!
COOP100460	Eleg<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nt Wo<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>an	I see... So that boy is Shun Kano. He looks
like he has a promising future ahead of him.
COOP100500	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100501	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 {NAME2}. I'm off to try somethin' new.
You comin'?
COOP100503	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Good to hear.
COOP100504	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We're hittin' up a diner today. I heard they
just started a collab menu with another
big-name restaurant.
COOP100505	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They're doin' it at all locations	 so we'll
go to the Shibuya branch since it's closest.
COOP100506	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 okay... Another time then.
COOP100507	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yep	 yep. That's what it looks like. The
shop's spicy tsukemen.
COOP100508	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The red one's got chili peppers and fish
powder in it. Fish powder is basically ground
up dried fish.
COOP100509	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Dissolve it as much as you want in the sauce
and then dip the noodles in it before eating.
COOP100510	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I've had this tsukemen at the main chain.
It's one of my personal favorites.
COOP100511	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I wonder what led them to collaboratin' with
this diner chain... Time to find out.
COOP100512	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What a great meal. I see now. That's what it
was all about...
COOP100514	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I think they've taken a different approach
with the tsukemen from the one they've done
before.
COOP100515	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sorry	 I mean they've added unique touches
that you'd only find at a diner.
COOP100516	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 you finished yours too? Pretty tasty	
yeah?
COOP100517	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The noodles are thinner than at the main
restaurant and boiled to be a little softer.
COOP100518	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They changed the fish powder mix and even
lowered the spice to suit the family-friendly
setting.
COOP100519	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They're tryin' to reach more customers
while still maintaining their signature
spicy-but-oh-so-good taste.
COOP100520	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The order of operation has also been very
carefully thought out.
COOP100521	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They've changed the production process
so that even inexperienced line cooks
can make it.
COOP100522	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Effort leads to labor costs	 which are hard
to avoid if you want to maintain the flavor.
COOP100523	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But just because you've perfected somethin'
doesn't mean it can't still be just as good
in another form.
COOP100524	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Of course	 that's easier said than done...
COOP100525	E<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>egant W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	I can't believe that a single bowl could
reveal so much...
COOP100526	E<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>egant Woman	You're truly one of a kind	 aren't you	
Shun Kano-kun?
COOP100527	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And you are?
COOP100528	Eleg<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nt Wo<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>an	My apologies. The name is <color=#FF423F>Takumi Serizawa</color>.
COOP100529	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I was just thinking of dropping by to chat
with you tomorrow. But it looks like fate had
other plans	 hm?
COOP100530	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're a food consultant!? For one of the
biggest companies out there!?
COOP100532	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's more than a big deal!
COOP100533	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You have no idea!
COOP100534	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Everyone in the food industry knows her
company. They're the cream of the crop.
COOP100535	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And she's a food consultant for them!
COOP100536	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She develops recipes	 plans events	 and is	
like	 one of the truest culinary
professionals!
COOP100537	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Such high praise. Why	 thank you.
COOP100538	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What interest would someone like you possibly
have in me?
COOP100539	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	We're in the process of planning a major
ramen-themed event called Ramen Promenade 2.
COOP100540	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Kano-kun	 how would you feel if I asked you
to enter the competition with a ramen of
your own?
COOP100541	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ramen Promenade is a big ramen event
featurin' famous ramen shops from all over.
COOP100542	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What business would I have bein' there?
COOP100543	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I saw the Food Fight video. You caught my eye
with how you were able to impress Miyazawa.
COOP100568	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Well... News travels fast. Like news of how
you managed to whip up a bowl that left a
certain someone lost for words.
COOP100544	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Naturally	 in the event that you win the
competition	 you will be handsomely rewarded.
COOP100545	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A reward	 huh?
COOP100546	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	So? What do you think?
COOP100547	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My mom...
COOP100548	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do you think	 {NAME2}?
COOP100550	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I... I'll...
COOP100551	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. You're right. It's my decision to make.
I'll...
COOP100552	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It'll make things easier for my mom... It's
also a way to give myself more credibility as
a chef.
COOP100553	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll do it.
COOP100554	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Hehe	 that should make for an interesting
competition this time around.
COOP100555	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	The event's theme is "ramen that will be
forever loved by one and all."
COOP100556	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ramen that'll be loved by everyone	 huh...?
So more traditional ramen then?
COOP100557	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Not exactly. It's a world-class event	 so a
degree of innovation will be required.
COOP100558	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Please do contact me when you've decided on
your ramen... I'll be waiting.
COOP100559	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's kinda lame	 but I was honestly really
rattled by what Serizawa-san said earlier.
COOP100560	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I'll get paid if I win the competition	
so I'll just have to swallow my doubts as
best I can.
COOP100561	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's all thanks to you givin' me the push I
needed.
COOP100562	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks	 man.
COOP100564	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I feel like I get the theme. I mean	 what's
not to love about ramen? But how would I
spice it up?
COOP100565	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I still don't know what flavors I think are
best... I have so much work to do.
COOP100566	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But let's not put the cart before the horse.
Here ya go	 as promised	 {NAME2}.
COOP100600	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100601	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 {NAME2}. Wanna grab a bite? I'd like
you to try something.
COOP100603	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's perfect	 then.
COOP100604	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I've finished a prototype to enter for the
competition menu. I'd like to hear your
thoughts on it.
COOP100605	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll put on the finishin' touches	 so just
hang on one more sec.
COOP100606	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 okay... Another time then.
COOP100607	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This is it. I call it the ramenburger.
COOP100608	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's freshly made. I prepared it at home and
just finished it in the home ec room.
COOP100609	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I got permission to use the room first	
of course.
COOP100610	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ramen's a pretty handy pick when you wanna
eat out	 but you can't exactly eat it on the
go	 can you?
COOP100611	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But what if you could? Wouldn't that make
people happy?
COOP100612	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Both ramen and hamburgers are restaurant
staples that fit that theme of "loved by one
and all" to a T.
COOP100613	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then by combinin' the two	 I can give ramen
that element of innovation they're lookin'
for.
COOP100614	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm thinkin' of goin' with this	 but what do
you think	 {NAME2}?
COOP100615	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I know. That's the most important thing.
I don't think you can win with impact alone.
COOP100616	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	C'mon	 have a little faith in me. The only
thing weird about it is how it looks.
COOP100617	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We've been tryin' tons of new foods	 right?
I based this on all of those times together.
COOP100618	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I aimed for a dish that has a tasty broth
but also tastes good even when not
pipin' hot.
COOP100619	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Agh	 but this is takin' too long to explain.
Hurry up and give it a try.
COOP100620	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well? Feel free to be brutally honest with
your feedback.
COOP100622	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You like the taste	 but it just doesn't quite
hit the spot	 huh?
COOP100623	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You like the idea	 but it just doesn't quite
hit the spot	 huh?
COOP100624	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks for the honest feedback. I really
appreciate it.
COOP100625	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	To tell you the truth	 I kinda feel the same.
COOP100626	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I packed it with all the ingenuity
I could muster. And I think the flavors
aren't too shabby.
COOP100627	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do you think is the biggest problem with
it	 {NAME2}?
COOP100629	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's possible that the visual impact could
overshadow the actual taste...
COOP100630	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You mean what kind of people do I want to
eat it...? That's a good point.
COOP100631	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	As I said before	 I feel like I get the theme
more or less.
COOP100632	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My issue is innovation. What makes any one
food "innovative" anyway?
COOP100633	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This was very helpful. I'm glad I asked for
advice sooner than later.
COOP100634	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll try to improve it further by focusing on
what you said	 {NAME2}.
COOP100635	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And then I'll present it to the world's most
prestigious food consultant!
COOP100636	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm definitely fired up to give this my all.
COOP100637	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I mean	 me even gettin' to enter the
competition was a bit of a windfall in
itself.
COOP100639	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Now that that's outta the way	 I am a man of
my word	 so...
COOP100641	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 d'you still have time? Could you help me
clean the home economics room?
COOP100642	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	When I got permission to use it	 it was on
the condition that I would clean it after	
but like...
COOP100700	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100701	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 {NAME2}.
COOP100702	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Perfect timing. I was thinkin' of meetin'
with Serizawa-san to talk about the
competition...
COOP100703	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I wanted you to try my ramenburger 2.0
first...
COOP100704	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So {NAME2}	 will you indulge me?
COOP100706	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's a relief. Thanks. Let's go meet her
right away.
COOP100707	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I see. I guess that's the way it goes. Maybe you
can help next time then...
COOP100708	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I guess this means today is the official
unveiling of Kano-kun's competition entry?
COOP100709	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Well then	 what do you have for me?
COOP100710	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Should I plate it here?
COOP100711	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is the restaurant not open	 or...?
COOP100712	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Don't worry	 this is nothing new. We do
tastings of novel menu items here all the
time.
COOP100713	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	We've made sure that no customers will be
allowed in until we are finished here.
COOP100714	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay. In that case...
COOP100715	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I give you the ramenburger. A dish that
combines inspiration with likability.
COOP100716	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's gone through several revisions	 but
I think it's finally ready for you. Please	
try it and give me your honest opinion.
COOP100717	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	A ramen... burger...?
COOP100718	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Hmm	 I think I see where you're going with
this...
COOP100719	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Let's have a bite then	 shall we?
COOP100720	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well...?
COOP100721	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	It's delicious	 and I'd definitely say that
it gets an A+ for originality.
COOP100722	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	It's the perfect menu item to grab people's
attention and get them interested.
COOP100723	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right on!
COOP100724	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	That said	 this isn't really what I was
looking for this time.
COOP100725	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Maybe my explanation was inadequate.
Apologies if that was the case.
COOP100726	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	This year's theme is "ramen to be loved
forever by one and all." In other words...
COOP100727	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Ramen that has the potential to become a new
standard.
COOP100728	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	When I said "innovative	 I didn't mean
something strange and unconventional.
COOP100729,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Oh, I see...
COOP100731,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,It's been botherin' me for a long time,
wonderin' what you meant by innovation."
COOP100732	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 you did say that in your feedback	
didn't you?
COOP100733	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe I was swayed too much by the need to
be "innovative."
COOP100734	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Perhaps. But it looks like you've figured
it out...
COOP100735	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I'm looking for something probably closer to
what you're pursuing on a daily basis.
COOP100736	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Don't lose sight of who YOU are and try to
use tricks just to grab people's attention.
COOP100737	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Now... I'd like to ask your friend something.
COOP100738	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	You're the one who went to the ramen shop in
Ogikubo with Kano-kun	 right?
COOP100739	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Have you been going around with him to
check out the flavors of foods at other
restaurants?
COOP100741	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I see. It all makes sense now.
COOP100742	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I had a hunch	 but it appears that I was
right after all.
COOP100743	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Heh	 that's cute. It all makes sense now.
COOP100744	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I don't want you to take this the wrong
way...
COOP100745	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I'm not saying there isn't any value in this
ramenburger.
COOP100746	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I can tell this is the culmination of your
research together and that you put a ton of
thought into the flavors and textures.
COOP100747	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	And I don't think the idea of eating ramen on
the go is bad at all.
COOP100748	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	But that doesn't mean you can overlook the
forever loved part of the theme.
COOP100749	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Kano-kun	 you studied under Yamagoshi-san of
Heritage Kitchen	 right?
COOP100750	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Don't you want to become the type of ramen
chef who's always striving...
COOP100751	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	...striving to one-up himself with each bowl
he gives to a customer?
COOP100752	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You've pegged me pretty well... But I‚Äî
COOP100753	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Instead of trying to snag a win with a wild
idea	 I'd rather you give us an entry that
shows us what you've learned.
COOP100754	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	That's all I have to say for now.
COOP100755	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Our doors are always open. Please do get in
touch if you'd like to give it another try.
COOP100756	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Now then	 I won't take anymore of your
time...
COOP100757	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So to sum that all up... I failed completely.
COOP100758	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I didn't understand anything about the
competition theme or the food consultant.
COOP100759	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It definitely wasn't my intention to come off
like I wasn't takin' this thing seriously.
COOP100760	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I'm not just gonna pack it in after that.
COOP100761	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She made her offer after findin' out all
about me. There's no way I can back out now.
COOP100763	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Next time	 I'll definitely show her what I
can do!
COOP100764	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	She might've. I'm not the best at bein'
introspective after all.
COOP100765	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I know I'm talkin' like I'm gonna do this on
my own	 but I'll need your help with this.
COOP100766	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So yeah	 time for me to buckle down. Today
marks the start of another round of recipe
testing.
COOP100767	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You'll be the first to get to taste the best
ones	 so get your taste buds ready for a trip
to Flavor Town.
COOP100769	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But before I head off	 I've gotta keep the
promise I made to you.
COOP100800	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100801	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 it's you	 {NAME2}.
COOP100802	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm at a dead end with my recipe ideas for
the competition. Figured I could use a break.
COOP100804	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 let's have some fun and go get some
chow.
COOP100805	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	At times like this	 familiar flavors are
best. But where would we go for that...?
COOP100807	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Just what I had in mind.
COOP100808	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And your house is in Zoshigaya too	 so it's
perfect.
COOP100809	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	'Kay. When you've got time	 then.
COOP100810	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hmm...
COOP100811	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I've been eatin' a lot of noodles lately	
so I think I'll have somethin' other than
ramen.
COOP100812	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll go for the fried rice. How about you?
COOP100814	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There you go. Scuse me	 two servings of
fried rice	 please.
COOP100815	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's not tasty at Heritage Kitchen	 right?
Scuse me	 two servings of fried rice	 please.
COOP100816	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wh-Why not? I don't solely subsist on ramen	
y'know!
COOP100817	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Plus	 we're doin' this for a change of pace	
right? Scuse me	 two servings of fried rice	
please.
COOP100818	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	Comin' right up!
COOP100819	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops seems to be feelin' a lot better. He's
in the kitchen about once a week now.
COOP100821	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gular	How's it hangin'	 chief? Can you get me an
order of fried rice?
COOP100822	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>gular	Hey	 it's Shun-kun! I haven't seen you around
much lately. All good?
COOP100823	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shige-san! Yeah	 I'm doin' good. You seem
pretty well yourself.
COOP100824	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	Haha	 age is still takin' a number on me	
but that won't stop me from comin' here all
the time.
COOP100825	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I guess people really do love Heritage
Kitchen	 huh?
COOP100826	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	Here ya go. Hope I didn't keep ya waitin'
too long.
COOP100827	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This is it. It's like every grain of rice has
been cooked to perfection.
COOP100828	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I love that Heritage Kitchen's fried rice
always has this great fluffiness to it.
COOP100829	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	Mmm	 I can't get enough of how spongy the
rice tastes. Chef	 have you improved your
cooking?
COOP100830	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What the heck is he talkin' about?
COOP100831	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All right.
COOP100832	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Umm... Sorry	 mind if I take a bite of that
fried rice you got there?
COOP100833	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I haven't used my spoon yet	 so...
COOP100834	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	Huh!? Uh	 I mean I guess you can have
one bite.
COOP100835	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You weren't kiddin'! This really is moist...
COOP100837	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't know	 either. But maybe...
COOP100838	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 this is no mistake. But maybe	 just
maybe...
COOP100839	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No	 there is only one type of fried rice on
the menu at Heritage Kitchen...
COOP100840	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	Oh	 about that... I only really do it for
regulars	 but...
COOP100841	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	I observe how the person is feeling and
adjust the seasoning accordingly.
COOP100842	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	Shige-san looked a little tired when he
came in.
COOP100843	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	So I put a bit more lard and salt in his
fried rice	 which is what gives it that
moisture.
COOP100844	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	What!? Really!? Your attention to detail is
absolutely amazing	 Chef.
COOP100845	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	I hadn't the slightest idea.
COOP100846	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	By the way	 you and your friend's servings
have less lard in them	 Shun.
COOP100847	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	You were saying you've been eating a lot of
noodles and wanted a change of pace	 right?
COOP100848	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	So I thought you'd like to eat something
light and dry with little liquid.
COOP100849	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's true. It's only a slight difference	
but it seems a bit fluffier than usual...
COOP100850	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I can't stop eatin' it!
COOP100851	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	Just know that I only do this for familiar
faces	 got it?
COOP100852	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	I don't want everyone thinkin' this place has
some nosy creep runnin' it.
COOP100853	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	So don't go tellin' folks about this	 okay?
COOP100854	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops	 Shige-san	 thanks a ton for today.
Hey... {NAME2}	 I think I get it now.
COOP100856	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm glad we came here today.
COOP100857	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I wouldn't have made this discovery if you
didn't hang out with me today	 {NAME2}.
COOP100858	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The hint I needed for a taste that will be
forever loved by one and all...
COOP100859	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The theme! The hint I needed for a taste that
will be forever loved by one and all...
COOP100860	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	...was in the fried rice Pops made!
COOP100861	Y<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>magoshi-san	It was? I don't really get how	 but I'm happy
I could help you at least.
COOP100862	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	Yeah	 I don't really eith‚Äînoooo!!!
COOP100863	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	I shared my fried rice with Shun	 so I wanted
to get a bite of his as well...
COOP100864	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ige-san	But it looks like SOMEONE's already cleaned
his plate.
COOP100865	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah... Sorry. It was just the right amount of
fluffiness	 so I kinda...
COOP100866	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I think {NAME2}'s still got some! Would
you mind givin' some to Shige-san?
COOP100867	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	My bad. Thanks for sharin' yours!
COOP100868	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Even Pops is givin' it his all day in and day
out. I need to do the same.
COOP100870	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But first	 I still need to honor that promise
I made with you.
COOP100900	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100901	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 there you are	 {NAME2}.
COOP100902	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm thinking of meeting with Serizawa-san
today. I've finished my new entry for the
competition.
COOP100903	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wanna join me for her review of it?
COOP100905	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Great! Let's get goin' then!
COOP100906	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Gotcha. Oh well. Let's do it another
day then.
COOP100907	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I am very glad to see that you're still keen
on giving this another try.
COOP100908	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I graciously accept your rematch.
COOP100909	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm glad too. Please give me your true
assessment; I'll take it in stride. Today I
give you an absolute classic.
COOP100910	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Well... At first glance	 it looks like a
run-of-the-mill shoyu ramen.
COOP100911	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	How promising. Let's have a taste then.
COOP100912	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I can tell you used dashi in the soy sauce
broth. The taste somewhat reminds me of the
ramen from Victory Kitchen.
COOP100913	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	It's robust	 yet evokes that mainstream shoyu
ramen flavor.
COOP100914	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yes	 exactly. I don't believe I could've made
an entry like this any other way.
COOP100915	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	It's very delicious. However	 this alone is‚Äî
COOP100916	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hold on a second.
COOP100917	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Here's the second ramen.
COOP100918	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	What do you mean? Isn't this the same as the
one before?
COOP100919	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No. Just give it a try and you'll understand.
COOP100920	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Okay then. Here goes nothing.
COOP100921	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	The base flavor is the same as the previous
ramen... But this one is totally different in
terms of richness!
COOP100922	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I made both of these bowls with almost
identical ingredients and using the same
method.
COOP100923	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The difference lies in the lard and roasted
garlic I added at the end	 and the saltiness
of the broth...
COOP100924	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This second bowl of ramen was created by
making gradual adjustments in a bid for a
vastly different finish.
COOP100925	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	So	 Kano-kun... This means your entry for
today is...
COOP100926	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You guessed it. It's ramen that can be
adjusted to suit the state of the person
eatin' it.
COOP100928	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 our quest to develop my palate and
Pops's fried rice gave me the idea.
COOP100929	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yup	 Pops's treatment of his customers
inspired this ramen.
COOP100930	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh... Sorry. I don't have any more to share
with you. But I'll make more	 so bear with me
till then.
COOP100931	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What people want to eat changes dependin' on
their mood	 their health	 the weather	 and a
bunch of other stuff.
COOP100932	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	However	 addin' seasonings to taste could
result in a less high-quality dish.
COOP100933	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And there are limits to what a chef can do on
intuition alone.
COOP100934	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Even Pops said he can't do it for anyone
other than regulars.
COOP100935	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So I thought maybe some custom patterns would
do the trick.
COOP100936	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Y'know	 find some finishes beforehand that
still let a chef guarantee it'll taste good.
COOP100937	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	One for cold days	 or one when a customer's
sleepy... A variation for every occasion.
COOP100938	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Here is a list of the different combinations.
COOP100939	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	By following the listed amounts and steps	
the same taste can be recreated at any store.
COOP100940	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I see. So	 in other words...
COOP100941	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	A base ramen and a list of adjustments.
This is the entry you're proposing	 then	
Kano-kun?
COOP100942	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	...Magnificent.
COOP100943	Takumi Seri<#000000	z	#FFFFFF>awa	In addition to a firm grasp of basic flavors	
you're able to creatively tailor dishes to
fit individual customers...
COOP100944	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I'd say you've achieved the theme of "ramen
that will be forever loved by one and all"
with flying colors.
COOP100945	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	This is definitely a worthy submission. I'm
looking forward to seeing how it fares in the
competition.
COOP100947	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks... Gettin' Serizawa's approval means
the world to me!
COOP100948	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks	 you know I won't. I'm gonna keep
tweakin' this until the day of the comp.
COOP100949	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	O-Oh. Were you really that hungry?
COOP100950	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay	 okay. I came up with a combo for when
you're starvin'	 so I'll whip a bowl up for
you later.
COOP100951	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I would also like to apologize for my earlier
remarks about the ramenburger.
COOP100952	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I only said those things because I wanted you
to rise to the challenge as a chef of your
own making.
COOP100953	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Can I ask you something?
COOP100954	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Why did you go out of your way to give so
much advice to an exhibitor like myself?
COOP100955	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You even knew that I had trained at Victory
Kitchen and was tryin' to develop my palate
with {NAME2}...
COOP100956	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Yes	 well... I suppose we can talk about this
now that I have finished reviewing your
entry.
COOP100957	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I think it was due to the professional
approach you take to food.
COOP100958	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Truth be told	 my father was also a chef.
COOP100959	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	He was a clumsy and blunt man who always
struggled to communicate with even me	 his
own daughter.
COOP100960	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	But more than anything	 he loved to see his
customers enjoy his food.
COOP100961	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	And I was proud of him for that.
COOP100962	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	I'm also in the restaurant business now	 but
I handle far more money each day than my
father's store ever did.
COOP100963	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	And yet	 a thought sometimes crosses my mind:
COOP100964	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Can my work bring smiles to customers' faces
like my father's did?
COOP100965	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	When I see that professional side of you	
I'm reminded of my father.
COOP100966	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	Maybe that's why I decided to support you.
COOP100967	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP100968	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	But I digress... Once again	 congratulations	
Shun Kano-kun.
COOP100969	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>kumi Serizawa	The Ramen Promenade 2 Executive Committee
welcomes your participation.
COOP100970	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I did it	 {NAME2}! Still can't believe it...
COOP100971	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	After all that work	 my ramen's gonna be
featured in Ramen Promenade 2!?
COOP100972	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I can't thank you enough. This is what all of
our hangin' out has led to.
COOP101000	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
COOP101001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 I've been waitin' for you	 {NAME2}.
COOP101002	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are you hungry right now? I've got somethin'
I want you to try.
COOP101004	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay	 hold on a sec then. I'll have it ready
in no time.
COOP101005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 okay. I'd still like you to try it some
time when you're free.
COOP101006	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sorry to keep you waitin'. I just made this
in the home ec room. Give it a try.
COOP101007	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This ramen recipe is still in development	
so it's pretty simple without any toppings
or special seasoning...
COOP101008	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I made it with you in mind. It's for you
and you only to eat.
COOP101009	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This is to make it up to you for that
other day...
COOP101010	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The one where you tagged along with me but I
didn't prepare you a bowl too.
COOP101011	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 it's not just for that. It's also to
thank you for helping me on that long journey
to find my ideal flavors.
COOP101012	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	According to Serizawa-san	 the ramen I
entered into the competition was well
received.
COOP101013	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm so relieved that I didn't end up
disappointin' her.
COOP101014	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That said	 its flavor was heavily inspired by
the ramen at Heritage Kitchen.
COOP101015	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Next time	 I want to be evaluated on the
taste of somethin' I created from scratch.
COOP101016	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So this is the first step in that journey.
COOP101017	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	While we were developing my palate	 I also
got a rough sense for your preferences.
COOP101019	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yep	 even though it's still a work in
progress	 I'm confident in it.
COOP101020	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 you'll find out after you have a taste.
COOP101021	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	N-No! The main point was to find my ideal
flavors. It just so happened I also learned
what you liked...
COOP101022	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyway... Try it first. And then let me know
what you think.
COOP101023	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So... How was it?
COOP101025	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right? You like a good aftertaste	 don't you?
I got that feelin' when I was eatin'
with you.
COOP101026	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Such high praise. Thanks for being so frank
with your feedback.
COOP101027	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You didn't even realize you finished eatin'?
What better compliment is there than that?
COOP101028	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Did you notice at all that I used two
different types of soy sauce for the base?
COOP101029	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I see... I'll take that into consideration.
COOP101030	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I still lack both knowledge and experience.
I need to keep developing my palate.
COOP101031	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If you don't mind	 I hope you'll keep lending
an ear	 {NAME2}.
COOP101033	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I thought you'd say that.
COOP101034	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Totally. I need to broaden my horizons	 or
I'll never find the flavors I'm aimin' for.
COOP101035	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This experience really opened my eyes in that
regard.
COOP101036	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Haha	 sure thing. Nobody out there's a match
for you	 {NAME2}.
COOP101037	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks in advance for helpin' out.
COOP101039	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I have an idea for the next place already	
but first I have to fulfill my promise.
COOP109002	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Th-This is...!
COOP109003	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are you really sure I can have this!? I've
wanted it so bad!
COOP109004	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thank you. I owe you one!
COOP109005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh!? Are you sure...?
COOP109006	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I appreciate it. You didn't have to go out of
your way.
COOP108900	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 {NAME2}. You hungry?
COOP108901	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm off to try somethin' new to develop my
palate. Wanna tag along?
COOP108903	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Cool. Let's get going then.
COOP108905	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	'Kay. Maybe some other time.
COOP109012	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Th-This is...!
COOP109013	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are you really sure I can have this!? I've
wanted it so bad!
COOP109014	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thank you. I owe you one!
COOP109015	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh!? Are you sure...?
COOP109016	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I appreciate it. You didn't have to go out of
your way.
COOP109022	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 they've got somethin' new. I think I'll
try it.
COOP109023	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What should I get then? My stomach wants that
today	 but my mind wants to try this...
COOP109024	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Have any new restaurants opened up? Maybe we
should see what's in the area.
COOP109025	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There are so many shops I haven't been to yet
here. Where should we go today?
COOP109026	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If food is art... then I feel like having a
better understanding of art might help me
develop my palette...
COOP109600	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Here it is. The new convenience store-limited
soba bento!
COOP109601	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They got some big restaurant making these.
Makes you wonder if it's any good.
COOP109602	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Are they actually tryin' to make it taste as
good as the fresh stuff?
COOP109603	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Or did they prioritize convenience over
flavor?
COOP109604	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do you think?
COOP109605	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I have high hopes for this.|You get what you pay for.
COOP109606	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 I agree. Being able to enjoy
restaurant-level quality from a convenience
store sounds nice.
COOP109607	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 you're right. It's less than half the
price you pay at the restaurant.
COOP109608	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Can't ask for much more than that.
COOP109609	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right	 I'm off to the counter. You want yours
warmed up?
COOP109610	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? They come in different flavors. It's
either pork or miso for the base.
COOP109611	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Cool	 might as well try both. Let's have half
each and trade.
COOP109612	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Glad you're here. These are pretty filling.
Don't think I could finish 'em both on
my own.
COOP109613	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I helped Shun research food at
the convenience store. I got a
bento by a classic restaurant.
COOP109614	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I helped Shun research food at
the convenience store. I got a
pasta dish by a famous chef.
COOP109615	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I helped Shun research food at
the convenience store. I got a
popular patisserie's dessert.
COOP109616	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I helped Shun research food at
the convenience store. I got
some snacks from my childhood.
COOP109617	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I helped Shun research food at
the convenience store. I got
fried snacks from the counter.
COOP109618	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	By the way	 what do you usually have for
lunch?
COOP109619	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Your parents aren't around to make lunch for
you	 right?
COOP109620	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I buy it from the school store.|Depends on the day.|I don't eat lunch.
COOP109621	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right. The bread they sell there is great.
I'll never get sick of it.
COOP109622	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No wonder the students love it so much. Been
that way for years.
COOP109623	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I get that. Gotta switch it up every now
and then.
COOP109624	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm like that too. I let my mood decide what
to eat.
COOP109625	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You don't? Really? How do you survive the
afternoon classes?
COOP109626	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You sure you're holding up? Seriously	 eat
something.
COOP109627	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right	 let's check out the school store.
After all	 sometimes the best stuff is right
under your nose.
COOP109628	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Go ahead. Choose whatever.
COOP109629	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Let me treat you this time.|You sure you have enough?
COOP109630	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You don't mind? Truth is	 things have been
kinda tight for me this month.
COOP109631	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well actually... things are kinda tight right
now. Think we could split today?
COOP109632	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I owe you one. I'll treat you next time we
hang out. That's a promise.
COOP109633	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I checked out the school store
with Shun. We nabbed stuff
that's usually out of stock.
COOP109634	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I checked out the school store
with Shun. We were hungry and
ended up buying way too much.
COOP109635	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I checked out the school store
with Shun. We observed what
was popular before buying.
COOP109636	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I checked out the school store
with Shun. He gave me the
rundown on the new stock.
COOP109637	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I checked out the school store
with Shun. I decided to treat
him today.
COOP109638	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You might know Harajuku for the fashion	 but
they also have great restaurants here.
COOP109639	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The customers are sensitive to trends though	
so the turnover rate's sky high.
COOP109640	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do you normally check out when
you're here?
COOP109641	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Clothes.|Character shops.
COOP109642	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sounds about right. This is the fashion
district	 after all.
COOP109643	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That said	 I really don't know much about
what's hot and what's not...
COOP109644	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	When I was training to make ramen	 I just
went from my school uniform to my chef's
clothing and that was that.
COOP109645	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe you could give me some fashion advice
some time	 if it's not too much trouble.
COOP109646	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So that's what you're into... Uh	 didn't mean
that in a weird way.
COOP109647	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You just don't carry that stuff with you	
so I didn't expect it.
COOP109648	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Can't say I know much about that. Tell me
about it some time.
COOP109649	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 I think I'll hit a restaurant and see
what they're offering.
COOP109650	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There's a new ramen shop that I'm curious
about.
COOP109651	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I've seen pictures of their food online. The
toppings were a little unusual.
COOP109652	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm getting all of them. You'd better think
over what you're gonna order too.
COOP109653	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I hung with Shun in Harajuku.
We joined a line of customers
snaked around a cr√™pe shop.
COOP109654	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I hung with Shun in Harajuku.
He asked for my verdict on the
ramen we had together.
COOP109655	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I went with Shun to Harajuku.
We looked at clothes before
heading to a restaurant.
COOP109656	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I hung with Shun in Harajuku.
We had a fun time
eating on the go.
COOP109657	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I hung with Shun in Harajuku.
Today	 I decided to treat him.
COOP109658	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The atmosphere here's real nice.
COOP109659	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shops from a hundred years ago lined up right
next to brand new ones.
COOP109660	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's chaotic in a good way. Sort of like a
blend of the old and new.
COOP109661	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 anything you want to eat?
COOP109662	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A traditional rice cracker.|A social media-worthy fruit tea.
COOP109663	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 nice. I was thinkin' the same.
COOP109664	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I can smell freshly baked rice crackers in
the air.
COOP109665	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Y'know	 they cook those out front and cool
'em with a fan	 all the while hollerin' to
lure in customers the old-fashioned way.
COOP109666	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm sure I'll learn something new. Let's
head over.
COOP109667	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Social media-worthy	 huh? I've never given
that sorta stuff much thought.
COOP109668	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But I suppose there are some ramen shops that
are all about making their food look flashy.
COOP109669	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Who knows? Maybe I'll learn somethin' new.
Let's look for that.
COOP109670	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We can think over what to check out next
while we eat.
COOP109671	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Didn't expect to see so many shops here. It'd
be a waste to not see what they're about.
COOP109672	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh. Is that a line formin' over there?
COOP109673	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I like the way they're callin' out to
customers. Let's check it out later.
COOP109674	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shun and I visited Sensoji.
We strolled while enjoying
traditional snacks.
COOP109675	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shun and I visited Sensoji.
We tried trendy treats while
meandering the streets.
COOP109676	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shun and I visited Sensoji.
A friendly shop owner offered
us free samples.
COOP109677	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shun and I visited Sensoji.
We munched on fresh
meat cutlets and croquettes...
COOP109678	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shun and I visited Sensoji.
We snacked on street food
and washed off at a bathhouse.
COOP109679	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A while back	 I had a customer who was a food
researcher.
COOP109680	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	While they were eatin'	 they told me that
food is an art form.
COOP109681	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But	 like	 art is the stuff you see hangin'
in museums	 right?
COOP109682	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Saying cooking is just like that doesn't make
much sense to me.
COOP109683	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Though I s'pose I see how artists and chefs
could be similar in some ways.
COOP109684	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I wonder if studyin' art will help my
cooking.
COOP109685	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's worth a try.|Food is art!
COOP109686	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You think so too? Creating something takes
a lot of effort.
COOP109687	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It takes heaps of trial and error till you
end up with somethin' you approve of.
COOP109688	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I guess	 yeah	 art is like food. You can tell
what the creator struggled with.
COOP109689	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Y-Yeah	 that's what I said... Well	 that
customer said it first.
COOP109690	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe it is better to think of them as one
and the same.
COOP109691	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Studyin' someone else's cooking is the same
as studyin' someone else's art.
COOP109692	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	In other words	 I can learn how to cook
better by lookin' at the art on display here.
COOP109693	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right? Man	 I dunno. At least with food	
you'll know when you try it.
COOP109694	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	With art	 I don't know enough of the basics
to be able to tell.
COOP109700	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 so I've got a serious favor to
ask you...
COOP109701	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Can I use your place to whip up some
desserts?
COOP109702	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The kitchen at my place just isn't set up for
that sorta thing.
COOP109704	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You mean it!? Thanks	 man! You're a total
godsend!
COOP109705	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 hold up. I gotta get ingredients first.
Do you live near a supermarket?
COOP109707	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 my bad. No	 it doesn't have to be now.
Whenever works for you.
COOP109708	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	...Thanks again man.
COOP109709	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa! This place ain't too shabby at all.
COOP109710	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Pops always used to say that you can tell
a lot about someone by their kitchen.
COOP109711	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I think he was onto somethin'. This kitchen's
totally your vibe	 {NAME2}.
COOP109712	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I bet I could cook up all kinds of new stuff
in a place as nice as this.
COOP109714	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh yeah? I'm sure you can't!
COOP109715	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hmm	 that's a good question. It's kinda hard
to put into words...
COOP109716	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ever since the Ramen Promenade 2 incident	
I've been feelin' like I haven't been taking
my cookin' seriously enough.
COOP109717	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 I want to try makin' somethin' totally
out of my wheelhouse.
COOP109718	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I feel like it'd do me some good to shake
things up from time to time. Y'know	 cook
somethin' unrelated to ramen.
COOP109719	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't hopin' to
develop my palette more	 like when we're
hangin' out...
COOP109720	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But that's different. I mainly wanna use this
as a chance to unwind a little bit.
COOP109721	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyway	 as thanks for lettin' me use your
kitchen	 I'm gonna whip up some wicked treats
so get ready for a taste explosion!
COOP109722	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 don't be shy if you have any requests.
I'll keep 'em in mind for next time.
COOP109723	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay	 then! Time to try and expand my
culinary repertoire!
COOP110000	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan...
COOP110001	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well...
COOP110004	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	*sigh*
COOP110006	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hold on... Are you offering to lend me
an ear!?
COOP110007	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	All right... See you later...
COOP110008	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	In that case	 to get straight to it...
COOP110009	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was just wondering how to understand
teenager's feelings and‚Äî Oh!
COOP110010	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That's it! Why don't you teach me	
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP110011	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I'm sorry. You must think I'm totally
buggin'	 asking you that out of nowhere.
COOP110012	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	To explain	 my nephew is going to be staying
with us for a while.
COOP110013	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He just graduated high school	 which means
you two are around the same age.
COOP110014	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Apparently he has a dream of becoming... some
kind of special actor?
COOP110015	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He wants to come to Tokyo and work part-time
while going to acting school.
COOP110017	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I know	 right?
COOP110018	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Someone who leaves home to pursue a
dream in this day and age... I really want to
support him.
COOP110019	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But	 I don't know	 I just feel like the
generation gap is wider than ever these days.
COOP110020	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Maybe it makes me majorly clueless	 but I'm
the type of person who doesn't know when to
shut up.
COOP110021	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What do you think	 {NAME2}-chan? Am I a
total space cadet?
COOP110023	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 dear! You're a sweet kid	 but you still
need to learn what a girl wants to hear.
COOP110024	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Yeah	 I thought so... But I do recognize that
in myself	 you know.
COOP110025	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wait	 you don't know what that means?
It's someone who's totally out of touch with
what's going on around them.
COOP110026	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Basically	 someone who can't read the room.
Huh... So kids today don't know that one?
COOP110027	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Anyway	 that's the situation.
COOP110028	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	How am I supposed to support him if I'm just
stressing him out all the time?
COOP110029	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He's family. I don't want to do anything to
trouble my hubby.
COOP110030	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So...
COOP110031	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'll be counting on your help!
COOP110032	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What	 {NAME2}-chan? You're the one who
offered to hear me out!
COOP110033	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Which means you're going to tell me all about
how teens today feel.
COOP110034	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan! You've grown up to be such
a reliable young man.
COOP110035	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Of course	 there's something in it for
you too.
COOP110036	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Did your mom ever tell you that I used to be
a stylist before I got married?
COOP110037	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess showing you would be quicker. Hold on
just a sec.
COOP110038	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Here. For you.
COOP110040	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Clothes! They're wicked cool!
COOP110041	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I just said I was a stylist. They're clothes	
no duh.
COOP110042	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	My hubby works in the clothing industry	 so
he brings samples home for me all the time.
COOP110043	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This is an outfit I coordinated from head
to toe!
COOP110044	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Try it on!
COOP110046	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Yup! We've got to see how it looks on you!
Your home's nearby	 isn't it?
COOP110047	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Based on your shoulder width	 I think the
size should be right.
COOP110048	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Run along. I'll be waiting here.
COOP110050	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 that's nice. It fits you perfectly too.
COOP110051	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Can you give me a little spin?
COOP110053	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Totally tubular!
COOP110054	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 things are about to get a lot busier
for me! I've got to be a good wife	 a good
auntie...
COOP110055	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	A good stylist too. Just how many hats does a
girl gotta wear!?
COOP110057	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Talking to a kid in a school uniform makes me
feel like I'm back in school too.
COOP110058	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Speaking of	 here's a shot of me back when I
was young. And there's my hubby	 of course!
COOP110059	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This is Gal style‚Äîshort skirts and loose
socks! Hubby and I were unstoppable
back then!
COOP110061	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Looking forward to picking your brain even
more from now on!
COOP110063	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh dear! I almost forgot	 my hubby's coming
home early today.
COOP110064	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I've got to get dinner ready. See you later!
COOP110201	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan. How are you?
COOP110202	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Your timing couldn't be more perfect.
Remember how you were going to teach me all
about how teens feel?
COOP110203	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I actually have something I need to ask you
about. Do you have a minute?
COOP110205	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great! Okay	 I'll make this short.
COOP110206	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Well	 let me know when you have the
time	 okay?
COOP110207	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So about my hubby's nephew... You know	
the one who wants to be an actor.
COOP110208	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Now that we've agreed to take him in	 we've
been messaging back and forth	 but um...
COOP110209	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Do you know what a multimedia message is	
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP110211	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Yeah	 of course you do! Everyone does! Right?
COOP110212	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh... Well yeah	 I guess texting photos
these days isn't any different from texting
messages.
COOP110213	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It was like a text message	 but for sending
photographs you took on your phone.
COOP110214	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You at least know what a text message is	
right...?
COOP110215	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Anyway	 my nephew's new to the area	 so I
thought I'd go pick him up from the station.
COOP110216	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I figured it'd be better to know what he
looks like	 so I asked him to send me a pic
via MMS...
COOP110217	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But I never expected him to have no idea what
I was talking about!
COOP110218	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess I really do live in a different world
than teens these days.
COOP110220	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh? Hehe	 how poetic.
COOP110221	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You're right. If I get down on myself over
something like this	 then what has my life
been all about!?
COOP110222	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ah...
COOP110223	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That sounds like something out of a comic
book. Did you know that when you said it?
COOP110224	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You're right. If I get down on myself over 
something like this	 then what has my life
been all about!?
COOP110225	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Um	 ten	 twenty... Wait	 what're you trying
to make me admit to!?
COOP110226	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So yeah	 there's a huge age gap! Is that a bad
thing?
COOP110227	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Still	 if I get down on myself over something
like this	 then what has my life been all
about!?
COOP110228	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Back when I was in high school	 just planning
to meet someone took so much effort.
COOP110229	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	My hubby didn't have a beeper or a cellphone	
so I had to call his house number.
COOP110230	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But that meant anyone could pick up. It was
sooo awkward when his mom answered!
COOP110231	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But I powered through it because I wanted
to see him. If I could just recapture that
feeling	 I'd be invincible!
COOP110232	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Thanks for hearing me out	 {NAME2}-chan.
Now I'm raring to go!
COOP110234	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 right. A token of my thanks. Hold on just
a second.
COOP110235	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Here you go. Try it on.
COOP110236	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And spin.
COOP110237	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wicked!
COOP110238	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh no! I have to go and iron hubby's shirts.
COOP110239	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He said he has a really important meeting
tomorrow. See you later!
COOP110401	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan. I've been seeing a lot of
you lately.
COOP110402	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And what perfect timing. I need some help
from my teenage consultant.
COOP110403	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	There's something I wanted to ask you about.
Do you have some time to spare?
COOP110405	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great! I'll make it quick then. Well	
quick by my standards.
COOP110406	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Well	 let me know when you have
time	 okay?
COOP110407	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So out of curiosity... How much cash do you
have on you?
COOP110409	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Right? I always keep cash on me just in case.
COOP110410	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I guess so. That is a weird thing to ask
someone out of nowhere	 isn't it?
COOP110411	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	No	 no. Do I really seem like an
ex-delinquent!?
COOP110412	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's about the nephew I mentioned before.
He started living with us recently.
COOP110413	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And well	 I guess it's a habit as an
ex-stylist	 but I'm always looking at what
he's wearing.
COOP110414	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Then I realized	 I've never seen him with a
wallet. So	 I asked if he was carrying any
cash on him.
COOP110415	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Then he said something about being
cashless? And paying with a "smart wallet"?
COOP110416	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I thought forgetting your wallet at home was
something everyone experienced.
COOP110417	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But I guess teens these days don't know that
feeling either	 huh?
COOP110419	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? I guess you see things more like
I do.
COOP110420	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Yeah	 I guess not anymore...
COOP110421	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 so you're one of them?
COOP110422	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'd kind of like to see how you'd react to
that situation one day.
COOP110423	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess our approach to money	 or just life
in general	 is fundamentally different now...
COOP110424	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	A few years into our relationship	 my hubby
took me to a really nice teppanyaki place.
COOP110425	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess it would've been right around the
time when we were graduating.
COOP110426	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	There was foie gras	 there was lobster	 and
there was a whole hibachi performance!
COOP110427	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Then while I was heading to the bathroom	
my hubby went to go pay for everything.
COOP110428	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I saw him counting the bills in his wallet	
with a worried look on his face.
COOP110429	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Seeing him then... I don't know	 it was like
the emotions were almost too much to handle.
COOP110430	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Stop it already	 {NAME2}-chan! You're way
too good at getting stories out of me!
COOP110431	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Still	 the inconvenience is what creates
memories I guess. But now we can't share
that anymore...
COOP110432	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Sorry	 what were we even talking about again?
COOP110434	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 right. That's why I came to you in the
first place.
COOP110435	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Yeah	 that's it! About my nephew not carrying
a wallet.
COOP110436	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You want to hear more about our date? As if!
I'll just leave it to your imagination!
COOP110437	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hehe	 I'm all over the place today. I'm not
even sure what it is I wanted to ask...
COOP110438	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But time just seems to fly by when I'm
talking with you	 {NAME2}-chan.
COOP110439	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I do think I figured one thing out though.
COOP110440	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I want my nephew to enjoy himself while he's
staying with us.
COOP110441	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So you know what that means! I'll be coming
back for more advice another time!
COOP110443	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh no! I forgot I left my hubby's pillowcase
out to dry!
COOP110444	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	See you	 {NAME2}-chan!
COOP110601	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan. So	 how've you been?
COOP110602	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm glad you're here. I need you to teach me
more about modern teens.
COOP110603	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	There's something I wanted to ask you about.
Is now a good time?
COOP110605	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great! Okay	 I'll make this short.
Short for me at least.
COOP110606	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Well	 let me know when you have a
spare moment	 okay?
COOP110607	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You know how they say that arguing with
someone is proof that you're close?
COOP110608	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Like	 me and my hubby are as lovey-dovey as
it gets	 but we always fight over the AC.
COOP110609	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	My nephew who came to live with us is pretty
candid in telling us what he wants.
COOP110610	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But we haven't fought a single time! Even
though he's been with us for a while!
COOP110611	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What do you think about that?
COOP110613	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I know	 right!? Being a teen is all about
snapping at adults for no good reason.
COOP110614	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 it's not good to hold onto a grudge!
I'd rather we fight and make up right after.
COOP110615	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ooh	 you might be onto something.
COOP110616	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Personally	 fighting's welcome under my roof.
COOP110617	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But maybe I did something that made him
dislike me...
COOP110618	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I have a son of my own you know. He found a
job and left home just this year.
COOP110619	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I always tried to be patient and
understanding with him because of how rough
my relationship was with my parents.
COOP110620	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	We both thought it was best to stay out of
each other's way... and so we never really
butt heads.
COOP110621	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Sometimes he comes back home and brings me a
little present.
COOP110622	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But he always buys me these ridiculously
fancy Japanese sweets and stuff.
COOP110624	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	There is! A big one!
COOP110625	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hello? Look	 I know you're a growing boy	
but listen!
COOP110626	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Anyway	 I like my sweet red bean paste
chunky. Always have	 always will.
COOP110627	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But he always gets smooth! Isn't that so sad?
We don't even know each other's preferences.
COOP110628	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So now that I've been given this opportunity	
I thought I'd do for my nephew what I
couldn't fo‚Äî
COOP110629	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh! <color=#FF423F>Leo</color>-chan.
COOP110630	Boy Cal<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ed Leo	I'm home	 Kayo-san.
COOP110631	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y Called Leo	Oh	 is this...?
COOP110632	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Yes	 this is {NAME2}-chan. He comes to talk
with me sometimes since we're neighbors.
COOP110633	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This is Leo Kamiyama-chan	 the nephew I'm
always talking about.
COOP110634	Boy Cal<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ed Leo	Hi there. Kayo-san's been kind enough to let
me stay here. Nice to meet you!
COOP110635	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Leo-chan's been going to a training program
to be a... What kind of actor was it?
COOP110636	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	A costumed stuntman. Well	 that still counts
as an actor.
COOP110637	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Those are the guys who perform in full body
suits and pull stunts in shows with heavy
special effects.
COOP110638	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 right... Sorry	 I still have trouble
remembering exactly what it's called.
COOP110639	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	That's fine	 really. Oh	 {NAME1}-kun	 do you
like superhero flicks?
COOP110641	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	That's great! I bet we'll get along
just fine.
COOP110642	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Haha. Well	 then you must have some favorite
Rangers or Riders from your childhood!
COOP110643	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Oh	 that's what all the real fans say! Are
you secretly a superhero fanboy?
COOP110644	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Phoenix Ranger Featherman	 Red Eagle!
COOP110645	L<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>o Kamiyama	So yeah	 that's my kind of thing. I'm really
into the classic stuff.
COOP110646	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I'm still training right now	 but I'm sending
resumes everywhere I can.
COOP110647	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I just have to keep practicing. No time for
complaining or getting lazy. Anyway	 nice
meeting you!
COOP110648	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 that's him. He's a bit odd	 but he's a
good kid all around.
COOP110649	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	In fact	 he may be a little too good. How
could you ever fight with such a sweet boy?
COOP110650	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But do you think that Leo-chan could secretly
dislike me?
COOP110652	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? I hope you're right...
COOP110653	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Huh? Oh	 maybe you're right. I'm probably
just overthinking things.
COOP110654	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Oh	 right. I brought home some snacks.
COOP110655	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Kayo-san	 you like chunky red bean paste	
right? These dorayaki are filled with it.
COOP110656	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	And while I'm here... {NAME1}-kun	 could we
swap contact info?
COOP110657	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Okay	 got it. Thanks! Talk to you later!
COOP110658	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh. I guess he doesn't hate me at all...
COOP110659	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And did you see how casually he asked for
your contact info? You kids really don't
waste any time.
COOP110660	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	To be honest	 I still feel like I have a lot
to learn about how teens feel.
COOP110661	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But I think I figured something out today.
COOP110662	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	There are some things every generation can
understand. There must be	 right?
COOP110663	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm feeling a lot more positive now after
our talk.
COOP110664	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Thank you	 {NAME2}-chan.
COOP110666	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh no! Kintsuba is hubby's favorite sweet!
COOP110667	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I need to tell Leo-chan to save him some!
COOP110668	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	See you	 {NAME2}-chan!
COOP110801	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan. How are you doing?
COOP110802	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was just hoping I'd run into you. Remember
how we talked about Leo-chan before?
COOP110803	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well I want your opinion on something. Do you
have some time now?
COOP110805	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great! I'll make it quick then.
I think it really will be short this time.
COOP110806	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Well	 let me know when you have a
moment to spare	 okay?
COOP110807	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So	 {NAME2}-chan	 do you have a favorite‚Äî
COOP110808	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I'm home.
COOP110809	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh! Welcome back	 Leo-chan.
COOP110810	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was just talking to {NAME2}-chan about
tomorrow.
COOP110811	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You were? I spoke with him about it too.
I know I just have to do my best.
COOP110812	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I started imitating ranger heroes when I was
a kid because I thought they were cool.
COOP110813	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I have to act like the perfect hero‚Äîthe kind
I've pictured in my head since way back then.
COOP110814	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But I don't have nearly enough time to
practice. I shouldn't even be standing here
talking right now!
COOP110815	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Sorry	 but I've gotta get an early start
tomorrow	 so I'm gonna head inside.
COOP110816	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	See you around	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP110817	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Leo-chan says he has some sort of big
audition for a TV show.
COOP110818	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 anyway	 as I was saying...
COOP110819	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What's your favorite food to have in a bento	
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP110821	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ooh	 nice and hearty. And it even tastes
good cold.
COOP110822	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's a staple for a reason. And it's good
sweet or savory!
COOP110823	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh! Right	 of course! I'm more of a rice
person as well!
COOP110824	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	In that case	 for Leo-chan's lunch tomorrow
I'll make...
COOP110825	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Your favorite	 plus some pork cutlets and
beefsteak!
COOP110827	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And that won't be all! It'll be filled to the
brim with my love!
COOP110828	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	True. If this was for my hubby	 I'd be a bit
worried about his next checkup.
COOP110829	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But Leo-chan's still young. I'm sure he'll
burn it all off in no time.
COOP110830	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Exactly! I'm so glad you get it!
COOP110831	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 now that I know tomorrow's menu	 that's
all for today! Nice and quick!
COOP110832	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I hope Leo-chan's audition goes well...
COOP110833	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You know	 my parents never supported my
dreams when I was in high school.
COOP110835	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I get along with them fine now	 but I guess
I was kind of a reckless kid.
COOP110836	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Always hanging out with friends in Shibuya
instead of studying...
COOP110837	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I mooched off of them constantly	 only to
turn around and say I wanted to be a stylist.
COOP110838	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Naturally they were against it.
COOP110839	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I understand their perspective now	 but
of course I rebelled back then.
COOP110840	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I achieved my dream in the end	 but they've
still never approved...
COOP110841	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 what am I even talking about? Sorry	
I know I already said we were finished.
COOP110842	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I feel almost unburdened when we talk. Like
some weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
COOP110843	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Who needs a spa day!
COOP110844	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I can just talk to you! Hehe.
COOP110846	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	See you later. Don't stay out too late just
because your parents aren't home!
COOP111001	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan. I'm glad I ran into
you here.
COOP111002	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's about Leo-chan again...
COOP111003	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This time it's a little serious. Do you have
time to talk?
COOP111005	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? That's great! This is a little too
much for me to figure out alone.
COOP111006	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 okay. That's too bad. Could we talk when
you do have some time?
COOP111007	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Remember what I told you about Leo-chan
before?
COOP111008	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 it sounds like his audition didn't go
so well...
COOP111009	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I want to encourage him	 but I don't know
what to say.
COOP111011	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 sorry	 but I think that might do more
harm than good.
COOP111012	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Because	 well...
COOP111013	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That might be true	 but... wouldn't you want
to help if you were me?
COOP111014	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Just what I'd expect a kid these days to say.
I really want to help him if I can!
COOP111015	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	The thing about Leo-chan trying to make it as
an actor is that he only has so much time.
COOP111016	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He promised his parents he'd come home if he
didn't get anywhere within the year.
COOP111017	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So I don't see it as someone else's problem.
I want his dream to come true.
COOP111018	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess the road to becoming a pro will
always have some obstacles...
COOP111019	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But doesn't that make you want to help keep
his morale up	 or at least try to?
COOP111020	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I know! How about I serve him up a
tasty meal?
COOP111021	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Maybe that could help cheer him up?
COOP111023	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	His favorite... What is Leo-chan's favorite?
COOP111024	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He never talks about his likes or dislikes.
Oh no! Do I know nothing about him?
COOP111025	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It would seem unnatural if I suddenly started
fussing over him	 wouldn't it?
COOP111026	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I see... Fussing over Leo-chan would just
make it harder on him.
COOP111027	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It'd be so sad if I tried to help him	 only
for it to have the opposite effect.
COOP111028	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess the classic option is the best	 huh?
COOP111029	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 but we had curry just yesterday. Won't he
get sick of having it two nights in a row?
COOP111030	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Sorry	 I'll give it some more thought. Thanks
for helping me with something so tough!
COOP111032	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Talk to you later then. Living alone can't be
easy	 but make sure to eat well!
COOP111033	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Sorry for the sudden text. Do you have a
second?
COOP111034	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Kayo-san's been asking you for advice on all
kinds of stuff	 right?
COOP111035	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I was wondering if I could ask you for some
advice myself.
COOP111036	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Sorry. I know this is totally coming out of
nowhere...
COOP111038	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Thanks.
COOP111039	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	This might take a while. Could we meet
outside in a bit?
COOP111041	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	{NAME1}-kun! Sorry for keeping you waiting.
COOP111042	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Anyway	 about my problem...
COOP111043	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You heard from Kayo-san that my audition
didn't go well	 right?
COOP111044	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	To be honest	 I thought I gave a pretty
decent performance.
COOP111045	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	The issue was probably the interview that
came after.
COOP111047	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	No	 nothing like that. I was never at a loss
for words at least.
COOP111048	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	What!? No! I'd never do that.
COOP111049	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	One of the judges asked me if there's
anything special I keep in mind while I'm
performing.
COOP111050	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	He's a famous stuntman who's still active	
so I figured I might as well be honest.
COOP111051	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	To fully become the role asked of me,
whether that's a hero or a monster.
COOP111052	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Or something along those lines anyway.
COOP111053	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But then he looked all melancholic. Or maybe	
awkwardly disappointed?
COOP111054	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I feel like that was the wrong answer.
COOP111055	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	It's impossible for me to know what the right
answer for him would be.
COOP111056	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But what do you think he wanted to hear?
COOP111058	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Hm? I mean	 the role the director wants me to
perform...
COOP111059	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Hm? Well	 I want to express my own kind of...
COOP111060	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Wait	 but if I perform the way others expect
me to	 then my own style would be...
COOP111061	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You know	 I think I might've just found my
answer.
COOP111062	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But it's still kind of vague. I need to think
on this some more.
COOP111063	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Thanks for talking to me today. Now I see
why Kayo-san comes to you all the time.
COOP111065	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	That's not true. Sure	 you may not say
much	 but...
COOP111066	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I think that's why what you do say really
cuts deep.
COOP111067	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	It'd be great if I could ask you for advice
again. Oh	 but don't tell Kayo-san	 okay?
COOP111068	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I'd feel bad if I made her worry over me.
COOP111201	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan!
COOP111202	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was just hoping to talk to you. It's about
Leo-chan	 as usual.
COOP111203	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Something came up that I need some advice on.
Do you have a minute?
COOP111205	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great! I'll make this short.
COOP111206	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Well	 let me know when you have time
to spare	 okay?
COOP111207	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So	 just as I feared	 Leo-chan's been down
ever since that audition.
COOP111208	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I've been doing what I can to act normal and
pretend like I haven't noticed.
COOP111209	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But what I really want to do is hear him out	
encourage him	 cook him something tasty!
COOP111210	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	At the same time	 I'm afraid that maybe he
doesn't want that at all. I feel stuck.
COOP111211	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What in the world should I do?
COOP111212	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wouldn't it be easier for the both of us if I
just stopped tiptoeing around it?
COOP111214	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You're right... But I'm not a teen. I can't
stop myself from worrying about him.
COOP111215	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You think so? Wait	 maybe you're onto
something!
COOP111216	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Who are you calling an old lady!?
COOP111217	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ah	 but you're probably right about
the meddling part at least.
COOP111218	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I wouldn't have come to you in the first
place if I wasn't so worried.
COOP111219	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Be honest. How do you think Leo-chan would
feel about me getting so stressed over him?
COOP111221	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Huh... That's kind of a relief.
COOP111222	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was sweating up and down thinking he'd tell
me to shut up or go away.
COOP111223	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You saying that lifted my spirits a little.
COOP111224	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So thanks. I'm not going to give up yet!
COOP111226	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Okay	 talk to you later. Be sure to brush
your teeth before bed	 okay?
COOP111401	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan!
COOP111402	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Sorry to bother you	 but do you have a
second?
COOP111405	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Then please	 I need to ask you about
something!
COOP111406	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh. Well	 okay then... When you have a
moment	 I could really use your help.
COOP111407	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What do I do? I really messed up this time.
COOP111408	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You gave me all that advice	 and I might as
well have flushed it down the drain!
COOP111410	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 this is hard to say	 but...
COOP111411	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm sorry. It's just... I don't know what
to do.
COOP111412	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That's right. He...!
COOP111413	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Leo-chan said he wanted to leave for a while
to do some thinking.
COOP111414	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He said he's going to stay with one of his
seniors from the training school that lives
nearby.
COOP111415	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He gave me the address	 said he was sorry for
making me worry	 and then left.
COOP111417	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Leo-chan had been looking gloomy for so long	
I went and opened my big mouth.
COOP111418	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I suggested that things might go better if he
tried keeping a positive attitude.
COOP111419	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Then he went quiet for a while... and after
that he said he wanted to leave!
COOP111420	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm such an idiot! Do you think he's mad
at me?
COOP111421	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Please	 you have to tell me what I should do!
COOP111423	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You will? Sorry for the trouble	 but that'd
be a huge help.
COOP111424	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But‚Äî Wait. Maybe it's best coming from
another boy his own age.
COOP111425	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Okay... Please	 do what you can	
{NAME2}-chan.
COOP111426	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm so clueless	 running over there in a
panic could just make things worse.
COOP111427	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 right. Here's the address Leo-chan left
behind.
COOP111428	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Please help us... I don't mind if he doesn't
come back right away.
COOP111429	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm fine with whatever he thinks is best for
him. I'll worry about the future later.
COOP111430	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You actually came. It must have surprised you
to hear the news from Kayo-san.
COOP111431	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I left without giving it much thought	 but to
be honest	 I feel like I screwed up.
COOP111432	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I just haven't been able to stop thinking
about that audition.
COOP111433	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	And about what you said to me	 and about my
acting.
COOP111434	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Ultimately	 I guess that judge was trying
to tell me to express more of myself in my
roles.
COOP111435	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Even heroes are flesh-and-blood humans who
have their own emotions.
COOP111436	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	What's important as an actor is putting that
into a performance. Otherwise it'll be flat.
COOP111437	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I've been all wrong from the start. I only
ever thought about acting like a cool hero.
COOP111438	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Now I realize	 I've been working toward being
boring and one-dimensional
this whole time.
COOP111439	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	That shallow goal led me to ignore the people
in my life and my own feelings.
COOP111440	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	It was the only thing that mattered.
Everything else was just noise.
COOP111441	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I acted like it was pointless engaging with
people who don't know about the films I love.
COOP111442	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Then when things didn't go my way	 I panicked
and started shutting everyone out.
COOP111443	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I knew that Kayo-san was worrying about me	
but I thought I didn't have time to care.
COOP111444	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	How narcissistic am I?
COOP111445	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I just walked out on Kayo-san's hospitality
without giving it a second thought.
COOP111446	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	And I know how concerned she gets. She's
probably worried sick about me right now.
COOP111447	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I can't face her after everything I've done.
Hah...
COOP111449	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Do you think she'll forgive me?
COOP111450	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Do you really think so? I can still fix
things?
COOP111451	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Thank you. To be honest	 I think I was
looking for a reason to go back.
COOP111452	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	As pathetic as it sounds	 some part of me was
hoping someone would come get me.
COOP111453	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I never imagined it'd be you though. Looks
like you're the real hero here.
COOP111454	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Let me just thank my senior for letting me
crash. Can you wait a minute?
COOP111455	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Leo-chan...!
COOP111456	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Kayo-san. I'm... I'm so sorry!
COOP111457	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Um	 I've been‚Äî
COOP111458	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's okay! You don't need to explain a thing!
COOP111459	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 thank goodness! Welcome home	 Leo-chan.
COOP111460	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	{NAME2}-chan	 thank you!
COOP111462	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Let's go home and have some dinner.
COOP111601	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 is that {NAME2}-chan?
COOP111602	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Perfect timing. Leo-chan and I were just
about to go shopping together.
COOP111603	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Are you busy? I'm going to make us a nice
dinner if you'd like to join.
COOP111605	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great!
COOP111606	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This can be my way of thanking you for all
you've done for us!
COOP111607	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? All right	 but come see us when
you're free	 okay?
COOP111608	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Okay	 let's head to the supermarket. But you
only get to pick one snack each	 got it?
COOP111610	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	We're really going to splurge today. Let's
load up on sukiyaki beef!
COOP111611	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Whoa! There's no way I can eat this much!
COOP111612	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Being a stuntman takes a lot out of you	
doesn't it? And you're still a growing boy!
COOP111613	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Not to mention {NAME2}-chan is joining us.
We'll demolish all of this no problem!
COOP111615	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Okay	 I think that's just about everything.
COOP111616	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hubby said he'll be home early today	 so I'll
need to get started right away!
COOP111617	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm going to head straight home. What about
you two?
COOP111618	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I was going to talk to {NAME1}-kun for a bit
more before going back.
COOP111619	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Sure. Just don't come home too late!
COOP111620	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That goes for you too	 {NAME2}-chan.
No shying out from dinner now!
COOP111622	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	So as you can see	 Kayo-san and I are really
getting along now.
COOP111623	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	And it's all thanks to you	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP111625	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You can. I'm sorry for making you worry too.
COOP111626	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Well	 about that...
COOP111627	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You think so? Maybe I've matured a bit after
all of this.
COOP111628	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I told Kayo-san everything I told you
that day.
COOP111629	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Then she told me all about how she'd been
feeling.
COOP111630	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	We were both being overly careful around each
other	 which led to a big misunderstanding.
COOP111631	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	So we decided that from now on	 we'll be open
and honest with each other.
COOP111632	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	And that's why I'm leaving... again.
COOP111633	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	We're having sukiyaki today as my farewell
party.
COOP111635	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Well	 it's kind of hard to explain.
COOP111636	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Yeah	 but that's actually why I was able to
be completely honest with her about this.
COOP111637	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	No	 not at all! Well	 okay... Maybe a little.
COOP111638	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But that's not why I'm leaving.
COOP111639	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	This isn't about being annoyed by other
people	 it's about what I have to do for
myself.
COOP111640	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Now that I understand what I'm trying to do	
being near people who fuss over me...
COOP111641	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Well	 it feels like I might just end up
mooching off them.
COOP111642	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I really do appreciate Kayo-san's support.
It's super encouraging.
COOP111643	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Especially considering my parents aren't as
approving. But I think she's done enough.
COOP111644	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Now I need to really face myself and create
my own form of expression.
COOP111645	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Think of it like a superhero training
montage. I think that's what's next for me.
COOP111647	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Oh	 we should probably head back! Don't want
Kayo-san to worry again.
COOP111648	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I'm really grateful for everything you've
done	 {NAME1}-kun.
COOP111649	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I'll do my best to make sure you'll see me on
TV one day.
COOP111650	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But we can talk about that some other time.
Let's go eat some sukiyaki!
COOP111801	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan.
COOP111802	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Perfect. There's something I want to talk to
you about.
COOP111803	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Do you have time?
COOP111805	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Great! I'll make this quick.
COOP111806	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? Well	 let me know when you have a
moment	 okay?
COOP111807	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I just finished seeing Leo-chan off.
COOP111808	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	As of today	 it's back to two people around
our dinner table	 which is... a little sad.
COOP111809	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Thanks again for helping me with him. I think
I really would've been lost on my own.
COOP111810	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Error: tkabnt-KB
COOP111811	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But I learned a lot through all of this.
COOP111812	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Including the fact that I still have a lot
left to learn from others	 even at my age...
COOP111813	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was a little surprised by everything that
happened.
COOP111815	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	As much as I don't want to admit it	 I guess
this is what the generation gap feels like.
COOP111816	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You said it. I even got you wrapped up in it.
COOP111817	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm not so sure about that one. You're pretty
odd	 {NAME2}-chan.
COOP111818	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	The days I spent fighting with my parents
feel so fresh all of a sudden.
COOP111819	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Some kids today have the exact same problems
I had back then.
COOP111820	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But now I realize there are other kids with
problems completely different than mine.
COOP111821	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I suppose you really can't assume that
everyone's on the same page as you.
COOP111823	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I mostly ended up going in circles.
COOP111824	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I didn't plan on it	 but I guess we are.
COOP111825	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	{NAME2}-chan... Was that your idea of a
compliment?
COOP111826	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I thought I could help him with anything as
long as I tried.
COOP111827	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But it wasn't that simple in the end.
COOP111828	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Like Leo-chan hitting that creative wall...
COOP111829	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That's not an easy thing to help someone get
over	 is it?
COOP111830	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And having someone fret over you while you're
already having a hard time is bound to get
annoying.
COOP111831	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Looking back	 I should've just kept an eye on
him instead of panicking like I did.
COOP111833	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You were thinking that this whole time!? You
should have told me then!
COOP111834	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh wait. Maybe you did say something along
those lines and I just didn't catch it...
COOP111835	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I know! It's easy to say all of that	 but
when it's really happening to you...
COOP111836	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That's right. It is a lesson. That you helped
teach me	 {NAME2}-chan.
COOP111837	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Besides	 even if I'd done everything right
and things worked out well...
COOP111838	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It'd really be no thanks to me anyway.
COOP111839	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	He's the one who's working hard	 so his
success is his own.
COOP111840	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You shouldn't dwell on other people's
problems as if they're your own. But if
things go well for them...
COOP111841	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	...you should be as happy as if it were you!
Is that the kind of thing you learn with age?
COOP111842	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	If it is	 then maybe getting older isn't so
bad after all.
COOP111843	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Not that I'm hoping to get older any
time soon!
COOP111844	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	If a young person ever comes to me for help
again	 I'm going to handle it a lot better.
COOP111846	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's been a while	 so how about we get back
to our usual routine? My way of saying
thanks!
COOP111847	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Here you are. I think you know how this goes.
COOP111848	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And spin.
COOP111849	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Fresh!
COOP111850	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ah! I need to get a bath ready for my hubby!
COOP111851	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Okay then	 {NAME2}-chan. See you next time
I need some advice on something!
COOP118282	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	No way	 that's for me? I do like this kind of
thing	 you know!
COOP118283	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's a little scary how you can guess what
I like	 even at my age...
COOP118284	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 of course I meant that in a good way!
You're just awful sometimes	 you little
player...
COOP118285	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 this is for me?
COOP118286	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Nice one! That kind of thoughtfulness will
make you popular with the girls	 you know?
COOP118300	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 look who it is. Do you need something	
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP118301	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Where do you wanna head to?
COOP118302	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Aww	 oh well. Let's chat another time	 'kay?
COOP118303	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You wanna go there	 {NAME2}-chan? Okey
dokey	 let's go!
COOP118304	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Err	 that's a no go	 {NAME2}-chan. Got
another place in mind?
COOP118310	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan! Are you free?
COOP118311	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Would you like to hang out with me? I'd like
to learn more about what teens are into these
days.
COOP118313	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Aw	 thanks! This is a little much for me to
figure out all on my own	 you see.
COOP118315	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Really? That's too bad. Maybe when you have
some time	 okay?
COOP118320	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Harajuku! It feels like it's been forever...
I want to say I was here all the time as
a kid.
COOP118321	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Seems like it's still the center of all the
latest trends. I'm glad that's stayed the
same.
COOP118322	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That does mean things change so fast here	
though. I wonder if any of the shops I know
are still around.
COOP118324	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I know it's a bit of an oxymoron	 but I'm
sure they must exist	 right?
COOP118325	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	A place that stays on top of trends even as
it ages... Just like what I'm trying to do!
COOP118326	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Just how old do you think I am!?
COOP118327	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Aah	 I guess you're not wrong to ask. I know
more shops from way before the current
generation was even born.
COOP118328	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Aaanyway	 now that we're here	 it's time for
my dose of youthful experience‚Äî ah	 I mean	
youthful inspiration!
COOP118329	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ooh	 I know what's popular these days.
Popcorn	 right?
COOP118331	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	S-Seriously!? Well	 that's Harajuku for you.
Here one minute and gone the next!
COOP118332	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	More interested in chow than charm	 huh?
Well	 now you've got my tummy growling.
COOP118333	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Why don't we look around and stop to nibble
on anything that looks yummy along the way?
COOP118350	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ooh	 I came here with my hubby
when I was younger!
COOP118351	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But he was dozing off before I even knew it!
I can't believe it's been so long since I was
last here.
COOP118352	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Though I'm sure you'd rather be here with
someone closer to your own age	 right
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP118354	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That's a good way to look at it. Just to warn
you	 it'd be a real mood-killer if you fell
asleep too.
COOP118355	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Of course	 that didn't stop me from being
head over heels for my hubby! Hehe.
COOP118356	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Don't worry! My hubby isn't nearly that
small-minded.
COOP118357	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Besides	 a pinch of jealousy can be the trick
to keeping a marriage from growing stale!
COOP118358	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Although I have a feeling that teens would
rather hang out somewhere more fun than a
planetarium.
COOP118359	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Isn't it boring? You know	 unless you're
really into the stars or something.
COOP118361	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Huh	 I didn't expect that! Then how about you
tell me all about them?
COOP118362	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh? I know more about them than you might
expect too. There was this anime	 you see...
COOP118369	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	The stars are supposed to look pretty
tonight. Want to take a look at the sky?
COOP118380	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Do young people tend to go on dates to places
like this these days?
COOP118381	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So many of them	 yourself included	 just feel
more mature than we were back then	 you know?
COOP118382	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Or maybe it's just me? I may have grown
older	 but I still feel just as young at
heart...
COOP118384	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You think so too? I mean	 being an adult is
nothing to be proud of on its own...
COOP118385	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But it does trouble me to know that I don't
have the... dignity that comes with age?
COOP118386	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh my! You certainly have a way with words.
COOP118387	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm sure you're just saying that to be nice	
but I'll accept the compliment. Thank you!
COOP118388	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	All right then! How about I start acting like
the adult here and take the lead?
COOP118389	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Of course	 I do love my hubby	 so let's just
enjoy Odaiba in a nice	 wholesome way.
COOP118390	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Isn't there an amusement park over there?
Something-or-other-polis?
COOP118391	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Let's go visit that today. I haven't been
there in a while!
COOP118392	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I bet the rides are more impressive than they
used to be	 too. Ooh	 this is so exciting!
COOP118393	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	C'mon	 {NAME2}-chan! Hurry up!
COOP118410	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So this is the station closest to your
school? I guess you must always be using it	
then!
COOP118411	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	How lovely. It's like you can smell the youth
in the air here!
COOP118413	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 maybe I should've said it's the
atmosphere. It reminds me of my student days.
COOP118414	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Like a ghost of my youth? A time I can never
go back to again.
COOP118415	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	No	 of course not! I don't mean a literal
smell	 you know.
COOP118416	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wait	 but maybe it does smell a little funky
here... No	 I must be imagining it!
COOP118417	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I took the train in high school too. I'd wait
for my now hubby	 and we'd go home together.
COOP118418	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Of course we'd always take a detour. Like	
Where to today? Oh	 those were the days!
COOP118419	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I know! Nothing says "heading home from
school" like buying a yummy treat on the way!
COOP118420	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What snacks do you and your friends usually
buy around here	 {NAME2}-chan?
COOP118422	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Croquettes? Sounds great! If my memory serves
me... my hubby and I used to love those.
COOP118423	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 right. Isn't this area known for curry?
The curry bread must be delicious	 then!
COOP118424	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 that decides it. Let's go grab
something to eat right away.
COOP118431	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 want to head out on a neighborhood
patrol?
COOP118450	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I haven't gone to the movies in forever! My
hubby and I just stream them at home.
COOP118469	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Not that I'm complaining	 but there is
something special about going to a theater!
COOP118451	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You're young	 {NAME2}-chan. I imagine you
don't go to the movies much either	 right?
COOP118453	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I thought so. But movies are impressive on
another level when you see them here.
COOP118454	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You can't get things like big	 booming sound
when you're watching at home!
COOP118455	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	A what...? Wow	 you sound like a real expert!
COOP118456	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What a surprise! I heard that kids don't go
to the movies anymore	 but I guess some of
them do!
COOP118457	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And don't they have that 3D and 4D stuff now?
Theaters are really changing with the times.
COOP118458	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 I suppose they had those 3D glasses when
I was a kid. You know	 with the red and blue
lenses?
COOP118460	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I guess you still wear glasses	 but they
don't have those tacky colored lenses
anymore!
COOP118461	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Huh? It's not like we're talking about the
primary colors here! Never mind	 I guess you
don't know.
COOP118462	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 the movie's about to start! We should
head to our seats.
COOP118470	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I heard that it's best to avoid the phrase
back in my day. I have to keep up with the
youngsters!
COOP118471	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	At places like this	 showing off your
knowledge of the night sky would surely make
your popularity skyrocket... right?
COOP118472	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So much to do	 so much to see! What should we
check out today?
COOP118473	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Doing the walk to school like this after all
these years feels strangely nostalgic to me.
COOP118474	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So	 what's the movie for today? If it's any
good	 I'll drag my hubby along next time and
make him watch it!
COOP118500	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan! Have a minute? I know I
shouldn't worry about this	 but...
COOP118501	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Have you been keeping on top of your
household chores? When you're alone	 it's
easy to neglect them	 right?
COOP118502	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	So I was thinking	 I'd be more than happy to
offer you... my special housekeeping service!
COOP118503	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 of course	 I won't charge you a dime	
{NAME2}-chan. How could I after everything
you've done for me?
COOP118505	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 glad to hear you're on board! Time
to bust out the mop and bucket. To
{NAME2}-chan's house!
COOP118507	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh my	 is it really that messy? Well when
you need a hand	 just say the word	 okay
{NAME2}-chan?
COOP118530	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wow	 it's cleaner than I thought! Honestly	
I'm surprised.
COOP118531	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	My son's idea of cleaning was just to
rearrange the mess!
COOP118533	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh {NAME2}-chan	 you diligent young man!
I wish my son was here to hear this.
COOP118534	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Now I'm worried about him... I wonder if he's
looking after himself properly...
COOP118535	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	*gasp* You're right. I am	 aren't I?
COOP118536	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	When someone refuses to clean when I tell
them to	 then I know I'm gonna have to roll
up my sleeves...
COOP118537	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Well	 I'm here now	 so might as well be
thorough.
COOP118538	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Aha! What have we here? Look at all this
dust!
COOP118540	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	H-Hey! Who're you calling... Oh	 I suppose
you have a point.
COOP118541	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I should seriously try to suppress my inner
mom instincts... Lesson learned!
COOP118542	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Stepmom? Wait	 are you seriously thinking of
us as family for realsies!?
COOP118543	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Shut up	 could you even imagine? We'd get
along so well!
COOP118544	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 look at me babbling. Let's get back on
track. Cleaning! That's why we're here!
COOP118545	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm gonna send all those li'l dust bunnies
hoppin' into the trash can one by one!
COOP118546	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	And if my prying eyes were to come across
anything... suspicious	 I'll be sure to keep
my mouth shut!
COOP118547	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Tomiyama cleaned every nook
and cranny of my house and
even cooked for me.
COOP118560	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	As always	 not a speck of dust in sight! Oh	
what a relief!
COOPHOME	AAAAAA==	Error: tnxotb-[000]

COOP40510	AAAAAA==	What kind of agreement?|What are you planning?
COOP40513	AAAAAA==	It sounds beneficial.
COOP40517	AAAAAA==	An idol?|Where'd that come from?
COOP40522	AAAAAA==	College or work?|Never thought about it.|A reasonable degree of happiness.
COOP40526	AAAAAA==	I explained as best I could	
but it still came out vague.
COOP40537	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Merope
growing deeper...
COOP40706	AAAAAA==	What happened?|What do you mean?
COOP40714	AAAAAA==	Idols again?|Not even once.|So do you just like idols then?
COOP40721	AAAAAA==	That makes sense I guess.|You seem very eager about this.
COOP40725	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Merope
growing deeper...
COOP40908	AAAAAA==	Do I have to?|Absolutely not.|Care to explain?
COOP40915	AAAAAA==	I don't think she's going to
let this go...
COOP40921	AAAAAA==	Looks like I'll have to go
along with this.
COOP40925	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Merope
growing deeper...
COOP41105	AAAAAA==	On-site?|What do you mean?
COOP41108	AAAAAA==	Why are we here?|Again with the idols...
COOP41125	AAAAAA==	They ran away.|You really want a photo	 huh?
COOP41128	AAAAAA==	I don't think that's why...
COOP41140	AAAAAA==	I should stop her.
COOP41141	AAAAAA==	Let's calm down.|You're scaring her.|Miss	 your time's up.
COOP41156	AAAAAA==	You sure that's all?|You just wanted to hang out more.
COOP41160	AAAAAA==	That's called being a fan.|Guess you're her fan now.
COOP41165	AAAAAA==	You just want to go.|Fine	 I'll tag along.
COOP41167	AAAAAA==	She ignored me.
COOP41168	AAAAAA==	However	 I feel my bond with

COOP41318	AAAAAA==	What the...|Explain.

COOP41334	AAAAAA==	That's deep.|What's the point?|You just want to order more.
COOP41355	AAAAAA==	You just want to go.|I am a little curious.
COOP41357	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Merope
growing deeper...
COOP41362	AAAAAA==	Merope seems dead set on this
photo session...
COOP41363	AAAAAA==	If I want to	 I can keep

accompany her.
COOP41504	AAAAAA==	What promise?|You mean the photo session?
COOP41508	AAAAAA==	Narumi's shoot is taking place
in this shop.
COOP41513	AAAAAA==	Sounds complicated.|Let's do our best.|You take the lead.

COOP41523	AAAAAA==	Merope is holding a fat stack

out the window.
COOP41537	AAAAAA==	Merope looks like she's on
cloud nine.
COOP41540	AAAAAA==	She has lots of tickets.|She has plenty of time left.
COOP41547	AAAAAA==	Despite the mishap	
Merope looks thrilled.
COOP41577	AAAAAA==	Merope looks proud of herself.

COOP41704	AAAAAA==	Land of idols?|Our Naruru awaits.

COOP41773	AAAAAA==	Sounds illegal.|Can you sue?
COOP41785	AAAAAA==	Why her?|Naruru might quit?
COOP41798	AAAAAA==	Narumi's coworkers returned
to the caf√©.
COOP41801	AAAAAA==	We'll make that villain pay.|Let's help Naruru!
COOP41809	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Merope

COOP41811	AAAAAA==	That's the man we saw at
Narumi's workplace.
COOP41812	AAAAAA==	It must be that
producer's Shadow.
COOP41816	AAAAAA==	We won't let you!|We're going to save Naruru!
COOP41820	AAAAAA==	You exploited their dreams.|Was that really your goal?
COOP41825	AAAAAA==	It's not too late.|You can still make things right.
COOP41829	AAAAAA==	He looks like he's had a
change of heart.
COOP41830	AAAAAA==	I should report back

COOP41851	AAAAAA==	The target should be in

COOP41852	AAAAAA==	Let's look around...
COOP41853	AAAAAA==	For Narumi and Merope's sake

COOP41854	AAAAAA==	Ready to go in?
COOP41855	AAAAAA==	Let's go.|Need to prepare first.
COOP41915	AAAAAA==	Great to hear things worked out.|I'm glad you feel better	 Naruru.

COOP49304	AAAAAA==	I headed out with Merope...
COOP49308	AAAAAA==	Not sure.|Maybe...?
COOP49315	AAAAAA==	You mean hold hands?|That's too early for us.
COOP49321	AAAAAA==	Merope and I chatted at the
planetarium. My heart raced
for more reasons than one.
COOP49322	AAAAAA==	Merope and I chatted at the
planetarium. She taught me
about the zodiac.
COOP49323	AAAAAA==	Merope and I chatted at the
planetarium. The couple next
to us flirted the whole time.
COOP49324	AAAAAA==	Merope and I chatted at the
planetarium. It was so
relaxing	 I nodded off.
COOP49325	AAAAAA==	Merope and I chatted at the
planetarium. She counted each
star one by one.
COOP49326	AAAAAA==	Merope and I chatted at the
planetarium. My thoughts
wandered to distant galaxies.
COOP49333	AAAAAA==	To get lost in a story.|To view a world outside reality.
COOP49342	AAAAAA==	That's a little melodramatic.|I never thought of it that way.
COOP49347	AAAAAA==	Merope and I watched a movie
together. We shared our
thoughts on it.
COOP49348	AAAAAA==	Merope and I watched a movie
together. She asked me
to explain the plot twist.
COOP49349	AAAAAA==	Merope and I watched a movie
together... and then another.
COOP49350	AAAAAA==	Merope and I watched a movie
together. We bought
souvenir pamphlets.
COOP49351	AAAAAA==	Merope and I watched
a movie together. She drank
all the soda...
COOP49352	AAAAAA==	Merope and I watched a movie
together. Her eyes were glued
to the idol actress.
COOP49363	AAAAAA==	I want to enjoy my youth.|You know	 the usual.
COOP49371	AAAAAA==	What do you mean?|I'll keep that in mind.
COOP49375	AAAAAA==	I only just managed to stop
Merope from barging into
the school...
COOP49376	AAAAAA==	I only just managed to stop
Merope from barging into
the school...
COOP49377	AAAAAA==	Merope and I walked around the
school grounds. I warned her
she can't drop by whenever.
COOP49378	AAAAAA==	Merope and I walked around the
school grounds. We bought
snacks on the way home.
COOP49379	AAAAAA==	Merope and I walked around the
school grounds. She suddenly
went for a run mid-tour.
COOP49380	AAAAAA==	Merope and I walked around the
school grounds. People thought
she was my older sister.
COOP49403	AAAAAA==	I only read manga.|Total bookworm.
COOP49410	AAAAAA==	Did you buy them here?|Don't tell me you're a regular...
COOP49414	AAAAAA==	Merope showed me around
Jinbocho. I found some old
manga I'd been looking for.
COOP49415	AAAAAA==	Merope showed me around
Jinbocho. I had to carry her
idol magazines...
COOP49416	AAAAAA==	Merope showed me around
Jinbocho. I learned all about
past idols.
COOP49417	AAAAAA==	Merope showed me around
Jinbocho. I bought books about
world mythology.
COOP49418	AAAAAA==	Merope showed me around
Jinbocho. We took a breather
to enjoy some delicious curry.
COOP49419	AAAAAA==	Merope showed me around
Jinbocho. I spotted the first
issue of a manga magazine.
COOP49435	AAAAAA==	My heart's racing.|Only with the right person.
COOP49439	AAAAAA==	I tried to explain to Merope
what makes riding a Ferris
wheel with somebody romantic.
COOP49443	AAAAAA==	Merope and I rode the Ferris
wheel. It was awkward.
COOP49444	AAAAAA==	Merope and I rode the Ferris
wheel. The kids in the next
gondola were staring at us.
COOP49445	AAAAAA==	Merope and I rode the Ferris
wheel. The view was nice	 but
it was mentally exhausting.
COOP49446	AAAAAA==	Merope and I rode the Ferris
wheel. We stared at each other
in silence.
COOP49447	AAAAAA==	Merope and I rode the Ferris
wheel. I had to stop her from
shaking the gondola.
COOP49448	AAAAAA==	Merope and I rode the Ferris
wheel. The operator stared at
us as we got on and off.
COOP49990	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that's right	 I have
something Merope might like...
COOP49991	AAAAAA==	Should I give this to Merope?
COOP49996	AAAAAA==	Maybe another time.
COOP49503	AAAAAA==	Sure.|I can't...
COOP49505	AAAAAA==	Merope and I went back to
my place.
COOP49552	AAAAAA==	Sleeping	 pretty much.|I don't want to say...
COOP49561	AAAAAA==	It's hard to relax there.|I can have some me time here.
COOP49570	AAAAAA==	Merope scanned the room from
top to bottom... It made me a
bit uneasy.
COOP49567	AAAAAA==	I relaxed in my room with
Merope. She pelted me with
questions	 but it was fun.
COOP49568	AAAAAA==	Seems like Merope wants to
say something. I should go
to the Velvet Room.
COOP49569	AAAAAA==	Seems like Merope has an
important matter to discuss. I
should go to the Velvet Room.
COOP49605	AAAAAA==	Entertain...?|Oh	 it's no biggie.
COOP49611	AAAAAA==	That was... something.|Maybe use some more emotion?
COOP49615	AAAAAA==	I-I'll have a water...|What else do you have?
COOP49617	AAAAAA==	She ignored my order...
COOP49620	AAAAAA==	Merope!!!|Do I have to say...?
COOP49625	AAAAAA==	I think I get how you feel.|It seemed... genuine.
COOP49628	AAAAAA==	Putting her methods aside	 I
could sense Merope was being
thoughtful... in her own way.
COOP49635	AAAAAA==	Photoshoot...?|Not this again...
COOP49641	AAAAAA==	You're still kinda flat.|I guess old habits die hard...
COOP49645	AAAAAA==	Pose?|H-How's this?|Way ahead of you!
COOP49650	AAAAAA==	I think I get how you feel.|We should've really taken one.
COOP49653	AAAAAA==	I got the sense that	 in her
own way	 Merope was being
thoughtful as always.
COOP50003	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 I've got time.|I'm busy...
COOP50012	AAAAAA==	With you?|Why?
COOP50019	AAAAAA==	Okay then.|If that's the case...
COOP50023	AAAAAA==	What'd you do for baseball?|What'd you do with Tomoko?
COOP50027	AAAAAA==	That's sweet.|Lots of good memories there	 huh?|Did you hit any home runs?
COOP50035	AAAAAA==	What's the matter?|Aren't you going inside?
COOP50042	AAAAAA==	Sure.|Let's do it.
COOP50045	AAAAAA==	Spending time with Motoha	
I feel hope rising
within me...
COOP50046	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP50050	AAAAAA==	I swung the bat while
listening to Motoha's advice.
COOP50202	AAAAAA==	I'd love to.|I'm kinda busy...
COOP50209	AAAAAA==	I see.|You got it.
COOP50218	AAAAAA==	What's wrong?|Earth to Motoha.
COOP50227	AAAAAA==	It won't.|It'll be okay.|Take your time.
COOP50246	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP50248	AAAAAA==	I parted ways with a
shaky-kneed Motoha.
COOP50402	AAAAAA==	Sounds like a plan.|Maybe when I'm less busy...
COOP50407	AAAAAA==	What are we doing here?|What's the plan	 Stan?
COOP50416	AAAAAA==	1 pound.|10 pounds.|200 pounds.
COOP50424	AAAAAA==	I can keep going.|I'm burnt out.
COOP50436	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP50439	AAAAAA==	You can count on it.|Sure thing.|Let's lift 200 lbs together.
COOP50444	AAAAAA==	Exhausted	 I parted ways
with Motoha.
COOP50602	AAAAAA==	It's a date.|Not right now...
COOP50607	AAAAAA==	To Inokashira Park?|To the batting cages?|To Chinatown?
COOP50614	AAAAAA==	Why are we at the diner?|We taking a break?
COOP50618	AAAAAA==	Your coach is here for you.|I've got my eye on you.
COOP50629	AAAAAA==	It's true.|Aren't you eating too much?|Let's work hard together.
COOP50633	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP50643	AAAAAA==	I walked with Motoha
to Zoshigaya.
COOP50802	AAAAAA==	How could I refuse?|I'm sorry	 I can't...
COOP50809	AAAAAA==	Give it your all!|No slacking off now!|Go for a home run!
COOP50816	AAAAAA==	The bat's making
contact	 but...
COOP50818	AAAAAA==	Her hitting power
seems limited...
COOP50819	AAAAAA==	It's still way better than the first time we
came here. She's only getting better.
COOP50840	AAAAAA==	What's the matter?|Do you know her?
COOP50866	AAAAAA==	Her supervisor.|Her friend.|Her boyfriend.
COOP50875	AAAAAA==	Calm down.|She's right.
COOP50893	AAAAAA==	You can win.|As long as you train...|You're an ace all-rounder.
COOP50900	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP50903	AAAAAA==	I trained at the batting cages
with Motoha.
COOP51002	AAAAAA==	Let's give it a swing.|Sorry	 got other plans...
COOP51007	AAAAAA==	How so?|No need to apologize.
COOP51012	AAAAAA==	I don't mind.|I got your back.
COOP51015	AAAAAA==	She's been swinging that bat
nonstop for about an hour.
COOP51016	AAAAAA==	Her precision is getting
worse	 but...
COOP51025	AAAAAA==	Motoha sure is serious
about this...
COOP51028	AAAAAA==	Yeah.|I'm not sure.|......
COOP51039	AAAAAA==	Motoha's working her butt off.
COOP51040	AAAAAA==	But I don't see her hitting
any home runs at this rate.
COOP51045	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP51048	AAAAAA==	Motoha and I left the
batting cages together.
COOP51202	AAAAAA==	Let's hit it!|I can't...
COOP51207	AAAAAA==	Motoha batted her all today.
COOP51208	AAAAAA==	But no home runs yet...
COOP51210	AAAAAA==	Stop!|Don't bother her.
COOP51212	AAAAAA==	Why are you obsessed with her?|You wanna beat her that bad?
COOP51220	AAAAAA==	That must have been back when
Motoha still admired Kiuchi...
COOP51228	AAAAAA==	......
COOP51239	AAAAAA==	......
COOP51240	AAAAAA==	I understand where she's
coming from	 but...
COOP51241	AAAAAA==	And what about how Motoha feels?|You're being selfish.
COOP51244	AAAAAA==	......
COOP51246	AAAAAA==	I want to help her.|On a whim.|She's my friend.
COOP51255	AAAAAA==	......
COOP51256	AAAAAA==	I've been talking for a while.
I should get back to Motoha.
COOP51259	AAAAAA==	Seems like she was really
immersed in her practice...
COOP51260	AAAAAA==	Judging by her expression	
I'm guessing she hasn't hit
any home runs yet.
COOP51261	AAAAAA==	I brought snacks!|Let's take a break.
COOP51263	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Motoha
growing deeper...
COOP51266	AAAAAA==	I left the batting cages with
Motoha	 who by all accounts is
pushing herself too hard.
COOP51404	AAAAAA==	Sure thing.|Maybe next time...
COOP51412	AAAAAA==	Seems she's been swinging
this whole time.
COOP51415	AAAAAA==	You are not a wreck.|Don't overdo it.
COOP51420	AAAAAA==	As your coach	 I disagree.|Taking breaks is important too.
COOP51423	AAAAAA==	Let's go!|Follow me.
COOP51425	AAAAAA==	Order whatever you like.|It's your cheat day.
COOP51427	AAAAAA==	You said cheat days are important.|Depriving yourself's worse for you.
COOP51430	AAAAAA==	What do you truly want out of this?|Why did you start exercising?
COOP51435	AAAAAA==	Do you hate baseball?|Do you want to continue baseball?|Are the Phantom Thieves important?
COOP51448	AAAAAA==	Well said.|I'm glad I asked.
COOP51452	AAAAAA==	Explain that to Tamayo.|Coach approves.
COOP51467	AAAAAA==	I should choose my next
words carefully...
COOP51468	AAAAAA==	Because we're a team.|Because you're important to me.
COOP51472	AAAAAA==	Motoha looks happy...
COOP51473	AAAAAA==	I feel a deep sense of trust
between me and Motoha...
COOP51476	AAAAAA==	I left the diner with Motoha.
COOP51479	AAAAAA==	Exactly what it sounds like.|Hmmm	 I wonder...
COOP51484	AAAAAA==	I am now in a relationship
with Motoha...
COOP51485	AAAAAA==	There's no turning back now...
COOP51486	AAAAAA==	I feel a deep sense of trust
between me and Motoha...
COOP51489	AAAAAA==	I escorted Motoha home.
COOP51491	AAAAAA==	I should choose my next
words carefully...
COOP51490	AAAAAA==	Because we're a team.|Because you're important to me.
COOP51603	AAAAAA==	Go with her|Decline
COOP51623	AAAAAA==	I'm rooting for you.|You've got this.
COOP51646	AAAAAA==	No.|Motoha chose this herself.
COOP51659	AAAAAA==	You did your best.|That was so cool.|No regrets?
COOP51668	AAAAAA==	I feel a deep sense of trust
between me and Motoha...
COOP51670	AAAAAA==	That's the spirit.|I'm counting on you.

COOP70027	AAAAAA==	I have a great idea! Let's say it belongs to
both of us!
COOP70028	AAAAAA==	And to that end...
COOP70029	AAAAAA==	I'll give you the right to decide what we do
with it!
COOP70030	AAAAAA==	Come on! Don't just stand there blinking at
me! Start throwing out some ideas!
COOP70031	AAAAAA==	Need a little smack in the head with this
stack of cash to get the juices flowing?
COOP70032	AAAAAA==	Three	 two	 one... Speak!
COOP70033	AAAAAA==	I want to make a farm.|Maybe grow something?|I'm too hungry to think straight.
COOP70034	AAAAAA==	A farm? You want to make our land into
a farm?
COOP70035	AAAAAA==	What a fantastic idea!
COOP70036	AAAAAA==	You would like to grow crops and such on
our land?
COOP70037	AAAAAA==	What a fantastic idea!
COOP70038	AAAAAA==	Oh	 you're hungry?
COOP70039	AAAAAA==	It'd be great if we could grow food here...
COOP70040	AAAAAA==	Food... Yes! That's certainly an interesting
idea.
COOP70041	AAAAAA==	It's settled	 then. We'll turn this land into
our farm!
COOP70042	AAAAAA==	You know	 I am actually quite confident in my
horticultural talents!
COOP70043	AAAAAA==	And what a huge plot! I can't wait to put it
to use!
COOP70044	AAAAAA==	Yui and I decided to create a
farm in the virtual world.
COOP70045	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP70046	AAAAAA==	Now that we've made our decision	 there's
much to be done!
COOP70047	AAAAAA==	I'll make sure to prepare all the tools we
need by the time we next meet.
COOP70048	AAAAAA==	Good day then! Until we meet again!
COOP70049	AAAAAA==	I promised to meet Yui again	
then logged out.
COOP70200	AAAAAA==	I wonder how the farm I
started with Yui is going.
COOP70201	AAAAAA==	Should I log in to
Harvest World Online?
COOP70202	AAAAAA==	Log in|Not today
COOP70203	AAAAAA==	I logged in to
Harvest World Online.
COOP70204	AAAAAA==	Maybe later.
COOP70205	AAAAAA==	I arrived at the field where
Yui and I promised to start
a farm together.
COOP61002	AAAAAA==	I can help.|I'm busy right now.
COOP61010	AAAAAA==	What's the other reason?|Tell me more.
COOP61016	AAAAAA==	So this is today's investigation?|We came here just for that?|You seem nervous today.
COOP61024	AAAAAA==	I understand.|Isn't this rude to the girl?|This case is unusually complex.
COOP61029	AAAAAA==	The door slid shut
on its own...
COOP61033	AAAAAA==	First	 calm down.|We have to find a way out.|Something's fishy about this.
COOP61041	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Kurotani
growing deeper...
COOP61047	AAAAAA==	I received a Rare Book
from Kurotani...
COOP61049	AAAAAA==	Kurotani and I parted ways
outside the Evil AV Room.
COOP61202	AAAAAA==	I'll help you.|I can't today.
COOP61217	AAAAAA==	We understand.|They're taking advantage of you.|I don't think that will work.
COOP61225	AAAAAA==	I guess.|It's not our call to make.|Let him do what he wants.
COOP61242	AAAAAA==	That was harsh.|He's had a lot on his mind.|Did he strike a nerve?
COOP61250	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Kurotani
growing deeper...
COOP61252	AAAAAA==	I received a Rare Book from
Kurotani and left the roof.
COOP61403	AAAAAA==	Let's talk.|Today isn't good for me.
COOP61416	AAAAAA==	You were pretty forceful with me.|Hence the kindred spirit thing?|That explains things.
COOP61423	AAAAAA==	That's not true.|So we're giving up?|Take's a whole nother issue.
COOP61430	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Kurotani
growing deeper...
COOP61437	AAAAAA==	But I'm already full...
COOP61438	AAAAAA==	I received a Rare Book
from Kurotani and left
the rooftop.
COOP61439	AAAAAA==	After consuming a
sickening amount of milk	
I left the rooftop.
COOP61601	AAAAAA==	I'll help.|I have plans today...
COOP61628	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP61633	AAAAAA==	It's because I'm his friend.|It's because I'm on his side.|It's because we're kindred spirits.
COOP61642	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP61644	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP61653	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Kurotani
growing deeper...
COOP61656	AAAAAA==	I received a Rare Book	
and parted ways with
Kurotani and Take.
COOP61801	AAAAAA==	Let's hear it.|Tell me another time.
COOP61811	AAAAAA==	Glad to hear it.|Hopefully it stays that way.|So no one's gonna lock us up again?
COOP61819	AAAAAA==	What have you learned?|So what is friendship	 really?|All thanks to Take.
COOP61828	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Kurotani...
COOP61833	AAAAAA==	I received a Rare Book
from Kurotani...
COOP61837	AAAAAA==	Kurotani and I talked
and drank milk to
our hearts' content.
COOP70206	AAAAAA==	The ground is already plowed
and ready for sowing. Did Yui
do all this?
COOP70207	AAAAAA==	Hey there! Where've you been?
COOP70208	AAAAAA==	While you were away	 I prepared the plot for
farming.
COOP70209	AAAAAA==	With this tractor!
COOP70210	AAAAAA==	Now it's fields and fields as far as the eye
can see! Isn't it amazing!?
COOP70211	AAAAAA==	Looks great.|I think that's enough plowing.|Let's till the whole world!
COOP70212	AAAAAA==	Let's keep it up and grow this farm bigger
and bigger!
COOP70213	AAAAAA==	Since you're finally here	 I'd like us to
plant something today.
COOP70214	AAAAAA==	You may be right about that!
COOP70215	AAAAAA==	What a shame. I wanted to ride the tractor a
little longer.
COOP70216	AAAAAA==	My! For someone with such a stoic face	
you're pretty ambitious!
COOP70217	AAAAAA==	But tilling alone won't make our crops grow.
COOP70218	AAAAAA==	So	 what should we plant first?
COOP70219	AAAAAA==	Something tasty.|Something filling.|Something easy to grow.
COOP70220	AAAAAA==	Then let's go with cyber potatoes! With good
soil	 they shouldn't need much tending.
COOP70221	AAAAAA==	Best of all	 potatoes are both delicious and
filling!
COOP70222	AAAAAA==	Now let's head to town and buy seeds!
COOP70223	AAAAAA==	I'll drive! Come sit in the passenger
seat	 um...
COOP70224	AAAAAA==	I guess I haven't asked your name yet.
COOP70225	AAAAAA==	I see you haven't set one either.
COOP70226	AAAAAA==	Did you have trouble deciding?
COOP70227	AAAAAA==	Well	 until you do	 I'll think up a temporary
name for you!
COOP70228	AAAAAA==	Hmmm... You grow potatoes	 so you can be...
Potato-kun!
COOP70229	AAAAAA==	Uh	 maybe not.
COOP70230	AAAAAA==	How about Russet? That's a kind of potato.
COOP70231	AAAAAA==	Plus	 it kind of sounds like it could be a
name anyway.
COOP70232	AAAAAA==	I like it.|It's embarrassing.|I wanna be a more luxurious potato.
COOP70233	AAAAAA==	That's the most important thing! Happy to
work with you	 Russet.
COOP70234	AAAAAA==	There's nothing embarrassing about russets.
You should wear that potato with pride!
COOP70235	AAAAAA==	Russets aren't good enough for you? You
really are ambitious!
COOP70236	AAAAAA==	However	 we've only just begun our farming
journey. We shouldn't aim too high just yet.
COOP70237	AAAAAA==	Now that we've decided what to call you...
COOP70238	AAAAAA==	Let's head to town together! Russet	 hop into
the passenger seat	 if you please!
COOP70239	AAAAAA==	Great! We got ourselves some excellent seeds!
Now we need to buy fertilizer.
COOP70240	AAAAAA==	Oh! You there...
COOP70243	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that's a shame. I would've liked to have
a chat...
COOP70244	AAAAAA==	Ah! That's right! The fertilizer store! I'll
be right back.
COOP70249	AAAAAA==	Sorry for the wait! I got the fertilizer!
COOP70250	AAAAAA==	Oh? Were you two having a conversation?
COOP70251	AAAAAA==	I'm sorry. I didn't get in the way	 did I?
COOP70252	AAAAAA==	Thank goodness. That person is rather timid	
you know!
COOP70253	AAAAAA==	Now that we have everything we need	 it's
time to head back to the farm!
COOP70254	AAAAAA==	Did something happen between
Yui and that guy?
COOP70255	AAAAAA==	Wait	 I shouldn't stick
my nose in other
people's business.
COOP70256	AAAAAA==	Russet! I'm setting this down here!
COOP70257	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP70258	AAAAAA==	The two of us chatted
while planting seeds	
then I logged off.
COOP70400	AAAAAA==	I wonder how the fields
are doing.
COOP70401	AAAAAA==	Should I log in to
Harvest World Online?
COOP70402	AAAAAA==	Log on|Next time
COOP70403	AAAAAA==	I logged on to
Harvest World Online.
COOP70404	AAAAAA==	Maybe next time.
COOP70405	AAAAAA==	Looks like our seeds haven't
sprouted yet.
COOP70406	AAAAAA==	Where's Yui?
COOP70407	AAAAAA==	Sorry to keep you waiting!
COOP70408	AAAAAA==	Our field is rather large	 so I went to buy
us this big hose!
COOP70409	AAAAAA==	It sprays water quite well	 although it is a
little difficult to control.
COOP70410	AAAAAA==	Ah!
COOP70411	AAAAAA==	I'm sorry about that. Good thing you have
sharp reflexes.
COOP70412	AAAAAA==	Now our seeds have plenty of water!
COOP70413	AAAAAA==	They should start to sprout before long!
COOP70414	AAAAAA==	You have experience with plants?|That's all we have to do?
COOP70415	AAAAAA==	Well	 caring for crops in this world is much
easier than it is in real life.
COOP70416	AAAAAA==	Actual farming is much more difficult	
I assure you.
COOP70417	AAAAAA==	Weather is always a factor	 and then there's
the insects!
COOP70418	AAAAAA==	Ugh	 insects... Just thinking about them
gives me the creeps!
COOP70419	AAAAAA==	But if we hadn't met...
COOP70420	AAAAAA==	I never would've thought to turn this land
into a farm.
COOP70421	AAAAAA==	Can I tell you something?
COOP70422	AAAAAA==	Back when things were a little livelier
around here...
COOP70423	AAAAAA==	I had the opportunity to meet lots of new
people every day.
COOP70424	AAAAAA==	I'd try to talk to them whenever I could.
COOP70425	AAAAAA==	But after chatting for a while	 I'd never see
them again!
COOP70426	AAAAAA==	There was that guy the other
day who seemed to know Yui...
COOP70428	AAAAAA==	The person we met in town the other day was
one of them.
COOP70429	AAAAAA==	Don't worry about the past.|Did you have some kind of argument?|Do you want to apologize?
COOP70430	AAAAAA==	I'm not worried about it. We've bumped into
each other a few times before.
COOP70431	AAAAAA==	Maybe after some time has passed	 we'll be
able to talk like we used to.
COOP70432	AAAAAA==	Nothing in particular comes to mind.
COOP70433	AAAAAA==	That said	 perhaps I upset him somehow
without realizing it.
COOP70434	AAAAAA==	It doesn't seem like I've done anything to
warrant apologizing.
COOP70435	AAAAAA==	I've asked him as much before	 and he said
everything was fine.
COOP70436	AAAAAA==	I do have some idea of what could be the
matter...
COOP70437	AAAAAA==	But if I can't be myself	 then there's no
point in me being here!
COOP70438	AAAAAA==	For a while I thought it might be easier for
me to play alone.
COOP70439	AAAAAA==	But it's so much more fun having someone to
talk to!
COOP70440	AAAAAA==	Let's talk a lot from now on.|If you want someone to talk to...|You sure you're fine with me?
COOP70441	AAAAAA==	*gasp*
COOP70442	AAAAAA==	I'm so happy to hear you say that!
COOP70443	AAAAAA==	Yes! I'd like to continue talking with you
and cultivating the fields together!
COOP70444	AAAAAA==	Of course! Meeting you reminded me how fun it
is to spend time with other people.
COOP70445	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP70446	AAAAAA==	Oh no! The soil is drying out!
COOP70447	AAAAAA==	We must hydrate the fields. Come along	
Russet!
COOP70448	AAAAAA==	I'll hold the end of the hose. You support
the middle	 Russet!
COOP70449	AAAAAA==	The two of us talked while
watering the fields	
then I logged out.
COOP70600	AAAAAA==	I wonder if the crops
I planted with Yui
are doing all right.
COOP70601	AAAAAA==	Should I log in to
Harvest World Online?
COOP70602	AAAAAA==	Sign in|Not today
COOP70603	AAAAAA==	I signed in to
Harvest World Online.
COOP70604	AAAAAA==	I'll play another time.
COOP70605	AAAAAA==	The crops are sprouting!
COOP70606	AAAAAA==	Exhilarating!
COOP70607	AAAAAA==	Yui doesn't seem to have
noticed me. Should I
call out to her?
COOP70608	AAAAAA==	This feels great!
COOP70609	AAAAAA==	Oh	 hello there	 Russet!
COOP70610	AAAAAA==	That looks fun.|What are you doing?|Is that a bazooka?
COOP70611	AAAAAA==	It is! Very much so! Would you like to try	
Russet?
COOP70612	AAAAAA==	Oh	 what a shame. We've run out of
fertilizer.
COOP70613	AAAAAA==	Exactly what it looks like! I'm spraying
fertilizer!
COOP70614	AAAAAA==	Isn't it wonderful? I bought it in town!
COOP70615	AAAAAA==	As you can see	 our cyber potatoes have
begun sprouting.
COOP70616	AAAAAA==	I want them to grow big and strong	 so I've
started adding fertilizer.
COOP70617	AAAAAA==	Vegetables need nutrients to grow just like
people do!
COOP70618	AAAAAA==	Oh	 I can't wait till they're ready! We'll
have ourselves the largest cyber potatoes
ever!
COOP70619	AAAAAA==	What do you think we should cook with them!?
COOP70620	AAAAAA==	Are there any potato dishes you're
particularly fond of	 Russet?
COOP70621	AAAAAA==	French fries.|Meat and potatoes.|Baked potato.
COOP70622	AAAAAA==	Wow! What a coincidence!
COOP70623	AAAAAA==	Soft	 fluffy potatoes infused with the rich
flavor of the broth...
COOP70624	AAAAAA==	Just picturing it makes me smile.
COOP70625	AAAAAA==	Oh	 I always buy that from food stands.
COOP70626	AAAAAA==	I recommend trying it with salted squid
on top.
COOP70627	AAAAAA==	I love french fries so much.
COOP70628	AAAAAA==	When they're freshly fried	 crisp on the
outside	 and fluffy on the inside!
COOP70629	AAAAAA==	That perfect combination of sweet and salty
starch is irresistible!
COOP70630	AAAAAA==	Oh my. I'm getting a bit too excited.
COOP70631	AAAAAA==	I've gone to hamburger shops just to order
fries before.
COOP70632	AAAAAA==	Speaking of burgers...
COOP70633	AAAAAA==	There's a restaurant in Shibuya that sells
enormous ones.
COOP70634	AAAAAA==	My friend told me that she wants to go but
doesn't have anyone to go with her.
COOP70635	AAAAAA==	From the look on your face	 I guess you're
wondering why I don't go.
COOP70636	AAAAAA==	Unfortunately	 that's not possible.
COOP70637	AAAAAA==	Hmmm	 how should I put this?
COOP70638	AAAAAA==	My friend and I share the same body...
COOP70639	AAAAAA==	So... you're the friend?|She's you in real life?
COOP70640	AAAAAA==	No	 it's a friend of mine!
COOP70641	AAAAAA==	Russet	 if it's not too much trouble...
COOP70642	AAAAAA==	Would you mind going to the burger shop with
my friend?
COOP70643	AAAAAA==	Of course	 you're free to refuse!
COOP70644	AAAAAA==	......
COOP70645	AAAAAA==	I decided to accept
her invitation.
COOP70646	AAAAAA==	*gasp*
COOP70647	AAAAAA==	Thank you! I'm sure my friend will be
thrilled!
COOP70648	AAAAAA==	My friend loves french fries too	 so she'll
be looking forward to it!
COOP70649	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP70650	AAAAAA==	Please show my friend a good time! Goodbye!
COOP70651	AAAAAA==	I promised to go to the
burger shop in Shibuya
with Yui's "friend."
COOP70652	AAAAAA==	Maybe I should message her.
COOP70800	AAAAAA==	I made a promise to meet
Yui's friend in person.
COOP70801	AAAAAA==	Maybe we should meet up today.
COOP70802	AAAAAA==	Invite|Not today
COOP70803	AAAAAA==	I sent a message to Yui asking
if her friend wants to go to
the burger shop today.
COOP70804	AAAAAA==	She replied right away.
Apparently	 her friend
said yes.
COOP70805	AAAAAA==	Off to Shibuya.
COOP70806	AAAAAA==	Maybe not today.
COOP70807	AAAAAA==	I arrived at the burger shop.
I wonder if that woman
is Yui's "friend."
COOP70809	AAAAAA==	Yui-san?|Are you a french fry fan?|I'm Russet.
COOP70823	AAAAAA==	Nice to meet you.|An office worker?|How's Yui?
COOP70838	AAAAAA==	The large portions made it
a struggle	 but we finished
our meal.
COOP70853	AAAAAA==	Through Musubi	 I feel my bond
with Yui growing deeper...
COOP70857	AAAAAA==	Sounds tough.|Give my regards to Yui.|Thanks for the burger.
COOP70863	AAAAAA==	We left the burger shop	
and parted ways.
COOP70864	AAAAAA==	I told her my name.
COOP71000	AAAAAA==	I wonder how our crops
are doing.
COOP71001	AAAAAA==	Should I log in to
Harvest World Online?
COOP71002	AAAAAA==	Play|Don't
COOP71003	AAAAAA==	I booted up
Harvest World Online.
COOP71004	AAAAAA==	I'll hold off for now.
COOP71005	AAAAAA==	The leaves are growing nice
and large. The fertilizer
must be working.
COOP71006	AAAAAA==	Grow	 grow	 potatoes! Grow	 grow!
COOP71007	AAAAAA==	I know you can do better than that! Let me
see your budding potential!
COOP71008	AAAAAA==	Oh! Hello there	 Russet.
COOP71009	AAAAAA==	Working hard?|What are you doing?|Pumping up the potatoes?
COOP71010	AAAAAA==	Yes! Real farm work takes grit!
COOP68704	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP68706	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP68710	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP68719	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP68728	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP68730	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP71011	AAAAAA==	What does it look like? I'm helping the
potatoes grow!
COOP71012	AAAAAA==	Yes! I'm trying to get them to turn over a
new leaf!
COOP71013	AAAAAA==	You see	 their leaves haven't been growing
well lately.
COOP71014	AAAAAA==	I wonder why. I've been giving them plenty of
water and fertilizer...
COOP71015	AAAAAA==	C'mon	 potatoes! Get it together already.
COOP71016	AAAAAA==	Oh no! The roots are weak!
COOP71017	AAAAAA==	Here too!? There too!? Why is this
happening!?
COOP71018	AAAAAA==	At this rate	 they'll wither and die before
we get to harvest them!
COOP71019	AAAAAA==	Do they need more water?|Is it the wrong fertilizer?|Is it pests?
COOP71020	AAAAAA==	The soil is moist	 so that shouldn't be it.
COOP71021	AAAAAA==	Too much water can be bad for the crops
anyway. It must be something else.
COOP71022	AAAAAA==	It's fertilizer made specifically for cyber
potatoes	 so that can't be the case.
COOP71023	AAAAAA==	It must be something else.
COOP71024	AAAAAA==	Pests? That must be it!
COOP71025	AAAAAA==	It is!
COOP71026	AAAAAA==	Look at this. Bite marks on the roots!
COOP71027	AAAAAA==	We may be dealing with potato moles here!
COOP71028	AAAAAA==	They eat the roots of young cyber potatoes.
COOP71029	AAAAAA==	But we caught on to them too late.
COOP71030	AAAAAA==	I inspected the crops with
Yui. The damage has spread
to the entire field.
COOP71031	AAAAAA==	Why...?
COOP71032	AAAAAA==	Why does trouble follow me wherever I go!?
COOP71033	AAAAAA==	We can fix this.|Don't get discouraged.
COOP71034	AAAAAA==	Thank you for trying to cheer me up	 Russet.
You're very kind.
COOP71035	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP71036	AAAAAA==	But...
COOP71037	AAAAAA==	I don't think I can take much more than this.
Sorry	 I'll have to call it a day.
COOP71038	AAAAAA==	Yui seems really down.
COOP71039	AAAAAA==	I wonder if there's anything
I can do to help.
COOP71040	AAAAAA==	......
COOP71041	AAAAAA==	After getting rid of the
moles	 I gave the potatoes
more fertilizer.
COOP71042	AAAAAA==	I'll make sure to come back
and tend the fields regularly.
COOP71200	AAAAAA==	I wonder how the crops
are doing lately.
COOP71201	AAAAAA==	Should I check out
Harvest World Online?
COOP71202	AAAAAA==	Go online|Hold off for now
COOP71203	AAAAAA==	I signed on to
Harvest World Online.
COOP71204	AAAAAA==	Maybe not today.
COOP71205	AAAAAA==	It looks like Yui hasn't
visited our field since the
last time I saw her.
COOP71206	AAAAAA==	I'll tend to the fields
on my own.
COOP71207	AAAAAA==	Seems like the potato moles
won't be coming back.
COOP71208	AAAAAA==	The farm's going to be
just fine.
COOP71209	AAAAAA==	Huh!?
COOP71210	AAAAAA==	Wh-What's going on here!?
COOP71211	AAAAAA==	They're not withering! They're growing
healthily again!
COOP71212	AAAAAA==	Long time no see.|How have you been?
COOP71213	AAAAAA==	Hello. It's been a while.
COOP71214	AAAAAA==	But never mind that! Look at the farm! Did
you do all this yourself?
COOP71215	AAAAAA==	How!?
COOP71216	AAAAAA==	I told Yui that I got rid
of the moles while
she was offline.
COOP71217	AAAAAA==	You scared off the moles with high-pitched
sound waves? Where did you get that idea?
COOP71218	AAAAAA==	Asked other farmers.|Gathered info in town.|I wanted to make you happy.
COOP71219	AAAAAA==	Other farmers	 huh?
COOP71220	AAAAAA==	It's true moles have sensitive eardrums	 so
high frequency noises can drive them away.
COOP71221	AAAAAA==	We used to do the same thing at our farm back
home! Well done	 Russet!
COOP71222	AAAAAA==	Did the clerk from the shop where I bought
the fertilizer tell you?
COOP71223	AAAAAA==	If they sell fertilizer	 they must know a lot
about pests too! Good thinking!
COOP71224	AAAAAA==	Oh!
COOP71225	AAAAAA==	So you kept trying until it worked out?
COOP71226	AAAAAA==	Amazing job	 Russet!
COOP71227	AAAAAA==	The leaves are healthier than ever.
COOP71228	AAAAAA==	They must be growing so quickly because the
moles are gone.
COOP71229	AAAAAA==	Why	 just looking at these healthy potatoes
makes me feel so much better!
COOP71230	AAAAAA==	I'm really sorry	 Russet.
COOP71231	AAAAAA==	I had some stuff going on that prevented me
from checking on the fields for a while.
COOP71232	AAAAAA==	But from now on	 I'll try to make time every
day to keep our crops healthy!
COOP71233	AAAAAA==	I mean	 it's the least I can do after you
worked so hard to save them!
COOP71234	AAAAAA==	Besides	 I'm not the type to mope around
forever!
COOP71235	AAAAAA==	Let's work on it together.|I dunno about every day...|We might have trouble again.
COOP71236	AAAAAA==	Hehe	 that makes me happy. But don't overdo
it	 okay?
COOP71237	AAAAAA==	This place is for us to unwind. It'd be no
fun if we forced ourselves.
COOP71238	AAAAAA==	You can come and check things out when it's
convenient for you!
COOP71239	AAAAAA==	I'll be waiting!
COOP71240	AAAAAA==	If that happens	 I'll be the one to deal with
it next time!
COOP71241	AAAAAA==	I can't let you do all the work	 Russet!
COOP71242	AAAAAA==	Oh no! I forgot something important!
COOP71243	AAAAAA==	I haven't thanked you for all you've done.
COOP71244	AAAAAA==	Thank you so much	 Russet. I'm really glad
we're working on this farm together.
COOP71245	AAAAAA==	The potatoes would have withered if you
weren't here.
COOP71246	AAAAAA==	But with us working together	 we can tackle
anything that comes our way.
COOP71247	AAAAAA==	And it's much more fun with the two of us!
COOP71248	AAAAAA==	Yui seems like she's back
to her old self.
COOP71249	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP71251	AAAAAA==	I feel a deep sense of trust
between me and Yui...
COOP71250	AAAAAA==	We tended the fields together	
then logged out.
COOP71400	AAAAAA==	I wonder how our potatoes are.
COOP71401	AAAAAA==	Should I hang out in
Harvest World Online?
COOP71402	AAAAAA==	Join the game|Maybe another time
COOP71403	AAAAAA==	I went on to
Harvest World Online.
COOP71404	AAAAAA==	I think I'll pass.
COOP71405	AAAAAA==	Where's Yui?
COOP71406	AAAAAA==	She doesn't seem to be around.
I should look for her.
COOP71407	AAAAAA==	Nothing has been planted
in this area yet.
COOP71408	AAAAAA==	No signs of Yui here.
COOP71409	AAAAAA==	A helicopter is heading
this way!
COOP71411	AAAAAA==	That was my first time riding one of those!
It was exhilarating to say the least!
COOP71412	AAAAAA==	Seems fun.|What were you doing?|Where'd you get a helicopter?
COOP71413	AAAAAA==	Do you want to take it for a ride later?
Looking down at the whole field is such fun!
COOP71414	AAAAAA==	Scattering seeds	 of course!
COOP71415	AAAAAA==	I rented it!
COOP71416	AAAAAA==	We haven't planted anything here yet	 so I
was scattering cyber watermelon seeds.
COOP71417	AAAAAA==	I learned my lesson from the whole potato
debacle.
COOP71418	AAAAAA==	Of course it's important to take measures to
protect our fields	 but...
COOP71419	AAAAAA==	I think if we also plant a variety of
different crops	 they'll have a better chance
of surviving.
COOP71420	AAAAAA==	Like	 even if the potato moles come back	
the watermelons shouldn't be affected.
COOP71421	AAAAAA==	Surely	 they're called potato moles for a
reason	 right!?
COOP71422	AAAAAA==	Makes sense.|I don't think that's...|Classic Yui.
COOP71423	AAAAAA==	Right? Glad we're on the same page!
COOP71424	AAAAAA==	Of course it makes sense! Don't think about
it too hard!
COOP71425	AAAAAA==	I'm really happy to hear you say that!
COOP71426	AAAAAA==	I really feel best when I'm true to myself!
COOP71427	AAAAAA==	But I haven't neglected to prepare a defense
strategy either!
COOP71428	AAAAAA==	After doing some research	 I learned that
cyber watermelon plants attract insects.
COOP71429	AAAAAA==	So once they start growing	 we'll need to
cover them up to keep them protected.
COOP71430	AAAAAA==	And wouldn't you know it? I have just the
thing we need!
COOP71431	AAAAAA==	Perfect.|Will that be enough?|Insects	 huh...
COOP71432	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 we won't have a repeat of the potato
incident on my watch.
COOP71433	AAAAAA==	Once the fruits start to grow	 we'll cover
them up together!
COOP71434	AAAAAA==	Of course	 we should always expect the
unexpected.
COOP71435	AAAAAA==	But I'm sure the two of us can deal with
whatever comes our way.
COOP71436	AAAAAA==	Oh	 you look sullen. Do you hate insects?
COOP71437	AAAAAA==	Musubi does too!
COOP71438	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that reminds me. Have you ever grown
plants in real life	 Russet?
COOP71439	AAAAAA==	Really? I'd love to see you in action!
COOP71440	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Yui
growing deeper...
COOP71441	AAAAAA==	Musubi also seems interested in growing
plants.
COOP71442	AAAAAA==	But she struggles with insects	 doesn't she?
COOP71443	AAAAAA==	Even though she can face them in-game	 she
doesn't think she can handle real insects!
COOP71444	AAAAAA==	If you ever meet with Musubi again	 try to
give her some encouragement.
COOP71445	AAAAAA==	Her work has calmed down a little	 so she has
a bit of downtime now.
COOP71446	AAAAAA==	If I go to Shibuya	 I might
be able to see Matsukata.
Maybe I'll go soon.
COOP71447	AAAAAA==	We both logged out
after tending to the
fields together.
COOP71600	AAAAAA==	It's from Yui.
COOP71601	AAAAAA==	Yui's "friend" Matsukata
is wondering if we can
meet in Shibuya.
COOP71602	AAAAAA==	Head to Shibuya|Decline
COOP71603	AAAAAA==	I decided to go and meet
with Matsukata...
COOP71604	AAAAAA==	I have other things to do	
so I told Yui I'm busy.
COOP71626	AAAAAA==	Of course.|If you think I can help.
COOP71631	AAAAAA==	Get something low effort.|Take sunlight into account.|Pick something that speaks to you.
COOP71647	AAAAAA==	Do your best.|You're not worried about bugs?
COOP71656	AAAAAA==	Through Musubi	 I feel my bond
with Yui growing deeper...
COOP71663	AAAAAA==	We promised to meet again
online	 then I walked her
to the ticket gate.
COOP71664	AAAAAA==	It's from Yui.
COOP71665	AAAAAA==	I decided to go and meet
with Matsukata...
COOP71800	AAAAAA==	I wonder how the farm
is doing.
COOP71801	AAAAAA==	Should I log on to
Harvest World Online?
COOP71802	AAAAAA==	Go|Don't
COOP71803	AAAAAA==	I entered
Harvest World Online.
COOP71804	AAAAAA==	I'll play another day.
COOP71805	AAAAAA==	The crops seem to be
growing well.
COOP71806	AAAAAA==	That sounded like an
explosion. I should
go check it out.
COOP71807	AAAAAA==	Oh	 hello there	 Russet. Your timing couldn't
be better!
COOP71808	AAAAAA==	For what?|What are you up to?|I heard an explosion.
COOP71809	AAAAAA==	To check out this huge plot of land!
COOP71810	AAAAAA==	I've been expanding our land!
COOP71811	AAAAAA==	Of course you did. I was blowing things up!
COOP71812	AAAAAA==	I found myself wanting a bigger field for us!
COOP71813	AAAAAA==	So I'm blowing up the mountains to make
more land!
COOP71814	AAAAAA==	By the way	 I heard from Musubi that her
basil is growing nicely.
COOP71815	AAAAAA==	Her success has motivated me to work
harder too!
COOP71816	AAAAAA==	Unfortunately	 it sounds like she hasn't been
as successful in training her junior.
COOP71817	AAAAAA==	But she said she's not going to dwell on it	
and she won't let that kind of stuff hold her
back anymore!
COOP71818	AAAAAA==	After all	 it's only natural to experience
setbacks when doing things you struggle with.
COOP71819	AAAAAA==	I	 too	 have had a lot of trouble with
interpersonal relationships in the past.
COOP71820	AAAAAA==	But because I didn't give up	 and I reached
out to you	 now here we are!
COOP71821	AAAAAA==	To be perfectly honest	 it took a lot of
courage to call out to you back then.
COOP71822	AAAAAA==	It's all thanks to you to that Musubi and I
are where we are today	 Russet.
COOP71823	AAAAAA==	From the bottom of my heart	 thank you.
COOP71824	AAAAAA==	You've worked really hard.|I just gave you a push.|Call me Yukon Gold from now on.
COOP71825	AAAAAA==	Thank you. Musubi and I are both trying our
hardest.
COOP71826	AAAAAA==	But that's only possible because of all the
support you've given us.
COOP71827	AAAAAA==	How could we not give it our all when you're
here cheering us on?
COOP71828	AAAAAA==	Hehehe	 no need to be so humble. Please	
accept my thanks.
COOP71829	AAAAAA==	You may think of it as a mere push	 but it
was a huge step forward for me!
COOP71830	AAAAAA==	Ah	 you're still aiming for a richer title?
COOP71831	AAAAAA==	Perhaps we should promote you beyond gold.
How does Jewel Yam sound? Or perhaps	 Garnet
Sweet Potato?
COOP71832	AAAAAA==	Hmmm. I've gotten so used to Russet	
nothing else seems to fit quite as well.
COOP71833	AAAAAA==	I think it's best you remain Russet. But for
your efforts	 I'll help you expand your
territory!
COOP71834	AAAAAA==	In fact	 I'll do you one better.
COOP71835	AAAAAA==	After expanding this plot further...
COOP71836	AAAAAA==	I'd like us to start growing things other
than crops too.
COOP71837	AAAAAA==	We'll fill this place with nature	 just like
Musubi's hometown!
COOP71838	AAAAAA==	You'll help me	 won't you?
COOP71839	AAAAAA==	Gladly.|If I must.
COOP71840	AAAAAA==	I thought you'd say that!
COOP71841	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Yui...
COOP71842	AAAAAA==	Now that that's decided	 let's get expanding!
COOP71843	AAAAAA==	Helmets on	 Russet!
COOP71844	AAAAAA==	I logged out after blowing up
some mountains with Yui.
COOP71853	AAAAAA==	Seems like I can play it on
the game console in my room.
Maybe I should try it out...
COOP72000	AAAAAA==	This is where I always do my shopping!
COOP72001	AAAAAA==	It's pretty small	 but it has everything
you need.
COOP72002	AAAAAA==	So	 any of the shops catch your eye?
COOP72003	AAAAAA==	I want to change my outfit.|What would you recommend?
COOP72004	AAAAAA==	Let's visit my favorite avatar shop	 then!
COOP72005	AAAAAA==	That place's full of cute clothes!
COOP72006	AAAAAA==	Me? Well... how about that jeweler?
COOP72007	AAAAAA==	They sell loads of sparkly and dazzling
accessories!
COOP72008	AAAAAA==	Oh	 you don't look impressed. Not your cup
of tea I'm guessing?
COOP72009	AAAAAA==	We can give it a shot.|Sorry	 not my kind of thing.
COOP72010	AAAAAA==	Yay! Off we go!
COOP72011	AAAAAA==	Don't knock it till you try it!
COOP72012	AAAAAA==	I'll pick out something perfect for you.
COOP72013	AAAAAA==	After that	 we can go eat somewhere!
COOP72014	AAAAAA==	Hehehe	 shopping with someone else is so fun!
COOP72015	AAAAAA==	Let the super fun shopping spree begin! Which
store shall we visit today?
COOP72016	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored a nearby
town. We checked out
the avatar shop.
COOP72017	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored a nearby
town. We shopped for
interior decor.
COOP72018	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored a nearby
town. We looked around
the cyber produce shop.
COOP72019	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored a nearby
town. We found a rare
cyber fruit.
COOP72020	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored a nearby
town. We stumbled upon a
flea market at the square.
COOP72030	AAAAAA==	I'll show you around the snowfields today!
COOP72031	AAAAAA==	It snows here all year long!
COOP72032	AAAAAA==	That means you can try out winter sports like
skiing and snowboarding.
COOP72033	AAAAAA==	You can even rent a snowmobile if you want!
COOP72034	AAAAAA==	So	 what do you want to do now?
COOP72035	AAAAAA==	Ride a snowmobile.|Winter sports.|Let's build a snow fort!
COOP72036	AAAAAA==	What a coincidence! I was just craving a
little snow-racing adventure!
COOP72037	AAAAAA==	Let's go rent one now!
COOP72038	AAAAAA==	All righty then! Let's go rent some boards!
COOP72039	AAAAAA==	Then we'll get on the lift and make our way
to the summit...
COOP72040	AAAAAA==	And from there	 we'll shred our way down to
the bottom!
COOP72041	AAAAAA==	A snow fort? That's not a bad idea!
COOP72042	AAAAAA==	This cold weather is making me crave oranges.
Oh look	 they're selling cyber mandarins
over there!
COOP72043	AAAAAA==	We should go buy some!
COOP72044	AAAAAA==	Come on! Hurry up!
COOP72045	AAAAAA==	Ah!
COOP72046	AAAAAA==	I slipped... Could you help me up?
COOP72047	AAAAAA==	No matter when you go	 this place is always
a breathtaking silver snowscape! Now what
shall we do today?
COOP72048	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored the
snowfields. We tried out
some winter sports.
COOP72049	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored the
snowfields. We made a
giant snowman together.
COOP72050	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored the
snowfields. We went for a
wild ride on a snowmobile.
COOP72051	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored the
snowfields. After an intense
snowfight	 we were exhausted.
COOP72052	AAAAAA==	Yui and I explored the
snowfields. Cyber buds were
sprouting from the snow.
COOP72060	AAAAAA==	This town is far from the farm	 so I don't
come here often	 but...
COOP72061	AAAAAA==	You can find some pretty rare seeds here.
COOP72062	AAAAAA==	Hey	 look at these! Cyber cauliflower seeds!
COOP72063	AAAAAA==	They have cyber horned melon and cyber
artichoke seeds too!
COOP72064	AAAAAA==	Wanna buy some?|They look hard to grow.
COOP72065	AAAAAA==	Hmmm	 as amazing as that sounds...
COOP72066	AAAAAA==	I don't think we can grow them on our farm.
COOP72067	AAAAAA==	We don't have the right climate for these
to grow.
COOP72068	AAAAAA==	The area we're in now seems to be the perfect
climate for them	 though.
COOP72069	AAAAAA==	Look. The sign says	 "for advanced
horticulturists only."
COOP72070	AAAAAA==	We're really gonna have to put our backs into
it at the farm if we wanna reach that level!
COOP72071	AAAAAA==	I have a great idea!
COOP72072	AAAAAA==	Let's expand our farm to this area someday!
COOP72073	AAAAAA==	Then we'll be able to grow the exotic seeds
sold here!
COOP72074	AAAAAA==	Why	 it's a wonderful idea if I do say so
myself!
COOP72075	AAAAAA==	C'mon	 Russet	 hurry up! I wanna check out
that store!
COOP72076	AAAAAA==	Yui and I visited a remote
town. We checked out
a newly-opened shop.
COOP72077	AAAAAA==	Yui and I visited a remote
town. We bought some new
cyber veggies.
COOP72078	AAAAAA==	Yui and I visited a remote
town. We discussed a plan
to expand the farm.
COOP72079	AAAAAA==	Yui and I visited a remote
town. We watched street
performers in the square.
COOP72080	AAAAAA==	Yui and I visited a remote
town. We participated in
an event.
COOP72090	AAAAAA==	Today	 I'll teach you how to operate the
vehicles in this world!
COOP72091	AAAAAA==	Since you're new to all this	 I rented a
beginner's vehicle for you!
COOP72092	AAAAAA==	It's this tractor!
COOP72093	AAAAAA==	It's huge.|Is this really for beginners?
COOP72094	AAAAAA==	It sure is! As they say	 the bigger	 the
better!
COOP72095	AAAAAA==	I went to the rental shop and asked for the
biggest one they had!
COOP72096	AAAAAA==	Since it's a land vehicle	 it's perfect for
beginners!
COOP72097	AAAAAA==	That means there's no risk of it crashing
like with a plane or a helicopter.
COOP72098	AAAAAA==	And you don't have to worry about getting
bucked off like with a moody horse either!
COOP72099	AAAAAA==	All right. Practice makes perfect! Go ahead
and give it a spin!
COOP72100	AAAAAA==	I'll teach you the basics of how to work it!
COOP72101	AAAAAA==	Don't worry. This place is nice and open.
There's absolutely nothing out here!
COOP72102	AAAAAA==	You've got no risk of crashing into anything!
COOP72103	AAAAAA==	That's it	 you're getting the hang of it!
COOP72104	AAAAAA==	Hey!
COOP72105	AAAAAA==	You're turning the wheel too much! No	 not
this way! Watch out!
COOP72106	AAAAAA==	Are you ready	 Russet? I'll make a tractor
master outta you!
COOP72107	AAAAAA==	Yui taught me how to drive a
tractor. She praised me for
getting better.
COOP72108	AAAAAA==	Yui taught me how to drive a
tractor. I'm starting to get
the hang of it.
COOP72109	AAAAAA==	Yui taught me how to drive a
tractor. I managed to steer
my way to a neighboring area.
COOP72110	AAAAAA==	Yui taught me how to drive a
tractor. We chatted while she
sat in the passenger's seat.
COOP72111	AAAAAA==	Yui taught me how to drive a
tractor. We got a second one
and drove together.
COOP72120	AAAAAA==	This farm is owned by the admin who manages
this world.
COOP72121	AAAAAA==	They've been recruiting volunteers to help
harvest their crops	 actually.
COOP72122	AAAAAA==	Since we're running a farm of our own	 this
is a great place to gain experience!
COOP72123	AAAAAA==	So	 what are we waiting for!? Let's get
farming!
COOP72124	AAAAAA==	Full steam ahead!|We're working for free?
COOP72125	AAAAAA==	I love seeing you so motivated! Our farm sure
has a bright future ahead of it!
COOP72126	AAAAAA==	I'll be doing my best to keep up with you!
Hehehe!
COOP72127	AAAAAA==	About that	 they'll share some of the crops
with us!
COOP72128	AAAAAA==	Let's take a bunch of them back!
COOP72129	AAAAAA==	By the way	 I heard that the crops we'll be
harvesting are cyber radishes.
COOP72130	AAAAAA==	We should compete to see who can
harvest the most!
COOP72131	AAAAAA==	Watch me! I'm not going to lose!
COOP72132	AAAAAA==	I want you to start from this end of the row!
COOP72133	AAAAAA==	Oh! And no flying allowed!
COOP72134	AAAAAA==	Ready... Set... Go!
COOP72135	AAAAAA==	Our strength is needed! Russet	 let's give
volunteering our all.
COOP72136	AAAAAA==	Yui and I volunteered at the
admin's farm. We harvested
cyber carrots together.
COOP72137	AAAAAA==	Yui and I volunteered at the
admin's farm. We harvested
cyber pumpkins together.
COOP72138	AAAAAA==	Yui and I volunteered at the
admin's farm. We hosed down
the crops together.
COOP72139	AAAAAA==	Yui and I volunteered at the
admin's farm. We fertilized
the field together.
COOP72140	AAAAAA==	Yui and I volunteered at the
admin's farm. We finished
early and went for a stroll.
COOP73000	AAAAAA==	I promised to invite Yui to
my virtual room...
COOP73002	AAAAAA==	Huh...
COOP73003	AAAAAA==	It's completely	 totally empty!
COOP73004	AAAAAA==	Do you know how to place objects in your
room? Why haven't you put anything here?
COOP73005	AAAAAA==	Too busy with farming...|There's some decorative plants...
COOP73006	AAAAAA==	That's true	 you and I have been hard at work
cultivating our fields	 haven't we	 Russet?
COOP73007	AAAAAA==	But your room is just so gloomy with nothing
inside!
COOP73008	AAAAAA==	Although it's not exactly correct to say
there's "nothing" here. I understand that.
COOP73009	AAAAAA==	Over here	 you have that first-time login
bonus given to every new player!
COOP73010	AAAAAA==	Ah	 nothing else we can do! In that case...
COOP73011	AAAAAA==	I shall be your personal interior decorator	
Russet!
COOP73012	AAAAAA==	Now that that's been decided...
COOP73013	AAAAAA==	We'll put a dining table right there	 along
with two chairs.
COOP73014	AAAAAA==	And over here we can put some shelves with
plants. I'll help you care for them	 too!
COOP73015	AAAAAA==	Are you going to live here?|Do I get a say in this?
COOP73016	AAAAAA==	Huh!? Wh-What are you saying?
COOP73017	AAAAAA==	I... I see your point. This sort of
conversation does make us sound like a
couple of newlyweds...
COOP73018	AAAAAA==	Oh	 Russet	 you're such a kidder!
COOP73019	AAAAAA==	Apologies. I suppose I was pushing all of my
own preferences onto you.
COOP73020	AAAAAA==	Just like with our farm	 we should take both
of our opinions into consideration.
COOP73021	AAAAAA==	This is going to be a fabulous room. I can't
wait!
COOP73022	AAAAAA==	Just one more thing I have to look
forward to!
COOP73023	AAAAAA==	I hope you'll invite me again soon!
COOP73024	AAAAAA==	I spent some time alone with
Yui in my virtual room... She
seemed to be having fun.
COOP73025	AAAAAA==	This is exciting! I have so many ideas about
what Russet and I can do with this room!
COOP73026	AAAAAA==	I spent some time with Yui in
my virtual room. We discussed
our living preferences.
COOP77000	AAAAAA==	I started up the game console
in my room...
COOP77001	AAAAAA==	I logged on to Virtual Produce Paradise.
COOP78100	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP78101	AAAAAA==	Yui wasn't online
after all...
COOP78102	AAAAAA==	I fended off every last
potato mole alone like
a true badass.
COOP78103	AAAAAA==	I dealt with the potato moles
swiftly by myself. Looks like
the damage wasn't too bad.
COOP78105	AAAAAA==	I managed to keep the potato
moles at bay alone. Even had
time to fertilize the soil.
COOP78104	AAAAAA==	I'll have to defend our
fields like this until Yui
comes back...
COOP78106	AAAAAA==	Looks like there's a pest
problem on the farmland...
COOP78107	AAAAAA==	If I log on now	 Yui probably
won't be there	 though...
COOP78108	AAAAAA==	That said	 saving our plot
from pests would surely
strengthen my bond with Yui...
COOP78109	AAAAAA==	I invited Yui to my
virtual room... Better sign in
and get things ready.
COOP79974	AAAAAA==	I decided to log on and
check on our land.
COOP79975	AAAAAA==	Yui seemed eager to show me
around Harvest World Online...
COOP79977	AAAAAA==	Sign in|Leave
COOP79978	AAAAAA==	Now	 where should we
hang out...
COOP79979	AAAAAA==	Maybe next time.
COOP79980	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that's right	 I have
something Yui might like...
COOP79981	AAAAAA==	Should I give this to Yui?
COOP79982	AAAAAA==	Wow... You'd really let me have such a
wonderful gift?
COOP79983	AAAAAA==	This makes me so	 so happy!
COOP79984	AAAAAA==	You've really got a great sense for
gift-giving	 don't you	 Russet?
COOP79985	AAAAAA==	Oh	 wow	 a gift?
COOP79986	AAAAAA==	This is incredible! Now I have to think of
what to get you in return!
COOP79987	AAAAAA==	Maybe another time.
COOP79998	AAAAAA==	AAAAAA==
COOP80802	AAAAAA==	Sure	 I'll go with you.|Sorry	 I've got plans...
COOP80808	AAAAAA==	Tomoko looks a little nervous.
COOP80817	AAAAAA==	Oh yeah	 totally.|Maybe something more subdued?|Why not pair it with this?
COOP80837	AAAAAA==	Glad I could help.|I haven't done anything.|I know you'll find your confidence.
COOP80850	AAAAAA==	Wish we could help.|Is there anything we can do?|Let's go help her!
COOP80858	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Tomoko

candy craft screamed Edo...
COOP98002	AAAAAA==	No problem.|Now's not a great time...
COOP98004	AAAAAA==	Yaoling and I went back to
my place.
COOP98013	AAAAAA==	It's beautiful...|It's fascinating...
COOP98020	AAAAAA==	The exquisite presentation
made the tea and sweets
all the more satisfying...
COOP98022	AAAAAA==	Yaoling and I enjoyed the tea

COOP98023	AAAAAA==	Looks like Yaoling wants
to talk about something...
I should go and see her.
COOP98024	AAAAAA==	Looks like Yaoling wants
to talk about something...
I should head to her place.
COOP100004	AAAAAA==	You bet.|Not really.

COOP100017	AAAAAA==	Where did that come from?|So	 what did you wanna talk about?
COOP100028	AAAAAA==	Why me?|Why not someone else?|I dunno...
COOP100038	AAAAAA==	Okay then.|I'll get supersized everything.|I guess if you're paying...
COOP100043	AAAAAA==	Spending time with Shun	
I feel hope rising

COOP100252	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shun
growing deeper...
COOP100254	AAAAAA==	After eating	 I got a recipe
and parted ways with Shun...
COOP100302	AAAAAA==	I could eat.|I can't make it today.
COOP100309	AAAAAA==	I mean	 if it tastes good...|Better than waiting in line.
COOP100321	AAAAAA==	Ashamed?|What happened?|Was it the chili paste?
COOP100344	AAAAAA==	This is only the beginning.|You've grown so much.|Is that a bad thing?
COOP100352	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shun
growing deeper...
COOP100355	AAAAAA==	Despite his difficulty
speaking	 Shun taught me
a recipe.
COOP100356	AAAAAA==	I parted ways with Shun
so he could go buy himself
some green tea.
COOP100402	AAAAAA==	I am pretty hungry .|I've got plans today.

COOP100459	AAAAAA==	As Shun frantically searched
for napkins	 he taught me
a recipe.
COOP100502	AAAAAA==	I guess I am hungry.|I'm busy right now.
COOP100513	AAAAAA==	What did you learn?|Quit being cryptic...|That was delicious.
COOP100531	AAAAAA==	Is this a big deal?|Is she someone important?
COOP100549	AAAAAA==	What do YOU want to do?|Don't ask me...|That reward might be nice.
COOP100563	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shun
growing deeper...
COOP100567	AAAAAA==	After Shun shared a recipe
with me	 we left the diner and
parted ways.
COOP100602	AAAAAA==	I guess I am hungry.|I'm busy right now.
COOP100644	AAAAAA==	Depends on how it tastes.|Going for the weirdest entry?
COOP100621	AAAAAA==	It's delicious	 but...|Nice eat-and-walk-ability	 but...
COOP100628	AAAAAA==	The appearance.|Your target customers.|Is it on-theme?
COOP100638	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shun

COOP100768	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shun
growing deeper...
COOP100770	AAAAAA==	After getting a recipe	
I parted ways with a visibly
more motivated Shun...
COOP100803	AAAAAA==	Then let's take a break.|Now's not a great time...
COOP100806	AAAAAA==	Heritage Kitchen?|Heritage Kitchen	 duh.
COOP100813	AAAAAA==	Fried rice sounds good.|I guess I'll have the same.|Really? Not ramen this time?
COOP100820	AAAAAA==	Yamagoshi continues cooking	
and a regular named Shige-san
comes in...
COOP100836	AAAAAA==	What's the deal?|Is it some kind of mistake?|Is it a new menu item?
COOP100855	AAAAAA==	Good to hear.|Get what?
COOP100869	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Shun
growing deeper...
COOP100871	AAAAAA==	After getting a recipe	
I parted ways with Shun	
excited for his next creation.
COOP100904	AAAAAA==	Of course I do.|I have plans today...

parted ways with Shun.
COOP101003	AAAAAA==	I could do with a bite to eat.|Sorry	 got places to be.
COOP101018	AAAAAA==	This should be good then.|"My preferences" meaning...?|So that was your plan.
COOP101024	AAAAAA==	Simple but I still want more.|Like high potential in a bowl.|The ramen... disappeared?
COOP101032	AAAAAA==	Anytime.|Let's try something besides ramen.|So long as you're paying.
COOP101038	AAAAAA==	I feel a strong bond between
me and Shun...
COOP101040	AAAAAA==	Shun gave me a recipe	
and we discussed what our next
culinary experience will be...
COOP109000	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that's right	 I have
something Shun might like...
COOP109001	AAAAAA==	Should I give this to Yaoling?
COOP109007	AAAAAA==	Maybe another time.
COOP108902	AAAAAA==	I'm in.|Not today...
COOP108904	AAAAAA==	I agreed to hang out
with Shun...
COOP108906	AAAAAA==	Shun wants to try a new dish
with me. I should go find him.
COOP108907	AAAAAA==	Shun wants to borrow my

something Shun might like...
COOP109011	AAAAAA==	Should I give this to Shun?
COOP109017	AAAAAA==	Maybe another time.
COOP109695	AAAAAA==	Shun and I visited a museum in
Ueno. Luckily	 students get in
for free today.

Ueno. We read the pamphlet as

COOP109697	AAAAAA==	Shun and I visited a museum in
Ueno. We got excited over a
ramen sculpture.
COOP109698	AAAAAA==	Shun and I visited a museum in
Ueno. Even I could recognize
some of the works on display!
COOP109699	AAAAAA==	Shun and I visited a museum in
Ueno. The artists' passion
radiated from their works.
COOP109703	AAAAAA==	No problem.|You mean	 like	 right now...?
COOP109706	AAAAAA==	Shun and I went back
to my place.
COOP109713	AAAAAA==	I can't wait to taste-test.|Why the sudden sweet tooth?
COOP109724	AAAAAA==	Shun came over to make some dessert. There's
more to making sweets than I thought.
COOP109725	AAAAAA==	Seems like Shun has
something to talk about.
I should go see him.
COOP109726	AAAAAA==	Seems like Shun wants to use
my kitchen for something.
I should head over now.
COOP110002	AAAAAA==	Sounds like something might be
weighing on Tomiyama's mind...
COOP110003	AAAAAA==	Maybe I ought to hear her out?
COOP110005	AAAAAA==	What's the matter?|Welp	 see ya later.
COOP110016	AAAAAA==	That's great.|Sounds tough.
COOP110022	AAAAAA==	You seem mature and reliable.|You might be a bit much for some.|What's a space cadet?
COOP110039	AAAAAA==	What is it?|Is it food?
COOP110045	AAAAAA==	Right now?|Right here?
COOP110049	AAAAAA==	Guess I have to get changed...
COOP110052	AAAAAA==	Guess I have to spin around...
COOP110056	AAAAAA==	Spending time with Tomiyama	
I feel hope rising
within me...
COOP110060	AAAAAA==	Seems like her appearance when
she was young is important to
Tomiyama's identity.
COOP110062	AAAAAA==	I feel my bond with Tomiyama
growing deeper...
COOP110065	AAAAAA==	I should go back home

COOP111057	AAAAAA==	The role asked of you?|Why do you act?
COOP111064	AAAAAA==	I didn't do anything special.|All I did was listen.

shop for some alcohol to kill these germs
off.
DS48002	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n Called Tanzou	Hahaha! A stiff drink can cure anythin'! But
you won't be able to taste the food with
a cold!
DS48003	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>namoto-kun	You're right about that. I'll come by when

DS48004	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n Called Tanzou	See you then! Now you take care of yourself	
you hear?

DS48008	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n Called Tanzou	Well hey there	 Yu-chan! How'd your boy's
big test go?

DS48014	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n Called Tanzou	You're so young! Cheer up a little!

So what's your name	 pal?
DS48016	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n Called Tanzou	{NAME2}? Now that's a good name! You should thank
your parents for that one.
DS48017	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n Called Tanzou	I'm Tanzou. Around here I'm known for runnin'
Yakitori Tanzou.
DS48018	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	You a yakitori fan	 {NAME2}?
DS48019	Choices	I am.|Not really...
DS48020	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Yeah	 ain't it the best? But y'know	 my
yakitori's extra special!
DS48021	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	That's just because you've never had real
yakitori before!
DS48022	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	And you're in luck	 because mine's the best
there is! One bite and you can tell
the difference!
DS48023	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It's so tasty you'll be clucking for more!
There's a sayin' about yakitori	 y'know...
DS48024	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It takes three years to master the skewer
and a lifetime to master the grill.
DS48025	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Our tare recipe's been adapted over
generations. And our salt skewers are just
as good!
DS48026	Inner Thoughts	Tanzou seems intensely
passionate about yakitori...
DS48027	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Oh	 look at me ramblin' on!
DS48028	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	In any case	 if you ever have a hankerin' for
yakitori	 come on by!
DS48029	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I'll serve you somethin' so good it'll knock
your socks off!
DS48030	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Hey! Mos-san! That broken bone heal up yet?
DS48031	Inner Thoughts	Tanzou continues calling out
to passersby...
DS48032	Inner Thoughts	He seems like a good-natured
busybody. I should talk to him
again some time.
DS49000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The smell of grilled meat arouses desire.
Shall we find out where it's coming from?
DS49001	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	One order of negima! Thanks for waiting!
DS49002	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	It looks heavenly! Time to dig in.
DS49003	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	Aaah... Nothing can beat eating yakitori
after school!
DS49004	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	No contest! Plus	 we've got the real
yakitori here.
DS49005	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It takes three years to master the skewer
and a lifetime to master the grill.
DS49006	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	Oh	 Tanzo's usual routine has begun! It must
be hard to become a first-class artisan
like him.
DS49007	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	It's not just about the technique	 though.
Aren't the ingredients just as important?
DS49008	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Of course!
DS49009	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Fresh chickens and hand-picked green onions.
And a secret sauce passed down
for generations!
DS49010	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	We slowly and carefully grill it
over charcoal...
DS49011	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It's a simple job	 but the finished product
is entirely dependent on the skill
of the chef.
DS49012	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	I see. So all that attention to detail
is why Tanzo-san's yakitori is so delicious!
DS49013	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	But	 it's a bit of a detour going from my place
 to Zoshigaya.
DS49014	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	Tanzo-san	 do you do offer yakitori delivery
by chance?
DS49015	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	If there was delivery	 I'd go broke in
a week! I'd recommend it to my family	 too!
DS49016	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I don't know... The setup seems like a
bother... Plus	 I'd have to hire a part-timer
for delivery.
DS49017	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I'll give it a little more thought	
then. Thanks!
DS49018	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	Please do! If it actually works out	 I'd be
so happy!
DS49019	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Well then	 how about one more? It's on
the house.
DS49020	S<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tisfied Customer	It's tempting	 but I have dinner waiting at
home. I'll drop by again soon!
DS49025	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	You'd think so	 but...
DS49026	Choices	Something wrong?|Sorry	 gotta dash.
DS49027	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I've been thinking...
DS49028	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	...Welcome.
DS49030	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Oh	 it's you.
DS49031	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Hey	 do you know anything about online
delivery? Like making a food order from
your cell phone?
DS49032	Choices	I make orders all the time.|I don't use it very often.
DS49033	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I see... It really is that popular...
DS49034	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It seemed like a hassle	 so I've never done
it. Been on my mind for a while	 though...
DS49035	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	For people for want yakitori but are too far
away	 we could deliver them real yakitori...
DS49036	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	If we can pull this off	 just imagine...
Yakitori delivery!
DS49037	Choices	That's a great idea.|It's perfect!
DS49038	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It's reassuring hearing it from you	 too.
Well then	 I'm gonna get this started
right away.
DS49039	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	... What should I do first?
DS49040	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Truth is	 I do have a smartphone	 but I've
never even ordered delivery before.
DS49041	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	You know anything about this type of thing?
Maybe you could give it a look...
DS49042	Choices	Let's check it out together.|Leave it to me.
DS49043	Protagonist	While looking at the delivery service's
website	 I managed to get the basic
settings configured...
DS49044	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Ooh	 you're already done? As reliable
as always!
DS49045	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Hm? Not only do they want photos of the food	
but of the stand	 too?
DS49046	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Oh man... Whenever someone asks me to
take pictures	 they always come out blurry
and awkward-looking.
DS49047	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Please! Could I ask you to take some for me?
DS49050	Protagonist	I finished taking photos of
the stand. I should go 
tell Tanzo...
DS49051	Choices	How do these look?|I got some good ones.
DS49052	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Thank you so much! I'll get these photos you
took keyed in	 and...
DS49053	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	There	 now we just need to wait for orders!
DS49054	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Ooh	 we got one in already!
DS49055	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It's for... a Yakitori Seven Set.
DS49056	Choices	It's your first order.|Your very first customer.
DS49057	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Yeah. I'm very grateful...
DS49058	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Still	 ordering this quickly after we just
got set up? Maybe they're a regular. Or a
huge yakitori lover.
DS49059	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	In any event	 their desire for delicious
yakitori is the same as it is here.
DS49060	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Let's get out there and deliver some
real yakitori.
DS49061	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	The address is... An aparment in Yongen-Jaya.
DS49062	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Alright	 I'll get it ready	 and...
DS49063	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	N-no! I forgot that I don't even have a
delivery person!
DS49064	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	... Hey	 kid. You free after this?
DS49065	Choices	I'm free.|I was going to take a nap...
DS49066	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Okay... So you have plenty of time on your
hands	 huh?
DS49067	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Please	 please help me with deliveries! I'll
pay you really well!
DS49068	Choices	Okay.|Looking forward to the pay.
DS49069	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Then it's settled! From this day onward	 your
our delivery person!
DS49070	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Here's my phone number. If anything happens	
call me.
DS49071	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I'll get it ready now. Hold on just one sec.
DS49072	Protagonist	Tanzo prepared the yakitori
with an effortless dexterity...
DS49073	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It's ready! Our very first delivery.
DS49074	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I'm counting on your delivery. The customer's
a waiting!
DS49075	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	The address is an aparment in Yongen-Jaya.
Watch out for cars!
DS49080	Protagonist	This seems to be the
right address...
DS49081	Protagonist	Apartment 201... Looks like
the right place.
DS49082	Choices	Food delivery.|Your yakitori has arrived.
DS49083	Protagonist	There's no response...
DS49084	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>familiar Woman	Do you need something from 201?
DS49085	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>familiar Woman	I think they're out at the moment.
DS49086	Choices	But they ordered food...|I'm sure this is the right place.
DS49087	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>familiar Woman	We passed each other on the sidewalk just
a moment ago.
DS49088	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>familiar Woman	Around this time	 the person who lives there
usually goes for a walk around the neighborhood.
DS49089	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>familiar Woman	Maybe they forgot about their delivery and
left anyways? Maybe you can try calling them?
DS49090	Protagonist	I dont have the customer's
phone number...
DS49091	Protagonist	I should check with Tanzo.
DS49100	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Hello? Everything all right? Did
something happen?
DS49101	Choices	The customer's out...|I'd like the customer's number.
DS49102	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I see! Let me see here... One second...
DS49103	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Sorry	 I should be the one calling them	
but... The shop's way too busy. I'm counting
on you.
DS49104	Choices	No problem.|I'll take care of it.
DS49105	Protagonist	It sounds like Tanzo's busy
with the shop... I should call
the customer myself.
DS49106	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	Yes	 hello?
DS49107	Choices	Food delivery.|I came to deliver your yakitori...
DS49108	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	Ah! You've arrived already? That was quicker
than I thought...
DS49109	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	I'm actually out on a walk right now.
DS49110	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	I found some delicious yakitori online	 so I
ordered it without even thinking.
DS49111	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	Well	 I ordered in advance because I thought
it'd arrive just in time for me to get back.
DS49112	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	Ah	 but... It's also nice to eat yakitori
while having a drink in the park...
DS49113	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	Um... I'm really sorry about this	 but could
you come meet me here?
DS49114	Choices	Can do.|This is a special	 one-time service.
DS49115	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	I'm currently near the movie theater in
Yongen-Jaya.
DS49116	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>stomer on the Phone	Sorry for the extra work! I'll wait for
you here.
DS49120	E<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>derly Person on a Walk	Something I can help... Oh? That package...
Are you the delivery person?
DS49121	Protagonist	Could this be the person who
ordered yakitori delivery?
DS49122	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Oh	 I'm really sorry! It just slipped my mind
while I was out...
DS49123	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	That smells really good. I'm pretty peckish
right now	 too.
DS49124	Choices	Thank you for waiting.|We do offer free delivery.
DS49125	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Sorry for making you come all the way here.
You really saved the day!
DS49126	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Haha	 I feel so bad making you come here.
Sending you on a scavenger hunt to find me...
DS49127	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	As expected	 there are seven kinds of skewers
 packed in here.
DS49128	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Can I really eat this much in one sitting?
DS49129	Choices	It's delicious	 so it's fine.|You'll eat it like candy.
DS49130	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Hahaha	 you're that confident	 huh? I'm
looking forward to it even more now.
DS49131	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	I've always had a soft spot for yakitori...
DS49132	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Unfortunately	 I haven't found a go-to place
around here yet.
DS49133	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Since there aren't any good ones around	
I tried to look for delivery...
DS49134	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	When I saw a new yakitori place delivering	
I ordered right away.
DS49135	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	Ah	 sorry for taking up so much of your time.
DS49136	J<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ro Nakano	I think I'll bring this to the park and enjoy
a nice drink with my skewers.
DS49140	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Welcome back! So	 how did it go?
DS49141	Choices	Somehow	 it worked out...|Piece of cake.
DS49142	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Alright! First order completed with no
issues! Excellent work!
DS49143	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	The customer left positive feedback	 too.
I was moved by your thoughtful delivery.
What a glowing review!
DS49144	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	It feels pretty nice to receive a written
message like this.
DS49145	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Until now	 I thought that I shouldn't look
at the faces of my customers	 but...
DS49146	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	With delivery	 we can make even more
customers happy!
DS49147	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Whether it's the stand or delivery	 I'm
gonna give it my all!
DS49148	Choices	I'll support you.|Let's both give it our best.
DS49149	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I'll be needing lots of your support here
on out. I'm counting on you!
DS49150	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Ah	 and here's your pay. You're a lifesaver!

DS50000	Inner Thoughts	A woman in a sweatshirt is
looking back and forth between
the street and her phone...
DS50001	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Um	 hey! You over there!
DS50002	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Can you tell me how to get to the station?
DS50003	Choices	Which station?|Might be better to look it up.
DS50004	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	I'm terrible with directions. Even if I use
my phone	 I never end up where I need to be.
DS50005	Inner Thoughts	According to my phone's map	
she's going the opposite
direction of the station...
DS50006	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	The complete opposite? You're kidding. How'd
I get that turned around?
DS50007	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Anyway	 thanks! You really helped me out.
See ya!
DS50008	Inner Thoughts	Looks like she's still not
going the right way...
DS50009	Choices	That's the wrong way.|You really are bad with directions.
DS50010	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Huh? Ahaha... Oops.
DS50011	Inner Thoughts	If I let her go on her own	
I don't think she'll ever find
her way...
DS50012	Choices	I can show you to the station.|Follow me.
DS50013	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Oh	 really? That'd be great. Thanks!
DS50014	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Wait... You mean you'll take me to the
station? Wow	 that's so nice of you!
DS50015	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Sorry to be a pain. Please	 lead the way!
DS50016	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	Oh	 I forgot to introduce myself.
DS50017	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>n-Tanned Woman	I'm <color=#FF423F>Namie Komatsu</color>. You?
DS50018	Choices	I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|You don't need to know.
DS50019	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	{NAME2}-kun? All right	 I'll remember that!
DS50020	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Haha	 the heck does that mean? Just tell me!
DS50021	Inner Thoughts	I eventually introduced
myself.
DS50022	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	So I'm super into running	 right? It's a
hobby that takes me to different places all
over the city.
DS50023	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Everyone else these days uses treadmills at
the gym	 but I'm more of an outdoorsy type.
DS50024	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Going for a run under the sun just feels
better	 you know?
DS50025	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	So which side are you on?
DS50026	Choices	Team treadmill.|I need fresh air on my face.
DS50027	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I see. Well at least you don't have to worry
about getting lost at the gym	 right?
DS50028	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Considering how I am with directions	
that's a plus!
DS50029	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Ah	 you get it! It's so much nicer	
isn't it?
DS50030	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	But you've seen how I am with directions.
DS50031	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I try to make sure to run around parks and
stuff so I won't get lost.
DS50032	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	But the same old scenery gets boring.
Sometimes I'll try a new location	 and then
of course...
DS50033	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I get lost! Just like I did today. Ahahaha!
DS50034	Inner Thoughts	Komatsu seems pretty
laid-back...
DS50035	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	We made it!
DS50036	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Thanks a ton! Who knows how long I'd have
been wandering around if it weren't for you?
DS50037	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I like running. Wandering aimlessly? Not so
much! Ahaha!
DS50038	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Like I said before	 I go running all over
the city.
DS50039	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	If you ever see me around	 don't hesitate
to say hey!
DS50040	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I'm sure I'll probably get lost again like
I did today...
DS50041	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	In which case it'd be great if you could
show me the way. Anyway	 later!
DS50042	Inner Thoughts	I became acquaintances with
<color=#FF423F>Namie Komatsu</color>...
DS51000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I had disregarded Inokashira Park as just
another mere strip of urban greenery	 but it
seems to be highly rated by the public.
DS51001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's also an aquarium	 botanical garden	
and a zoo	 so people of any persuasion can
enjoy themselves there.
DS51002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you have some time	 why not see
for yourself?
DS51005	Protagonist	I should try going to
Inokashira Park...

DS51021	Choices	Just out for a walk.|Enjoying the fresh air.
DS51022	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Yeah	 it's great here! It's one of my
favorite running spots too.
DS51023	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	As long as I just circle the lake	 I don't
have to worry about getting lost!
DS51024	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	*grrrr...*
DS51025	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Urgh	 all this running made me hungry...
DS51026	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Hey	 want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?
It'll be my treat!
DS51027	Choices	Sounds great!|I'm not too hungry...
DS51028	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Okay	 then let's go to <color=#FF423F>Boom Bang Burger
in Shibuya</color>! There's a limited-time menu I've
been dying to try.
DS51040	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Come to think of it	 the first time we ran
into each other was in Shimo-Kitazawa	
wasn't it?
DS51041	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	You're a high schooler	 right? Is that where
your school is?
DS51042	Choices	I go to Kokatsu.|Do you know Kokatsu Academy?
DS51043	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Right	 that's the one! I've heard it's a
good school.
DS51044	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	That area doesn't have too many cars	 so
it's a nice place to go running...
DS51045	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Ahaha! Sorry	 I guess I'm always thinking
about running.
DS51046	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I've been training quite a while now	 but
of course I'm still nowhere near pro level.
DS51047	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Whenever I see a marathon runner	 I can't
help but think how cool they look.
DS51048	Choices	Why not enter one?|I see them on TV sometimes.
DS51049	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Hmm... Well	 there are plenty of marathon
events open to the general public.
DS51050	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	But to me	 it's not really about the
competition aspect...
DS51051	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I guess I just want someone who will run
with me.
DS51052	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Yeah	 same here! Whenever they have one
on TV	 I never miss it.
DS51053	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	But when I watch it	 I guess I'm not
thinking about wanting to be up there myself.
DS51054	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	If anything	 I just wish I had someone
to run with.

DS51060	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Great! Actually	 talking to you made me want
to try running in Shimo-Kitazawa again.
DS51061	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	If you're with me	 I don't think I'll have
to worry about getting lost...
DS51062	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	How's that sound? After we eat	 want to go
out for a run together?

DS51095	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	And finish it up with some leg lifts! How's
that? Feeling warmed up yet?
DS51096	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	I'll be our rabbit for today. All you have
to do is follow me.
DS51097	Choices	Rabbit?|I think I've heard of that...
DS51098	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Rabbit is something they say in
long-distance races. It's also called
a "pacemaker".
DS51099	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	They're usually a more experienced athlete
who can set the pace for the rest of
the runners.
DS51100	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	So as long as you've got a pacemaker	
everyone can run with no worries.

cool down.
DS51152	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	It's important to prevent lactic acid from

causing soreness.
DS51153	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	Phew	 that feels great! My whole body's
relaxed now.
DS51154	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu	So	 how's it feel to have run 15 kilos?

DS51155	Choices	For sure.|I saw a light...

DS54000	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Ooh	 ooh	 did you hear!? Someone from the
next classroom over told me about this.
DS54001	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	It's a puzzle challenge that's supposed to
be suuuper hard!
DS54002	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>eepy Girl	What's so hard about it?
DS54003	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	They didn't know either! I wonder!
DS54004	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	You get a stamp for each question you get
right! And there's a prize for getting
them all!
DS54005	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Maybe the questions are really difficult?
Or it's hard for some other reason...
DS54006	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Hey	 Kyo-kun	 Yuna-chan	 doesn't it sound
cool to you too!?
DS54007	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Hm... I guess it sounds kind of interesting?
DS54008	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	With Nishimori here	 the puzzles will be
easy-peasy. What do we get if we win?
DS54009	Inner Thoughts	There's some kind of puzzle
challenge event happening
on Central Street...
DS54010	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>motivated Staff	Oh	 would you like to try?
DS54011	Choices	Join in|Not right now
DS54012	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>motivated Staff	You can get a stamp sheet from the guy
sitting over there.
DS54013	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>motivated Staff	All the rules are on the sheet	 so be sure to
read it	 okay?
DS54014	Inner Thoughts	I decided to take
the challenge.
DS54015	Inner Thoughts	I decided to pass.
DS54580	Inner Thoughts	There's some kind of puzzle
challenge event happening
on Central Street.
DS54581	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>motivated Staff	Oh	 would you like to try?
DS54582	Choices	Join in|Not right now
DS54583	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>motivated Staff	Pick up your stamp cards over there.
DS54584	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>motivated Staff	The event rules are written on the cards	
so check there before you ask me	
thank you...
DS54585	Inner Thoughts	I decided to take
the challenge.
DS54586	Inner Thoughts	I decided to pass.
DS54587	Inner Thoughts	AAAAAA==
DS54020	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Customer	Huh? These questions are ridiculous.
What's up with this?
DS54021	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Customer	Maybe answer randomly? You might still
get a stamp.
DS54022	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>le Customer	Nah	 I'm out. I'm sure the prize is nothing
exciting anyway. Let's go.
DS54023	Inner Thoughts	There's a challenge question
here. It looks like a standard
logic puzzle.
DS54024	Inner Thoughts	You have to figure out which
two out of seven suspects
are lying.
DS54025	Inner Thoughts	No matter how many times
I read it over	 it doesn't
add up...
DS54026	Inner Thoughts	Is there even a right answer?
DS54027	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Haruna-chan	 the next question's over here!
DS54028	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Whoa	 I don't get this one at all!
You solve it	 Nishimori!
DS54029	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Hmmm?
DS54030	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	This puzzle's wrong!
DS54031	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	It says there are two liars	 but if that's
true	 then all their stories are
contradictory!
DS54032	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Contra...dictory?
DS54033	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	We learned it at cram school	 remember?
It means when things don't match up.
DS54034	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Huh? So there's no way to answer this one?
DS54035	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Let's go tell the staff! We've gotta let them
know their puzzle doesn't have an answer!
DS54036	Inner Thoughts	That girl's right. This puzzle
isn't written correctly...
DS54037	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	Oh	 are you participating in the
puzzle challenge?
DS54038	Inner Thoughts	I explained there was
a problem with the puzzle.
DS54039	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	Oh	 so that's what was up?
DS54040	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	There were so many people who couldn't
answer it	 I've just been giving them
stamps anyway.
DS54041	Inner Thoughts	I decided to take the stamp
and keep going.
DS54050	Li<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>ely Girl	That's not it!
DS54051	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	We don't have the stamp from the diner	
but not because the puzzle was too hard!
DS54052	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Look	 kid. If you don't have all the stamps	
I can't give you the prize. Sorry.
DS54053	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	But the question was written wrong!
It's unsolvable! That's why we don't have
the stamp!
DS54054	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	I don't think so. These questions were
written by adults	 okay? And plenty of other
people got that stamp.
DS54055	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	So no skipping. Just go back and try that
one again. Then you can get your prize.
DS54056	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	But Haruna-chan's smarter than any grown-up.
DS54057	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Forget it. They're never gonna listen to us.
Let's just go home.
DS54058	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	But...
DS54059	Inner Thoughts	Looks like those kids from
earlier are having trouble
with the event staff...
DS54060	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Oh	 did you finish the puzzle challenge?
You can pick up your prize here!
DS54061	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	See here	 kids? This guy was able to get
the stamp.
DS54062	Choices	About that puzzle...|They just gave me the stamp.
DS54063	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Right!? You saw it was unsolvable too!
DS54064	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Wait	 huh? How did you get the stamp then?
DS54065	Inner Thoughts	I explained that the diner was
giving away stamps even if you
couldn't solve the puzzle.
DS54066	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	What!? Seriously!?
DS54067	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Then there really is a problem with the puzzle?
DS54068	Inner Thoughts	I explained the problem with
how the puzzle was written.
DS54069	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Ahhh. So that's why so few people have
finished. Who wrote these questions anyway?
DS54070	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	I'm sorry for not listening to you kids.
DS54071	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	That's okay! I'm glad you get it now.
DS54072	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Can we still not get the prize? Do we need
to go get the stamp?
DS54073	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	No	 no	 you can have it! You have all the
stamps except the diner after all.
DS54074	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	We have plenty left anyway. You can have
one each.
DS54075	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>vely Girl	Really!? Yay!
DS54076	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Isn't this great	 Haruna-chan!?
DS54077	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	And one for you too. It's a souvenir
keychain!
DS54078	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Oh right. Could I get your names? I'm
supposed to keep track of the winners.
DS54079	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	I don't need your address or phone number
or anything! Just your name.
DS54080	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It's <color=#FF423F>Haruna Nishimori</color>! You write "Haruna"
with the characters for sun and flower!
DS54081	Inner Thoughts	I gave the staff my name.
DS54082	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Haruna Nishimori-san	 and
{PLAYER_NAME}-san. All right	 got it.
DS54083	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Employee	Thanks for letting us know about the mistake
with that puzzle.
DS54084	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You're welcome!
DS54085	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	I kind of thought the keychains would be
bigger.
DS54086	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Come on	 we're some of the only ones who
got them! These are super ultra rare!
DS54087	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Thanks!
DS54088	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	And we got to find out why everyone thought
the puzzle challenge was so hard!
DS54089	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	It's a good thing you were here.
DS54090	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	I don't think they'd have ever listened to
just us.
DS54091	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Thanks for your help!
DS54092	Choices	You're welcome.|Nah	 it was all you.
DS54093	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Teeheehee!
DS54094	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Uh oh! I've gotta be home soon.
DS54095	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Ah	 you're right! Me too!
DS54096	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 I didn't realize it was so late already!
DS54097	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	We'd better go then!
DS54098	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Bye bye!
DS54099	Inner Thoughts	Haruna and her friends left...
DS54110	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	There's some time left before your classes
start. Why don't we wait in the diner?
DS54111	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Aww	 I don't wanna go to cram school...
DS54112	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	What're you gonna do while we're at
cram school	 Haruna-chan?
DS54113	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I have a session with a college professor!
We're gonna talk about category theory!
DS54114	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	So you're studying stuff we've never
heard of again. Is that actually useful
at all?
DS54115	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It might be! It's hard to say for sure
right now.
DS54116	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But it's fun! Like solving a puzzle!
The professor told me that's a good way
to think of it.
DS54117	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Remember that unsolvable puzzle from
the diner? It made me think of something...
DS54118	Inner Thoughts	It's the kids I met at the
puzzle challenge event...
DS54119	Choices	Say hello|Leave them alone
DS54120	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh!
DS54121	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Oh	 it's you.
DS54122	Inner Thoughts	I decided to leave the area.
DS54130	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Who's this? Someone you know?
DS54131	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Remember the question from the puzzle
challenge that was wrong?
DS54132	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	This is the person who helped us inform
the organizers!
DS54133	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	He and Haruna-chan were the only ones who
noticed the problem with the puzzle!
DS54134	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Oh	 I see. Are you a student?
DS54135	Inner Thoughts	I told her that I go to
Kokatsu Academy.
DS54136	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Oh	 the one in Shimokita? So you're a
high schooler.
DS54137	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	High school!?
DS54138	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	High school has classes like physics
and literature and world history	 right!?
DS54139	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	What're you studying now!? You've got to
tell me!
DS54140	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Don't you already study college stuff	
Nishimori?
DS54141	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Only math and English.
DS54142	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	I'm sorry	 she always gets like this when
something piques her interest.
DS54143	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Haruna	 let's head to the diner. Let's not
keep Yuna-chan and Kyo-kun waiting.
DS54144	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Whaaaaat!? But I wanna ask him about
high school!
DS54145	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You'll tell me all about it	 right? Right?
Right!?
DS54146	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Pleeeaaase!
DS54147	Choices	Sure.|I guess I've got no choice.
DS54148	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yaaay!
DS54149	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Haruna... I'm really sorry about this.
DS54150	Inner Thoughts	I agreed to talk with Haruna.
DS54160	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh wow! I don't think I've ever seen a
high school language arts textbook before!
DS54161	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It even has classical texts! Hey	 can I look
at this one too?
DS54162	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Haruna	 don't make too much trouble for
him	 okay?
DS54163	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	I'm sorry. Tell me if she's becoming a
nuisance	 all right?
DS54164	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	She's been a little bundle of curiosity ever
since she was small.
DS54165	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>therly W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	Oh	 Kyo-kun	 Yuna-chan! What do you
wanna eat?
DS54166	Inner Thoughts	This must be Haruna's mother.
DS54167	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	These two are Haruna's friends from school.
Their mothers and I are "mom friends."
DS54168	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	We take turns watching the kids between
their regular school and cram school classes.
DS54169	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	We hang out outside of school too	 though.
Like the other day.
DS54170	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	We're an Exploration Team! We investigate
mysterious places around town and school!
DS54171	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	That's how we found out about that puzzle
challenge!
DS54172	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Just stay away from anywhere dangerous	
all right? I'm sure you all know that
already	 but...
DS54173	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Hey Nishimori	 can't we change our group
name to something less kiddie-sounding
already?
DS54174	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	No	 we can't! Shota-kun picked that name
for us!
DS54175	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	But Shota never plays with us anymore!
DS54176	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	That's true	 but...
DS54177	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	High school math is all weird symbols.
I can't tell what it's even supposed to mean.
DS54178	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Do you get this	 Nishimori? Who am I kidding	
this must be a piece of cake for you!
DS54179	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	If it's math	 then yeah! High school math is
so fun! It's just like solving a puzzle!
DS54180	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Then can you explain this?
DS54181	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Sure! You see	 this means...
DS54182	Inner Thoughts	She solved the whole problem
in her head...!
DS54183	Inner Thoughts	Haruna must be
incredibly smart...
DS54184	Yu<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	See? Haruna-chan's really good at math!
DS54185	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	She meets with a college math professor
every week. She even discovered a new
theorem!
DS54186	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	She's only in fourth grade	 but she's already
been accepted to a college in the US.
DS54187	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	She wants to wait until after elementary
school	 but they told us they'd welcome her
any time!
DS54188	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Ooh	 ooh! They told me their school is really
big! So big you can picnic in the yard!
DS54189	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Luckyyy. If I were as smart as that	
middle school entrance exams would be
nothin'.
DS54190	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	But she has to learn super formal English
so she can write essays and stuff.
It sounds tough.
DS54191	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It's not that bad! I have time to study while
you guys are at cram school anyway!
DS54192	Choices	That's amazing.|Good luck!
DS54193	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hehe	 thanks!
DS54194	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Thanks! I'll do my best!
DS54195	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 right! Mom	 do you have something to
write with?
DS54196	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	I do. What for? The usual?
DS54197	Inner Thoughts	Haruna started writing on
a large sheet of paper...
DS54198	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Done!
DS54199	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Here you go! It's a thank-you for helping us
with the puzzle challenge!
DS54200	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	She likes to make her own puzzles and
give them to people.
DS54201	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	She'd love for you to try it	 if you
don't mind.
DS54202	Inner Thoughts	Looks like a part crossword	
part matchstick puzzle...
DS54203	Inner Thoughts	It looks pretty difficult.
Solving this won't be
that simple...!
DS54204	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Ooh	 ooh	 ooh! Can I see it	 too!?
DS54205	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Ah	 me too! I wanna see too!
DS54206	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Okay! But if you guys figure it out	 you
can't tell him the answer	 all right?
DS54207	Inner Thoughts	With plenty of trial and
error	 the kids and I worked
through the puzzle.
DS54208	Inner Thoughts	I solved it...!
DS54209	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Wow! Amazing! That's right!
DS54210	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Awww	 I was about to get it too...
DS54211	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	No way! I wasn't even close!
DS54212	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	What'd you think?
DS54213	Inner Thoughts	I told Haruna I thought
the puzzle was hard	 but
very interesting.
DS54214	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Really!? Hehehe!
DS54215	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Seems like everyone had fun with it!
DS54216	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Thanks!
DS54217	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Kyo-kun	 Yuna-chan	 your class starts soon.
Should we get going?
DS54218	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	And you have your lesson too	 Haruna.
Be polite to the professor	 okay?
DS54219	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ildren	Coming!
DS54220	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Thank you for keeping us company. You really
kept them entertained!
DS54221	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Thanks for playing with me!
DS54222	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	If we ever meet again	 let's play some more!
DS54223	Choices	I look forward to it.|Promise?
DS54224	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yeah	 me too!
DS54225	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Promise!
DS54226	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Okay	 see you!
DS54227	Inner Thoughts	I said my goodbyes to Haruna
and the others and left
the diner.
DS54230	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	There aren't any tables for four open!
What do we do?
DS54231	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Go straight to cram school? They might
let us use the private study rooms.
DS54232	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Ugh	 I don't wanna go there...
DS54233	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Then should we go exploring? We won't go far.
DS54234	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	As long as it's not too crowded! I can't let
you kids get lost around here.
DS54235	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Okay! Where do we wanna go then?
DS54236	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Ooh!
DS54237	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	It's him!
DS54238	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Oh	 hello! It's nice to see you again.
DS54239	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hey	 are you doing anything right now?
DS54240	Choices	Not really...|I've got stuff to do.
DS54241	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	We're going to explore Shibuya!
DS54242	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 too bad... I wanted you to come explore
with us. See you around then!
DS54250	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You'll come with us	 right	 {NAME2}!?
DS54251	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Ooh	 yeah! You should come too!
DS54252	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Please come! I don't wanna go to cram school!
DS54253	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Okay kids	 don't hassle him too much	 okay?
DS54254	Inner Thoughts	Maybe I'll play with them
for a bit...
DS54255	Inner Thoughts	I told the kids to be careful
not to wander out of Haruna's
mom's sight.
DS54256	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Okay! We won't!
DS54257	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	All right!
DS54258	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	I'm sorry to bother you with this again...
DS54259	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So where are we gonna go? I want to see
somewhere new!
DS54260	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Why don't we let him decide? He probably
knows more than we do.
DS54261	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 that's a good idea! Okay	 {NAME2}
can take the lead!
DS54262	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Exploration team	 go!
DS54263	Inner Thoughts	I decided to go exploring
with Haruna and her friends.
DS54270	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I haven't been around here much before!
DS54271	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	We don't usually take this train line.
DS54272	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	I come here a lot running errands for my mom!
DS54273	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Do you come here a lot	 {NAME2}?
DS54274	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh yeah? What for?
DS54275	Choices	Shopping.|My part-time job.
DS54276	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	That makes sense! There are lots of shops
around here!
DS54277	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh yeah! High schoolers can work part-time!
Wow	 that sounds so fun!
DS54278	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hey	 so how late are these stores open?
How many people do you think work there?
DS54279	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	What time do they start work in the morning?
What do they do when things sell out?
DS54280	Inner Thoughts	Haruna's eyes are bright
with wonder. It's like she's
dying to know.
DS54281	Inner Thoughts	I told her what I know about
the stores and how they get
their stock.
DS54282	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Whoa! So that's how it works!?
That's so cool!
DS54283	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Hey	 Haruna-chan	 why do you think the
floor here has this kinda pattern?
DS54284	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Huh	 I wonder why! Maybe there's some
reason for it.
DS54285	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	You know	 I've seen floors with animal
footprint patterns on 'em before!
DS54286	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Ooh	 where? I wanna see!
DS54287	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Yuna-chan	 Kyo-kun! Don't go off too far!
You'll get lost!
DS54288	Inner Thoughts	I should make sure Haruna
sticks with her mom.
DS54289	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh no...
DS54290	D<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rk-Haired Boy	I'll just stay late at cram school and study.
Don't worry about dinner. I'll get something
from the convenience store.
DS54291	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's Mother	All right	 if you're sure. Just don't push
yourself too hard	 okay?
DS54292	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It's Shota-kun!
DS54293	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun!
DS54294	D<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>rk-Haired Boy	Haruna!?
DS54295	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's Mother	Oh	 Haruna-chan! It's been so long!
DS54296	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It's been forever!
DS54297	Choices	You know them?|Don't run off too far.
DS54298	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	This is my friend	 <color=#FF423F>Shota Ito</color>	 and his mom!
DS54299	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Who's that guy?
DS54300	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	This is my friend	 {NAME2}!
DS54301	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Who's that guy?
DS54302	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 this is a friend I made recently. {NAME2}!
DS54303	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	This is my friend	 <color=#FF423F>Shota Ito</color>	 and his mom!
DS54304	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	We're actually exploring right now!
Yuna-chan	 Kyo-kun	 and my mom are
here too!
DS54305	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Oh	 really! You're all together then!
DS54306	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hey	 Shota-kun! Why don't you come explore
with us too?
DS54307	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I can't... I have to get to cram school.
DS54308	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Huh? You're going already?
DS54309	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	He does this every day lately! He says he
wants to go early so he can study alone.
DS54310	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Shota	 why not go play with your friends?
Your cram school teacher says your grades
are good enough already.
DS54311	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Ooh	 really!?
DS54312	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You're aiming for a school with super high
standards	 right	 Shota-kun? That's great!
DS54313	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Nothing...
DS54314	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Compared to you	 it's barely anything.
DS54315	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Ah! There you are. Haruna!
DS54316	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Oh	 is that Ito-san!? It's been so long!
DS54317	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Nice to see you again	 Nishimori-san!
How have you been?
DS54318	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Where are you headed	 Ito-kun? Shopping?
DS54319	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	He's heading to cram school early.
DS54320	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Whoa	 seriously? Are you in love with school
or something? We never see you anymore.
DS54321	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	He can't help that the school he's trying to
get into has really high standards	 right?
DS54322	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But the cram school teacher said his grades
are already good enough to get in!
DS54323	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I'm gonna go. I've got studying to do.
DS54324	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun! Wait!
DS54325	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Shota	 wait	 honey! Don't go off by yourself!
DS54326	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	I'm sorry	 Nishimori-san! Excuse us!
DS54327	Inner Thoughts	It seems like there's
something going on here...
DS54328	Inner Thoughts	I asked Haruna if they
had a fight.
DS54329	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	No... Nothing like that.
DS54330	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	You know	 the Exploration Team actually used
to be just Haruna-chan and Ito-kun.
DS54331	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	Kyo-kun and I joined when we started
elementary school.
DS54332	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	But ever since we found out Haruna-chan got
into college	 Ito-kun stopped playing
with us.
DS54333	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Shota hates to lose. Maybe he's just jealous?
DS54334	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	But he's never gonna be like Nishimori	
no matter how much he studies.
DS54335	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	I'm sure you'll be able to make up before
you graduate!
DS54336	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hmmm...
DS54337	K<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>o	Hey	 let's go back to exploring! We've still
got time before cram school.
DS54338	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>na	That's right. Let's go	 Haruna-chan.
DS54339	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yeah... Okay!
DS54340	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Okay	 {NAME2}! Where to next?
DS54341	Inner Thoughts	I explored Shibuya with
Haruna and her friends.
DS54350	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Excuse me!
DS54351	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	You're the guy who was with Haruna
earlier	 right?
DS54352	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I have a favor to ask. Do you have a minute?
DS54353	Choices	What favor?|I'm kind of busy.
DS54354	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	There's something I want you to tell Haruna
for me.
DS54355	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Shota! Our table's ready!
DS54356	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Oh	 okay... That's fine.
DS54360	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Who's this?
DS54361	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Haruna's friend	 {NAME2}-san. He was
with everybody in Shibuya.
DS54362	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Oh	 that's right! Did you need something?
DS54363	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	There's something I want to tell Haruna	 so I
was going to ask him to get the message
to her.
DS54364	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	I see... But why don't you just let me tell
Haruna's mom whatever it is?
DS54365	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Because I can't!
DS54366	Choices	Why not?|You can't tell her yourself?
DS54367	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Well	 you see...
DS54368	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I want to tell her directly	 but...
DS54369	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I just can't.
DS54370	Inner Thoughts	He seems very troubled
about this...
DS54371	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Anyway	 our table's ready	 so why don't we
head inside?
DS54372	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	{NAME2}-san... Do you think you could
help him?
DS54373	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	This is the first time in ages I've heard him
talk about something besides school.
DS54374	Inner Thoughts	I decided to listen to 
Shota's troubles...
DS54380	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Shota has been friends with Haruna-chan
since kindergarten!
DS54381	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	I have so many photos of them on my phone.
Look how cute they were! Do you see?
DS54382	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Stop it	 Mom.
DS54383	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Ahaha	 sorry! But you two always got along
so well!
DS54384	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	You'd run around exploring	 and sit around
the house together playing with your puzzles
and riddle books.
DS54385	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Haruna-chan would figure things out so fast.
You were always frantic to keep up!
DS54386	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	That's not how it went! I'd figure out how to
solve things first	 then I'd teach Haruna.
DS54387	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Once she picked up the tricks	 she got
really fast...
DS54388	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Ah	 that's right. You did work out the
puzzles faster in the beginning.
DS54389	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	You're very good at school too	 Shota...
DS54390	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	But Haruna-chan's something else!
DS54391	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	I heard she was already discussing math
with college professors in first grade.
DS54392	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	I can't believe she's going to study at
a college in the US!
DS54393	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	At least she'll be staying in Japan until she
finishes elementary school.
DS54394	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Hey	 Mom	 could you just...
DS54395	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Oh	 I'm sorry! I've just been talking this
whole time.
DS54396	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	You wanted to talk to {NAME2}-san
after all. How about I leave you be for
a bit?
DS54397	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Yeah	 never mind...
DS54398	Choices	Haruna misses you.|What do you want to tell her?
DS54399	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I miss her too... I really do.
DS54400	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	She's always been really smart. I don't hate
her or resent her or anything.
DS54401	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	But skipping over middle and high school to
go straight to college... It's too far away.
DS54402	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I'm not as smart as she is. I feel like if I
don't study	 she's just going to keep getting
further and further away from me.
DS54403	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I hate feeling like I'm being left behind.
That's why I don't have time to play.
I need to study.
DS54404	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	So	 could you tell Haruna that I'm sorry I
can't play with her anymore?
DS54405	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I'm sorry I can't play with you anymore.
DS54406	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	That's all.
DS54407	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I'm not as smart as Haruna. I can't go off
to college in America.
DS54408	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	That's why I have to study now.
DS54409	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	She's always been really smart. I don't hate
her or resent her or anything.
DS54410	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	But skipping over middle and high school to
go straight to college... It's too far away.
DS54411	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	If I don't keep studying	 I feel like she'll
just get further and further away from me.
DS54412	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	And I can't stand feeling like I'm being
left behind.
DS54413	Inner Thoughts	I understand how Shota
feels	 but...
DS54414	Inner Thoughts	I'm not sure Haruna will be
convinced until she hears it
from him...
DS54415	Inner Thoughts	I told Shota he should tell
Haruna directly.
DS54416	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I'm telling you	 I just can't.
DS54417	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	When I try to look her in the eye and say
I've got to study	 I just panic and
freeze up	 so‚Äî
DS54418	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun! {NAME2}!
DS54419	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Haruna!?
DS54420	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun	 I saw your mom out front!
She said {NAME2} was here too!
DS54421	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You don't have cram school until later	
right? I came up with a new puzzle!
DS54422	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Do you want to try it	 Shota-kun? Maybe you
and {NAME2} can try togeth‚Äî
DS54423	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Uh...
DS54424	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	C-Cram school! Bye!
DS54425	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun!? Wait!
DS54426	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Haruna	 did something happen with Shota?
I just saw him run out of the building.
DS54427	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I asked him to do a puzzle	 and then he
said he was going to cram school...
DS54428	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I guess he really doesn't like this stuff
anymore... Puzzle stuff	 or "me" stuff...
DS54429	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	Don't worry! You postponed going to America
to work things out with him	 didn't you?
DS54430	H<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>runa's Mother	You have more than two years before you
graduate. I'm sure you'll make up by then!
DS54431	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But	 if we can't...
DS54432	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It'll be my fault	 won't it? All because I
decided to go to college...
DS54433	Inner Thoughts	I told Haruna about the
complex feelings Shota's
been grappling with.
DS54434	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Really?
DS54435	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So he doesn't hate me? Or puzzles?
DS54436	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I... still want to hang out with Shota-kun.
DS54437	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I want to learn about new things with him	
and explore new places with him...
DS54438	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I want us to do puzzles	 and challenges	
and uncover lots of mysteries together!
DS54439	Inner Thoughts	Haruna and Shota both really
miss having fun together...
DS54440	Choices	Why not gift him a puzzle?|Shota wants the same thing.
DS54441	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	...Okay.
DS54442	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Mom	 can I have something to write with?
DS54443	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'm gonna make some puzzles for Shota-kun!
Really good ones! Lots of 'em!
DS54444	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	He'll like that	 right...?
DS54445	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Then I'll do it! I'll try my best to make a
ton of really great puzzles for him!
DS54446	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Ooh	 what kind of puzzles though? I wonder
what Shota-kun would like best!
DS54447	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh! It should be like a treasure hunt!
Shota-kun's part of the Exploration Team
after all!
DS54448	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Maybe solving all the puzzles leads you to
the treasure? But where should we hide it?
Where do you think is good?
DS54449	Inner Thoughts	Haruna and I brainstormed
puzzle ideas for Shota.
DS54450	Inner Thoughts	I said goodbye to Haruna and
left the diner.
DS54451	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota's Mother	Shota has been friends with Haruna-chan
since kindergarten!
DS54452	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I guess he really doesn't like this stuff
anymore... Puzzle stuff	 or "me" stuff...
DS54453	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So he doesn't hate me? Or puzzles?
DS54454	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I... still want to hang out with Shota-kun.
DS54460	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh! It's {NAME2}!
DS54461	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Do you have time today?
DS54462	Choices	I have time.|Not now.
DS54463	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Look! Look at this!
DS54464	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh... That's too bad. Next time then!
DS54470	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I finished the puzzles for Shota-kun!
DS54471	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You have to find the treasure by exploring
Shibuya and solving riddles!
DS54472	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	They're all super tough	 but I'm sure that
won't be a problem for Shota-kun!
DS54473	Choices	Sounds challenging.|It looks like a treasure map.
DS54474	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Teeheehee! My mom said the same thing!
DS54475	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun's cram school is closed today	
and his mom agreed to help us!
DS54476	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	She said she's gonna bring him to
Shibuya today!
DS54477	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But I wanted to ask you...
DS54478	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Can you give this to Shota-kun for me	
{NAME2}?
DS54479	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'd really like to give it to him myself	 but
I'm afraid he won't take it.
DS54480	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Thanks!
DS54481	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 and you can solve the puzzles
with him too!
DS54482	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Except the last one. I made it so only
Shota-kun could know the answer.
DS54483	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I know he'll solve all of these for sure.
DS54484	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	My mom's at the diner right now!
DS54485	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	She's gonna call Shota-kun's mom and have
her bring him here!
DS54486	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Ah	 there he is!
DS54487	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'll be waiting by the treasure! I'm sure
Shota-kun will find it!
DS54488	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Don't forget to give him the thing!
DS54489	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Hey...
DS54490	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Uh	 are you the one who wanted to see me?
DS54491	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	My mom told me to come here for some
reason	 but...
DS54492	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Huh? What's this? Did you make this?
DS54493	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	These are puzzles from Haruna...?
DS54494	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I can't.
DS54495	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	There's no way I can solve puzzles this hard.
DS54496	Inner Thoughts	At first glance	 it looks like
a simple geometry
puzzle	 but...
DS54497	Inner Thoughts	It's scary difficult. This is
hard enough for a college
entrance exam.
DS54498	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	What's Haruna trying to do with this? Show
off how smart she is?
DS54499	Choices	She's waiting at the treasure.|You really think she'd do that?
DS54500	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Waiting? You mean she seriously thinks I
can solve these?
DS54501	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	No	 I don't. So	 you're saying...
DS54502	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Haruna really thinks I can solve all these?
DS54503	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	All right. I'll do it. If Haruna says I can
solve it	 I'll solve it.
DS54504	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I hate being stuck on a puzzle so I'll solve
it out no matter what.
DS54505	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Oh wait	 there are hints here? This might not
be so hard then. Hm...
DS54506	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	AAAAAA==
DS54507	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	AAAAAA==
DS54508	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	AAAAAA==
DS54510	Inner Thoughts	Shota's solving one puzzle
after another. The next
one is...
DS54511	Inner Thoughts	Move three matchsticks to
complete the crossword.
DS54512	Inner Thoughts	Hint: A shop in Shibuya's
underground mall.
DS54513	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Haruna's really good at making this kind of
puzzle	 huh?
DS54514	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	But I'm actually pretty good at them too.
And with a hint	 it's easy. The answer is...
DS54515	Inner Thoughts	Seems like Shota isn't
any less quick-thinking
than Haruna...
DS54516	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	All right	 done! Now for the last one!
DS54517	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Combine the first letter of each answer to
find the location of the treasure.
That's easy. It'd be...
DS54518	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	In	 front	 of	 the	 first	 bronze	 statue...?
DS54519	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	What is "first" supposed to mean? Was there
a bronze statue near the diner?
DS54520	Sho<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>a Ito	Maybe I got something wrong. Is there
a hint for this one?
DS54521	Inner Thoughts	The hint is "Exploration"...
DS54522	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I get it.
DS54523	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	It probably means in front of Buchiko.
DS54530	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Haruna!
DS54531	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shota-kun!
DS54532	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Congrats! You did it! So you solved the last
question	 huh!?
DS54533	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Solved it? That one wasn't really a puzzle!
DS54534	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	The plaza in front of Buchiko is just the
first place we explored together.
DS54535	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You remembered!
DS54536	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Duh! Of course I did. I mean...
DS54537	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You're finally talking to me like normal!
DS54538	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	I'm sorry...
DS54539	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	When I heard you were going off to college
in America	 I panicked.
DS54540	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	You're going so far away	 when I just want
to stay friends like this forever...
DS54541	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yeah... I'm sorry.
DS54542	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I just like math a lot	 and I'm good at it
too! And that means I've gotta go far away...
DS54543	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But I didn't realize how much you hate
losing	 Shota-kun.
DS54544	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	The way I see it	 no matter how far away
I go	 you're gonna catch up in the end.
Right?
DS54545	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So I think we'll still be friends forever.
DS54546	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	...Right.
DS54547	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	And I'm not going to college until I finish
elementary school anyway!
DS54548	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So there's loads of time for us to do stuff
together before that	 Shota-kun!
DS54549	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Sure!
DS54550	Inner Thoughts	Looks like they managed to make up.
DS54551	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hehehe!
DS54552	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	{NAME2}! Thank you for everything!
DS54553	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Will you come play with us again sometime?
DS54554	Choices	Sure.|Only if you teach me math.
DS54555	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yay	 yay	 yay! What should we do then!?
DS54556	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Huh!? You want to play another game already?
DS54557	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I've just been waiting here the whole time
while you guys were having fun!
I wanna play too!
DS54558	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yeah	 of course! We can all get together and
have a study party!
DS54559	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh right! Did you solve today's first
question	 {NAME2}?
DS54560	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I based it on a question from the national
university entrance exam!
DS54561	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	What!? You made me do a college level
math problem?
DS54562	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You solved it though	 right? So it's fine!
DS54563	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 by the way	 {NAME2}!
DS54564	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I've been spotting more mysterious stuff
every time I come to Shibuya!
DS54565	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Let's go exploring again!
DS54566	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'm sure we'll find something really
interesting!
DS54567	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ota Ito	Huh!? Haruna! Wait!
DS54568	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	C'mon! Hurry up!
DS54569	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	You're part of the Exploration Team too now	
right	 {NAME2}?
DS54570	Inner Thoughts	I explored Shibuya with
Haruna and Shota.
DS55000	Inner Thoughts	Students are chatting in
front of the Band Room...
DS55001	Inner Thoughts	I wonder if they're
band members...?
DS55002	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	Look	 it's not like we're starting from zero.
DS55003	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	We only need one more person	 right?
Everything will work out if we get one more.
DS55004	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	I don't even know where to look. At this
rate	 I'm willing to take the next person
who walks by.
DS55005	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	It's not like we're a karaoke club. It's hard
to recruit members for a band.
DS55006	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	We'll make it work! Just ask anyone who
looks like they've got nothing better to do...
DS55007	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	Like that guy over there!
DS55008	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	Hey! You look like you've got nothing better
to do!
DS55009	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	Wanna join the Band Club? We play music
together!
DS55010	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Whoa	 way too blunt. Plus	 telling him he's
got nothing better to do? Rude!
DS55011	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	I'm sorry	 you must be surprised getting
spoken to like that out of nowhere.
DS55012	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	We're the Band Club	 but we're short a
member	 so we can't form a decent band.
DS55013	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	It's ok if you have no experience playing
instruments. If you're interested	 we'd love
to have you.
DS55014	Inner Thoughts	I can join this club and
still participate in other
club activities...
DS55015	Inner Thoughts	Should I join the band club?
DS55016	Choices	If you insist...|I'd love to!
DS55017	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Really!? You'll join? The moment we started
asking random people	 we got a yes on the
first try!?
DS55018	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Oh. That sucks	 but it makes sense. It was
pretty sudden after all.
DS55019	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	But if you ever change your mind	 don't be
shy. We'd love to have you.
DS55020	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	There's no way we're going to recruit
enough members like this.
DS55021	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Obviously. Our sales pitch sounds like a
rip-off when you actually listen to it.
DS55022	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Hey	 it's you again. Wanna join our band now?
DS55023	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Please join our club! We'd be super happy to have you!
DS55024	Inner Thoughts	Should I join the band club?
DS55025	Choices	Sure.|Not just yet.
DS55026	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	Really!? You'll join? Thank you! Yes!
This is great!
DS55027	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	I see... Well	 I hope you reconsider.
DS55028	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	We'll be waiting. Stop by whenever if you
change your mind.
DS55030	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rious-Looking Girl	I'm <color=#FF423F>Ritsuka Takanashi</color>	 by the way.
I play the keyboard.
DS55031	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	And this is‚Äî
DS55032	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ud Girl	<color=#FF423F>Tsurumi Horikita</color>! Guitarist. Nice to meetcha!
DS55033	Inner Thoughts	I told her my name.
DS55034	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Happy to have you	 {NAME2}-kun.
We're short a bassist...
DS55035	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Have you ever played bass before	
{NAME2}-kun?
DS55036	Choices	Nope.|No experience. Just passion.
DS55037	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	No worries! Now let's get you signed up
before you change your mind!
DS55038	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Uh	 what she meant to say was	 we'll
get the papers ready and take them over
to the faculty office.
DS55039	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	I'm headin' into the club room then.
Gotta tell Taiko the good news!
DS55050	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	First things first. Thank you for joining
our club	 {NAME2}-kun.
DS55051	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I'm the club's vice president. Since it's
your first day	 I'll give you the rundown.
DS55052	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	This is our club room.
DS55053	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	We hold club activities here every day	 so
stop by whenever you feel like it.
DS55054	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	You're still free to participate in other
clubs too.
DS55055	D<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ummer	You the newbie Tsurumi talked about? You've
never touched a bass in your life	 right?
DS55056	D<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ummer	Well	 whatever. I'm <color=#FF423F>Taiko Saito</color>.
Drums.
DS55057	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Welcome	 I guess.
DS55058	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sorry if they sounded a little rude...
I promise they're not usually like that.
DS55059	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Tsurumi and I've done band club together
since we started high school.
DS55060	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Taiko's played in a band since middle school	
so she's pretty skilled.
DS55061	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	She probably just feels uneasy about your
lack of experience.
DS55062	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	But everyone starts from zero	 so don't take
it personally. I'll cover for you where
I can.
DS55063	A<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>vising Teacher	I'm <color=#FF423F>Higashino</color>	 the club advisor. I'm so glad
you joined our group!
DS55064	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Mr. Higashino composes music. He's even
won awards.
DS55065	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashi<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>o	Takanashi	 don't talk me up like that.
You know how I break under pressure.
DS55066	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashi<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>o	Well	 we're here to have fun and take it
easy. So don't push yourself too hard!
DS55067	Inner Thoughts	I met all the members of
the band club.
DS55068	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Just checking	 but you don't own any
instruments	 right?
DS55069	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Here	 you can borrow the club's bass.
Feel free to practice on it any time.
DS55070	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	All right	 let's have you practice playing
notes. First...
DS55071	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Hey	 Ritsuka! Could you lend me a hand?
DS55072	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Okay	 I'll be right there!
DS55073	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sorry	 one sec.
DS55074	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Okay	 let's try this again...
DS55075	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashi<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>o	Excuse me	 Takanashi. I've got a favor
to ask...
DS55076	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Coming!
DS55077	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sorry	 this won't take long!
DS55078	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Phew... Sorry to keep you waiting.
DS55079	Choices	Everyone relies on you.|Being vice president seems tough.|Are things always like this?
DS55080	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I'm happy everyone relies on me	 but it's
hard to keep it up all the time. Haha...
DS55081	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Yeah	 but I'm the vice president	 not some
errand girl. What a pain. Haha...
DS55082	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Not always	 but Tsurumi and Mr. Higashino
come to me the moment they need something.
DS55083	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Even though I told them I'd be busy helping
you today.
DS55084	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Seems like things have calmed down now.
Okay	 let's teach you how to play.
DS55085	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Got an idea of how to play now?
DS55086	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Yes	 that's the idea!
DS55087	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Let's try playing together. Don't worry	
we'll start with an easy song.
DS55090	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	That was excellent! Is this really your
first time?
DS55091	Choices	You were even better.|You sounded great on lead keyboard.
DS55092	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I only joined band club in high school	
but I've played piano since I was little.
DS55093	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	My mom studied piano at a music conservatory.
We had a piano at home	 so naturally I
learned too.
DS55094	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I kept playing piano until middle school. But
once I started high school and went to the
club fair...
DS55095	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I saw the band club perform. All the members
from back then have already graduated now.
DS55096	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Hearing them play	 I thought	 "I want to
perform freely and full of joy the way
they do."
DS55097	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	From that day on I decided to become a
keyboardist.
DS55098	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	My mom seemed to be a little disappointed
about it though.
DS55099	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Ah	 sorry for rambling on about myself.
DS55100	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I think you've got talent	 {NAME2}-kun!
Despite being a beginner	 you play
really well.
DS55101	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Oh	 it's getting late. Let's wrap up practice
for today.
DS55102	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	See you later. Feel free to practice at your
own pace. I'm just happy you joined.
DS55110	Inner Thoughts	I joined band practice.
DS55111	Inner Thoughts	I can use this time to
practice solo or as a duo.
DS55112	Inner Thoughts	The drummer and guitarist
don't seem very into
it though...
DS55113	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Sorry	 I need to get some air.
DS55114	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Ah	 I should go grab something to drink!
DS55115	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Oh...
DS55116	Choices	What's up with Saito?|What's up with Horikita?
DS55117	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Good question... Seems like she's
having trouble focusing.
DS55118	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	She's fine. I think she's just worried about
why Taiko's so antsy.
DS55119	Choices	Is it because I suck?|Am I not practicing enough?
DS55120	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	No	 you're doing great	 {NAME1}-kun.
DS55121	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I don't think that's what Taiko's worried
about.
DS55122	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Sorry to keep everyone waiting. Should we all
practice together now?
DS55123	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Yeah! Let's do it!
DS55124	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Ah	 oops!
DS55125	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Not your fault. My count was off. What a
rookie mistake. My bad.
DS55126	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Today's just not my day. Sorry	 Ritsuka	 but
I'm gonna head home early.
DS55127	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	No worries. Mind if we chat a bit before
you go?
DS55128	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	...Sure.
DS55129	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Tsurumi	 {NAME1}-kun	 you two practice on
your own for a bit.
DS55130	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Did you know Taiko was in
a band in middle school?
DS55131	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	I heard they were good enough to work
freelance gigs.
DS55132	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	They recently lost their current drummer	
so apparently they asked Taiko to come back.
DS55133	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	She turned them down at first	 but she seems
really lost on what to do.
DS55134	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	We barely have enough members for our club
as it is	 and we're small fries compared
to them.
DS55135	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Ugh! I can't stop thinking about it. I can't
focus like this!
DS55136	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Damn! I just remembered my mom asked me
to stop by the post office today!
DS55137	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	It's about to close! I gotta go. Tell Ritsuka
and the others I had an errand to run!
DS55138	Inner Thoughts	I'm all by myself now...
DS55139	Inner Thoughts	I'll practice more while
I wait for Ritsuka to
come back.
DS55140	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Huh? Where's Tsurumi?
DS55141	Inner Thoughts	I told her she left to run
an errand.
DS55142	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I see. Sorry for making you practice all
by yourself.
DS55143	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Taiko is fine for now. I was able to find out
what she's so hung up on...
DS55144	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	She's not in the best mental space right now	
so I let her go home early.
DS55145	Inner Thoughts	Her previous band inviting her
to rejoin must be what's
bothering her...
DS55146	Inner Thoughts	I told Ritsuka everything
Horikita told me.
DS55147	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Ah	 so you heard about it from Tsurumi.
Taiko already refused the band's offer
though.
DS55148	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	She's thinking she wants to stay with our
club and not go back to her old band.
DS55149	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It's just...
DS55150	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I want to confirm with you	 {NAME1}-kun...
DS55151	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	How do you feel about the club so far?
No bad experiences	 surprises	 or anything
like that	 right?
DS55152	Choices	It's fun.|I feel motivated.|I like getting to see you.
DS55153	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Really? I'm so happy to hear that!
DS55154	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Yeah	 I can see that! You're improving at
an impressive rate.
DS55155	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Huh!? Um	 thanks! Well	 I'm glad you're
having fun.
DS55156	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	But I don't think Taiko is... Hm...
What should I do?
DS55157	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	If that's how it's gonna be...
DS55158	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I got it!
DS55159	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Yes. As club vice president I have to lend
a hand!
DS55160	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	*gasp*
DS55161	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sorry for the yelling. That must have
surprised you.
DS55162	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	You know when you think too hard and
everything gets all jumbled up in your head?
DS55163	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	When that happens	 I find it helps to yell
real loud like a hard reset.
DS55164	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It helps me come up with a good solution.
DS55165	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	So just leave the rest to me.
DS55166	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	School's almost over	 so let's stop practice
for today and clean up.
DS55167	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	If you want	 we can walk to the station
together?
DS55168	Inner Thoughts	Ritsuka and I finished tidying
the club room and walked to
the station together.
DS55170	Inner Thoughts	There are lots of snacks
lined up...
DS55171	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Wow! What's with all the snacks?
DS55172	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	We still haven't had a welcome party for
{NAME1}-kun yet	 right?
DS55173	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I thought we could have a snack party
during our club time today.
DS55174	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I've gotten the chance to talk to
{NAME1}-kun while teaching him bass	 but
you two don't know him that well yet	 right?
DS55175	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	So	 I thought now would be a great chance for
you guys to get to know him better.
DS55176	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	I love it! Snack n' Chat Meet n' Greet!
DS55177	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Well	 if it's a welcome party	 then sure.
DS55178	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	{NAME1}-kun	 no objections	 right?
DS55180	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Whoa! You're living by yourself now	
{NAME1}-kun?
DS55181	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I thought you learned the new songs pretty
fast	 but you practiced at home too	 huh?
DS55182	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Your owl pecks you when you miss a note?
For real? That's hilarious!
DS55183	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Smart owl. Sounds like a great coach!
DS55184	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I need to apologize	 {NAME1}-kun.
I misunderstood you this whole time.
DS55185	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I didn't trust a second year with no musical
experience suddenly joining our club.
DS55186	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	But you seem like a good guy	 {NAME1}-kun	
and you didn't turn down Tsurumi's forceful
recruitment tactics either.
DS55187	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Hey! I wasn't that forceful!
DS55188	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Tsurumi	 maybe let's just listen for a sec.
DS55189	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Considering the band couldn't exist without
you	 it must've been hard to refuse.
DS55190	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	For a year now	 our goal as a club has been
to perform in a competition.
DS55191	Tai<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>o Saito	If you weren't with us	 {NAME1}-kun	
we would never be able to achieve our goal.
DS55192	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	But Ritsuka and I should have told you
before. It is an option to quit if you really
want to.
DS55193	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	But after talking to you today...
DS55194	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I feel like you're really enjoying yourself
as a member of our club	 {NAME1}-kun.
DS55195	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	You even practice at home	 which means
you must be motivated!
DS55196	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	At this rate	 you'll be better than me!
DS55197	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	But thank god! I was sure Taiko was gonna
go back to her old band...
DS55198	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Oh... Nah	 that's not happening. Sure that
band performs at a high level	 but...
DS55199	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	They only care about results. We never got
to chow down on snacks and chat and stuff
in that group	 you know?
DS55200	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I don't think the high-pressure vibe
suits me.
DS55201	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Our club does revolve around having fun
and relaxing.
DS55210	Inner Thoughts	Mr. Higashino discovered
our snack party.
DS55211	Inner Thoughts	I wonder if he'll get mad
at us...
DS55212	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Ooh!
DS55213	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	How could you!? Starting the party without
me!?
DS55214	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	You said you'd be late today because of the
staff meeting...
DS55215	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Are any of my favorite marshmallows left?
DS55216	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	The bag isn't even open yet!
DS55217	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Today's the welcome party for {NAME1}-kun	
right? Welcome to the club! How are you 
finding it? All settled in?
DS55218	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Ummm... We already did the whole "welcome	
blah blah" thing.
DS55219	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Well darn!
DS55220	Inner Thoughts	Mr. Higashino joined in
on the fun.
DS55221	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Oh	 Mr. Higashino	 could you do the paperwork
for us to perform in the competition?
DS55222	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	We have {NAME1}-kun now	 so we have
enough members to compete.
DS55223	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Oh yeah! That contest is super soon.
The High School Battle of the Bands!
DS55224	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	It's just a small local competition	 but it's
going to be our first one ever.
DS55225	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Oh really? In that case	 won't you need
some original music to perform?
DS55226	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Of course!
DS55227	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Better to have something...
DS55228	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	...than nothing.
DS55229	Choices	Of course we need it!|We're counting on you.
DS55230	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	But it's been so long since I've written
music. Wonder if I've still got it in me...
DS55231	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	You're part of the club too	 Mr. Higashino.
I want our band to debut with one of
your songs.
DS55232	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Okay! I understand.
DS55240	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It looks like Mr. Higashino's confined
himself to the prep room and
started composing.
DS55241	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	He always worried we'd never get the chance
to debut in a competition when there were
only three of us.
DS55242	Choices	Snack parties get results.|Let's aim for the top together.
DS55243	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Yeah	 I'm really glad we did that. Taiko and
Tsurumi are on board now too.
DS55244	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Thanks for being so on board with this.
DS55245	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	All right...
DS55246	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I got it!
DS55247	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	*gasp*
DS55248	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sorry	 everything was so perfect that I got a
sudden surge of energy!
DS55249	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Oh	 there it is. Ritsuka's famous	
I got it!
DS55250	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Hey	 Tsurumi and I were thinking that since
we're all here	 we could play together once
before heading home.
DS55251	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sounds great! Care to join us	 {NAME1}-kun?
DS55260	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Wow	 we were totally in sync!
DS55261	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Again	 welcome to the band	 {NAME1}-kun.
DS55262	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Okay then	 we're gonna head out. See you
all tomorrow!
DS55263	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Hey	 wanna walk back to the station together?
DS55264	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	There's still so much I wanna talk to
you about.
DS55265	Inner Thoughts	I chatted with Ritsuka as we
walked to the station.
DS55270	Inner Thoughts	I arrived at band practice.
DS55271	Inner Thoughts	But I don't see Ritsuka
anywhere...
DS55272	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Hey. Ritsuka's in the prep room.
DS55273	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	She's helping Mr. Higashino compose music
for us.
DS55274	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	{NAME1}-kun. You're here!
DS55275	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Right. Now that we're all here	 let's do some
group practice.
DS55276	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Good! Not bad at all!
DS55277	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	With the rate we're going	 I'd like to start
practicing our competition song.
DS55278	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I think it will be ready soon...
DS55279	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It looks like it'll be a great song.
DS55280	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Yay! I can't wait!
DS55290	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sorry I missed out on the first half of
club time.
DS55291	Choices	Is it hard helping the teacher?|You're helping write the new song?
DS55292	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Not at all. Mr. Higashino composes great
music	 so I'm excited to see what he comes
up with.
DS55293	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Only thing is	 he has a bit of an indecisive
streak.
DS55294	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I play the melodies he writes on
my keyboard...
DS55295	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	He rewrites the melody after seeing how I
performed it	 and we repeat that process.
DS55296	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	But he can be a bit indecisive.
DS55297	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	So I tell him that the song is turning out
really well to help push him forward.
DS55298	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I told you I studied piano before	 right?
DS55299	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	My mom is a professor at a music school	
and a teacher there used to give me lessons.
DS55300	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	That music teacher also taught me a bit
about composition.
DS55301	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	They said if I want to be a musician like my
mom	 I should really learn how to compose.
DS55302	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	But I've never released an original song I
composed for the world to see.
DS55303	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I've only really scratched the surface.
DS55304	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	But it makes me happy I can use my
knowledge to support Mr. Higashino.
DS55305	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	A skill I never thought I'd use turned out to
be helpful to the Band Club.
DS55306	Choices	You don't want to compose music?|I want to play a song you wrote.
DS55307	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Not really... Like I said	 I only learned a
little tiny bit about composing.
DS55308	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I don't have the skills to create an entire
song on my own.
DS55309	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Huh?
DS55310	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Well	 I'm happy you feel that way	 but...
DS55311	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Like I said	 I only learned a little bit
about composing.
DS55312	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I don't have the skills to create an entire
song on my own.
DS55313	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	More importantly	 I want to focus my skills
on performing well at the competition.
DS55314	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It's a small contest	 but getting to have fun
performing with a nice band of friends...
DS55315	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	...is the perfect goal for our club to have.
DS55316	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	I get you! Aiming to be best in the country
or whatever is just so not us.
DS55317	Tsurumi Ho<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ikita	If the band gets too serious and stops being
fun	 then what's the point	 right!?
DS55318	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	If anything	 we should try not to get too
invested in the outcome of our first
competition.
DS55320	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Okay	 I'm almost done with the song! All
that's left are the finishing touches!
DS55321	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Wait... Takanashi	 what time is it!?
DS55322	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Um... About thirty minutes till the school
day ends.
DS55323	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Oh no! I forgot the vice principal wanted
to meet with me!
DS55324	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Ah! Gotta hurry!
DS55325	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Please lock the club room on your way out!
I gotta run!
DS55326	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Okay! Take care	 Mr. Higashino.
DS55327	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Damn	 he took the song with him. I really
wanted to get a peek at it.
DS55328	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Well	 he said he just needs to add the
finishing touches	 so hopefully he'll show
us next time.
DS55329	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Hopefully! Guess we'll have to wait till
next week. So exciting!
DS55330	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	As long as he doesn't forget the song
at home.
DS55331	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Haha... That happened last time...
DS55332	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Mr. Higashino is a good person	 but he's
kind of scatterbrained.
DS55333	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Oh! Remember that one time in class?
DS55334	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Mr. Higashino pulled a chocolate pretzel
stick out of his bag thinking it was a pen!
DS55335	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Oh	 do you think that might be from...
DS55336	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Yeah	 he said he was "curious about the
flavor" at our snack party.
DS55337	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Well	 Mr. Higashino has come this far thanks
to Ritsuka's support.
DS55338	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	You're giving me too much credit.
DS55339	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	No	 I think she has a point.
DS55340	Inner Thoughts	We finished today's club
activities with a fun and
relaxed atmosphere.
DS55341	Inner Thoughts	We can start practicing for
the competition soon. I should
keep coming to rehearsal...
DS55350	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	No	 it's not here! Not anywhere!
Mr. Higashino	 are you sure you lost it
in the club room?
DS55351	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	You didn't leave it at home?
DS55352	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I searched all over my house for it last
night	 and I couldn't find it anywhere!
DS55353	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	What about the faculty office?
DS55354	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Of course	 I searched every corner there
too	 and still nothing.
DS55355	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I even looked in the prep room and it
wasn't there either...
DS55356	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun	 perfect timing! We need
your help!
DS55357	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Mr. Higashino lost the song he composed
for the competition!
DS55358	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I'm so ashamed of myself! I'm so sorry	
everyone!
DS55359	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It's not here.
DS55360	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Let's take a break.
DS55361	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I'm sorry... everyone...
DS55362	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I haven't looked enough. I'll search my
house one more time.
DS55363	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Oh! I should ask my housekeeper to look...
DS55364	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Didn't you say you already looked there
yesterday?
DS55365	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Also	 isn't your house a studio apartment?
DS55366	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Compared to that little space	 it's more
likely lost somewhere in the school.
DS55367	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	I can't believe you hire someone to clean
your tiny apartment.
DS55368	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	*groan*
DS55369	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	What should we do? Any ideas	 {NAME1}-kun?
DS55370	Choices	Are there any copies?|Is it backed up on a computer?
DS55371	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I thought about making one	 but...
DS55372	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I lost it before I could.
DS55373	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I'm all analog...
DS55374	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I know that's rare these days.
DS55375	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Ugh	 this sucks. The only copy exists in
Mr. Higashino's head...
DS55376	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Can you rewrite it from memory?
DS55377	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Uh	 I guess I'll have to try... But I doubt
it will match the original.
DS55378	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Some of the measures were hatched in sudden
bursts of inspiration	 so...
DS55379	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Ugh! And just when I finally had the perfect
song for everyone's contest debut!
DS55380	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Uhuhuh... Uwaaaaagh!
DS55381	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Wait	 don't cry	 Mr. Higashino!
DS55382	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Keep it together!
DS55383	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	There's no way he can rewrite it in
this state...
DS55384	Choices	Takanashi should rewrite it.|Do you remember the melody	 Takanashi?
DS55385	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	What!? Sure I played it once to help him out	
but...
DS55386	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I did play it once	 so there are some parts
I remember	 but...
DS55387	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It won't be perfect...
DS55388	Choices	I believe in you.|You're our only hope.
DS55389	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	......
DS55390	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Hm...
DS55391	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I got it!
DS55392	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Mr. Higashino	 wait right there!
DS55393	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	You recreated the first page perfectly!
DS55394	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Amazing! I knew you could do it	 Ritsuka.
DS55395	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Even though I was just helping with the
composition	 I managed to rewrite it.
DS55396	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I heard Mr. Higashino play it so many times	
there's no way I couldn't remember it.
DS55397	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	......
DS55398	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Oh! Maybe if I heard you all play this...
We worked so hard on this song...
DS55399	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	There's no way I can't remember the rest!
DS55400	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	You students are working so hard. As your
teacher	 I can't be so irresponsible anymore.
DS55401	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I'm going to rewrite the song from memory
today! Leave it to me!
DS55402	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	I did it! A perfect copy!
DS55403	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Awesome!
DS55404	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I knew you could do it!
DS55405	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I'm going to make copies for everyone	 and
then we can play!
DS55406	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Let's make up for the time we lost searching!
DS55407	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	What a great song!
DS55408	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	It's perfect for our band... Let's finally
play it together.
DS55409	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Everyone ready? {NAME1}-kun?
DS55410	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	What'd you guys think?
DS55411	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	We're far from perfect	 but I think it could
win us the competition.
DS55412	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Win!? No way! That'd be awesome!
DS55413	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	I didn't say we will win. I said we "could."
DS55414	Choices	It's all thanks to Takanashi.|I'm glad Takanashi could remember it.
DS55415	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	For real! We owe it all to her!
DS55416	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	I mean‚Äî! Of course Mr. Higashino worked
really hard too!
DS55417	M<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>. Higashino	Not at all. Without Ritsuka's help	
I would've thrown in the towel.
DS55418	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I only was able to pull it off because of
{NAME1}-kun's encouragement.
DS55419	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Ritsuka	 ever since {NAME1}-kun came along	
you've been a lot more optimistic.
DS55420	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Actually	 not just Ritsuka	 but all of us.
The whole club is more positive...
Cheerful even!
DS55421	T<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>urumi Horikita	Oh yeah	 I totally feel that!
DS55422	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Nah	 you were like that before	 Tsurumi.
DS55423	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>iko Saito	Thank you for joining our club	
{NAME1}-kun.
DS55424	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I know Taiko already said this	 but...
DS55425	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I'm also really grateful you came along	 {NAME1}-kun.
DS55426	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	I kind of have a tendency to
overthink things.
DS55427	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	But you listen to me	 {NAME1}-kun.
DS55428	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	And you help push me forward.
DS55429	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Now I feel like I can tackle things without
so much weight on my shoulders anymore.
DS55430	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Thanks to you I feel like I can go after
things I never thought I could handle before.
DS55431	Choices	Let's keep at it together.|You got it!
DS55432	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Yeah	 for sure!
DS55433	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Hehe! I won't hold back.
DS55434	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	We'll nail this contest!
DS55435	Inner Thoughts	The band club has united
as one.
DS55436	Inner Thoughts	Let's keep up the hard work
for the competition!

let's listen to them together!
DS63010	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63010]	Sure	 I'll listen.|Maybe another time.
DS63011	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahaha	 lemme show you around!
DS63012	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Your muscles will always be there for you!
Never forget to speak with them!
DS63013	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Look at that lineup of machines	 just waitin'
to be used... Better than any amusement park
or dreamworld any day	 am I right?
DS63014	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	What's that? "I wanna get training already"?
When can we lift those weights?
DS63015	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahahaha! Even those pecs of yours can barely
contain their excitement!
DS63016	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Now then	 the world is your oyster! Let's do
whatever your muscles want to do!
DS63017	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n with a Pumped Chest	Hey	 Anderson-san. You free after this?
DS63018	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n with Shredded Thighs	We're going to a mixer	 but a friend of ours
had to drop out. Wanna take his place?
DS63019	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hmm... Sorry	 but I've got a date with my
lats and lumbar extensors today.
DS63020	Man wi<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>h a Pumped Chest	You talkin' to your muscles again? Still as
disciplined as ever	 I see.
DS63021	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n with Shredded Thighs	Hahaha	 I had a feelin' you wouldn't be
joinin'. Welp	 we're all done here then.
Good pump today!
DS63022	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63022Key]	The men left the gym...
DS63023	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I feel bad	 but I'm the only one who can make
my muscles happy...
DS63024	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Be true to your muscles	 my friend	
and they'll absolutely respond in kind!
DS63025	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hard work will always bear fruit...
That's right! A massive fruit we call gains!
DS63026	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	So let's make your muscles melon-sized!
We're gonna target the whole body today.
DS63027	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Sorry	 got a call...!
DS63028	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hello	 Anderson speaking! Oh that's right	
we spoke before...
DS63029	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	No	 of course not. I don't mind at all. I'm
in the middle of something now	 but we could
meet afterwards...
DS63030	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Okay! I'll see you at the square in front of
Shibuya Station then! I'll head right on over
when I'm done.
DS63031	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahahaha! Looks like I'm gonna go meet up
with a lady by the station.
DS63032	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	...Would you mind coming with me	 friend?
DS63033	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63033]	Is she your girlfriend?|What about our workout...?
DS63034	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I made a promise to some other muscles...
This lady came up to me the other day and
said she wanted to try working out.
DS63035	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	We exchanged contact info	 and now she's in
the area and wants to meet up.
DS63036	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63036]	Sounds like she's asking you out.|Maybe you should go alone?
DS63037	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahaha... Well you see	 I haven't had many
chances to talk to women in my lifetime.
DS63038	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Maybe it's because I'm always listening to my
muscles	 but women excuse themselves pretty
soon after we get to chatting.
DS63039	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Despite that... I still need to talk to her.
DS63040	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Her muscles were screaming so loud on the day
I met her.
DS63041	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Please help her! they cried.
DS63042	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	To think her muscles were feeling such
distress that only I could hear... I want to
help her... and her muscles.
DS63043	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	That's not to say I don't hope that it leads
to romance	 am I right!? Hahahaha!
DS63044	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	That's why I want you to come with me	
even if all you do is act as my spotter from
somewhere nearby!
DS63045	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But there's still some time before she
gets there	 so I'll give my lats that pump
I promised them and head over.
DS63046	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	You go ahead and wait for me at the
station square. Oh	 hold on	 I'll walk you
downstairs!
DS63047	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	It would be great to have your help on this
mission to save this lady's muscles!
DS63048	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey	 friend! I'm glad you came. She's on her
way here right now.
DS63049	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	My heart is pounding so hard... But the heart
is a muscle too	 so it's like I'm getting
another workout in!
DS63050	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	This time	 you're gonna be my personal
trainer! Observe my cardiac muscle's
heroic performance!
DS63051	Meek-Looking Woman	Hello	 it's been a while... Do you still
remember me?
DS63052	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Of course! It's great to see you again!
And how have you been	 little muscles?
DS63053	Meek-Looking Woman	Hahaha... I see you still have that thing
for muscles...
DS63054	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oops	 sorry... I forgot that talking directly
to a woman's muscles can scare her off.
DS63055	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh	 please don't slouch like that. It slows
circulation	 which is bad for your muscles
and can make you feel cold more often.
DS63056	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63056Key]	It seems Anderson is
like that with everyone...
DS63057	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Of course	 the best thing for circulation is
weight training! How about it? The gym is
empty around this time.
DS63058	Meek-Looking Woman	I'm actually in the middle of my workday...
Besides	 I haven't had the time to work out
lately even if I wanted to.
DS63059	Meek-Looking Woman	But... I wanted to at least talk to you since
you know so much about muscles.
DS63060	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh	 you did? Well	 there's no need to feel
bad about taking some down time.
DS63061	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	A healthy diet	 work-life balance	 and
exercise will have your muscles singing
in no time!
DS63062	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	If something is holding you back	 removing it
is the first step toward good health!
DS63063	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63063Key]	Anderson seems to be very
concerned about this woman...
DS63064	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Whatever's bothering you	 I don't mind
getting an ear workout in. I'll use my
muscles to help any way I can!
DS63065	Meek-Looking Woman	That's very kind of you. How about we do
something when we're both free? Maybe even...
go on a date...?
DS63066	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	A d-d-date!? You said date and not
deadlift	 right?
DS63067	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	R-Right. I'd be happy to! I'll find us a spot
with a protein-rich menu!
DS63068	Meek-Looking Woman	Protein...? S-Sure	 that sounds good.
Oh	 I have to get back to work now	 but I'll
be in touch.
DS63069	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63069Key]	Anderson arranged a date with
the woman and saw her off...
DS63070	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I was so nervous I thought my heart would
explode! Look	 my muscles are all pumped up!
DS63071	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I probably would've tapped out if I were all
alone... It was so encouraging knowing you
were by my side!
DS63072	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63072]	You're welcome.|Are you okay with a date?
DS63073	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Her muscles seemed pretty grateful when I
agreed to go out with her.
DS63074	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I want to relieve her stress and make her
muscles bigger	 healthier	 and happier.
DS63075	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But unfortunately	 I have no experience going
on dates with women... Do you have any good
tips	 friend?
DS63076	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63076]	Go somewhere peaceful to talk.|Find a quiet place to relax.
DS63077	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Way to go	 friend! That's it! I'll find a
tranquil place where I can help solve
her problems!
DS63078	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Somewhere we could get some steps in would be
good too... Hmm	 around Zoshigaya might do
the trick.
DS63079	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Huh...? Your muscles are trying to tell me
something... Are you familiar with Zoshigaya?
DS63080	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahahaha! This must be fate then. You're like an
open squat rack after 5 PM!
DS63081	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Okay	 friend! Let's plan a walking date
course together that will really work
her muscles!
DS63082	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Looking forward to seeing those guns of yours
again in Zoshigaya!
DS63083	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63083Key]	I helped plan the course with
Anderson. He seems like he's
going to ask her right away...
DS63084	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey	 friend! She's on her way here right now.
DS63085	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	This is the walking course we came up with.
My muscles are confident it'll be a success!
DS63086	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63086]	Good luck.|I hope it works out.
DS63087	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Thanks! It's bound to go well! Just watch
my form	 friend!
DS63088	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	*sigh* Isn't walking great? I can feel the
blood flowing all the way to my fingers
and toes.
DS63089	Meek-Looking Woman	R-Right... Even a simple walk... can be good
for your health.
DS63090	Meek-Looking Woman	Thank you... very much for introducing me...
to such a wonderful route...
DS63091	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I worked with a friend to come up with it.
Walking is one of the best exercises for
your muscles!
DS63092	Meek-Looking Woman	Really...? Thank you for... putting in
so much effort...
DS63093	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Now that we've warmed up our muscles...
can you tell me what's troubling you?
DS63094	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63094Key]	The woman tensed up...
DS63095	Meek-Looking Woman	I-I'm sorry... I... umm...
DS63096	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Don't be shy. It's clear your muscles have
wanted to tell me something for a while now.
DS63097	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63097Key]	The woman looks absolutely
terrified by what Anderson
just said...
DS63098	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh	 it's not what you think. I just overheard
the voice of your muscles	 and...
DS63099	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Sorry... I just wanted to give you a ripped
shoulder to lean on... How about we take
a break somewhere to‚Äî
DS63100	Meek-Looking Woman	N-No... I should be the one who's sorry!
I only approached you... to swindle you!
DS63101	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Swindle... me? What do you mean?
DS63102	Meek-Looking Woman	I-I work for a company that sells expensive
health equipment at horrendous prices.
DS63103	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I see... Go on.
DS63104	Meek-Looking Woman	Okay...
DS63105	Meek-Looking Woman	You happened to catch my boss's eye	
so he told me to make you sign a contract.
DS63106	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hmm...
DS63107	Meek-Looking Woman	I don't really have a choice... He docks
my wages if I can't get a signature...
DS63108	Meek-Looking Woman	But I can't bear to keep deceiving people
like this anymore	 so I asked to be
transferred to another position.
DS63109	Meek-Looking Woman	And he promised me he would if I could get
one last contract...
DS63110	Meek-Looking Woman	And that would be with you. But you've been
so kind to me	 I can't do this...
DS63111	Meek-Looking Woman	I'm so sorry. I... I really don't know what
to do...
DS63112	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63112Key]	Anderson seems deep
in thought...
DS63113	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	How about this? I'll sign the contract
as you originally planned. That'll fix
everything!
DS63114	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey there	 friend!
DS63115	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	If you ever want to talk muscles with me	
come by any time!
DS63116	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey there	 friend!
DS63117	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	The best way to listen to your muscles is to
work out. I'll always be waiting here!
DS63118	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Ogiwara	They'll do anything for me if it makes me
happy. Why am I being criticized?
DS63119	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey	 friend! Did you hear? I helped her
close her final contract!
DS63120	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	That should boost the health of her muscles
dramatically. Problem solved!
DS63121	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63121]	Are you sure that was a good idea?|Didn't she just trick you?
DS63122	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahahaha! You underestimate me	 friend.
Don't you worry!
DS63123	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I'd been saving up to buy a new machine.
If I raid my savings	 I'm sure I can make
it work.
DS63124	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	And besides	 I could tell her muscles were
so grateful to me as we were leaving.
DS63125	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Thank you, they said. "You were a huge help."
DS63126	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Muscles tell it like it is! The moment I
offered to help	 I heard them finally relax!
DS63127	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	If she was lying	 her muscles would be
cackling up a storm	 not feeling relieved.
DS63128	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	She wasn't lying	 I'd bet my muscles on it.
Don't you think that's enough?
DS63129	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63129]	Is it enough for you?|Not really	 no.
DS63130	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh	 don't tell me you're worried about me.
...That's very kind of you	 friend.
DS63131	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But there's no need	 because I have you as
my wonderful personal trainer by my side!
DS63132	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh	 it's almost time for work and I just took
out a big loan	 so I need to get fired up.
DS63133	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh? Is this hers!?
DS63134	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	What the heck? I can't believe I didn't
notice she dropped this!
DS63135	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Sorry	 but could you deliver it for me?
This must be important to her.
DS63136	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Her company's near the movie theater in
Shibuya. She said she was going to meet
her boss.
DS63137	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I'll message her as well. I'm counting on
you	 friend!
DS63138	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63138Key]	I received the woman's lost
property from Anderson.
DS63139	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63139Key]	Her company is near the movie
theater in Shibuya. I should
go pay it a visit...

Anderson the overpriced
fitness equipment...

to him with tears in her eyes.

muscle! See? It went just as I said it would.
DS63144	Meek-Looking Woman	U-Um	 sir... I got that last contract as
promised	 so...
DS63145	Meek-Looking Woman	You're going to transfer me to another
department now	 right?
DS63146	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ss-like Man	Hmm? What's that? Sorry	 I can't hear you
when you mumble like that... Hey	 your phone
keeps goin' off. You gonna check it?
DS63147	Meek-Looking Woman	It's... They're messages from that man...
A-Anderson-san...
DS63148	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ss-like Man	Hahaha! So you ignore 'em as soon as they
sign	 huh!? You really are perfect for our
sales team! Keep up the good work!
DS63149	Meek-Looking Woman	I thought this would be the last time	 so I
even got him to take out a loan for it...
DS63150	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ss-like Man	I'm gonna head back to grab my stuff. And you
can get to work finding us another sucker.
Maybe an old lady this time.
DS63151	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ss-like Man	Ahaha	 hold up! Your mascara's running!
That's hilarious! Can I take a video?
DS63152	Meek-Looking Woman	......

have been fooled... I need to
talk to that woman.

the same thing as I am	 anyway!

her desires	 if nothing else. Now let's
finish this.

Why am I the one being condemned	 now?
DS63164	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow Ogiwara	My heart was played with so many times...

favorite!

DS63170	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Beauty may betray you	 but muscles never lie!
Just put in the work and you get the results!
DS63171	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Don't you think so	 friend?
DS63172	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Yes	 yes	 I knew you'd agree!
DS63173	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Your muscles seem delighted. You must be
getting in some good workouts!
DS63174	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I mean	 just look at them! The firmness	
the sheen	 the definition of these muscles...
Is that not the ultimate result?
DS63175	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hmm? What's wrong? Is there something you
want to talk about?
DS63176	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63176]	How did the contract go?|Did the woman call you?
DS63177	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hmm? Oh that. We terminated the contract for
the training equipment	 no prob.
DS63178	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	She called me later	 actually. Said she used
a cooling-off period to cancel it without
telling her boss.
DS63179	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Apparently	 she's quitting her job and going
back to her hometown. A wise move by the
sound of it.
DS63180	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Speaking of which	 I decided to confess my
feelings to her since it was probably my
last chance...
DS63181	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	She rejected me unfortunately. Hahahaha!
DS63182	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But she promised to contact me again when
things settle down. That's good enough for
now!
DS63183	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63183]	That's good to hear.|That's too bad.
DS63184	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	While talking to her	 I could almost hear the
joy of her muscles through the phone.
DS63185	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Thank you for setting her free!
Now we can finally be healthy! they said...
DS63186	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	She told me too how grateful she was.
She sounded so full of life...
DS63187	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	While this venture didn't lead to romance	 I feel refreshed... Like after a really good workout.
DS63188	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63188Key]	There's something almost
joyful about the way his
muscles are pumping...
DS63189	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hahahaha! It looks like you could hear
them	 too!
DS63190	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Great! I'd expect nothing less from my
friend! Your ear muscles are
getting stronger!
DS63191	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Now that we've saved some lost muscles	
let's get back to training our own today!
DS63192	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	We'll talk to our muscles	 grow them	 and
help them thrive	 like true workout partners!
DS63193	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I'll always be waiting for you here	 friend!
DS63194	Meek-Looking Woman	W-Wait! You promised to transfer me if I got
you one last signature!
DS63195	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ss-like Man	You've gotta be kiddin' me! Whaddaya mean
you lost the contract!?
DS63196	Meek-Looking Woman	I-I must have dropped it somewhere...!
I'm so	 so sorry...!
DS63197	Meek-Looking Woman	Um	 can I help you?
DS63198	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63198]	I have a delivery.|I'm Anderson's friend.
DS63199	Meek-Looking Woman	That's the contract I lost! Th-Thank you
so much for bringing it to me!
DS63200	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ss-like Man	Ugh	 you've wasted so much of my time.
Tch	 I'm goin' home. We're done here.
DS63201	Meek-Looking Woman	Um... Could I talk to you for a second?
DS63202	Meek-Looking Woman	So you know everything	 huh...? Turns out
I was the one being swindled.
DS63203	Meek-Looking Woman	What you brought to me earlier was
Anderson-san's contract.
DS63204	Meek-Looking Woman	But without it	 we could've voided the deal.
Why would he give this back to me?
DS63205	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63205]	He's that kind of guy.|You really don't know?|To save your muscles.
DS63206	Meek-Looking Woman	...You're right. He's been nothing but kind
to me from the first time we spoke.
DS63207	Meek-Looking Woman	But I made him take out an expensive loan and
pushed him to buy things he doesn't need.
DS63208	Meek-Looking Woman	I really thought this would be the last time	
but nothing changed... I feel so stupid.
DS63209	Meek-Looking Woman	To tell the truth	 I was planning to just
trick him normally back in Zoshigaya...
DS63210	Meek-Looking Woman	But I struggle with big men. They scare me.
So I ended up confessing everything instead.
DS63211	Meek-Looking Woman	I didn't do it because I felt guilty or
anything. And that's why I feel so bad
about it now...
DS63212	Meek-Looking Woman	Did he say anything to you after we parted
ways in Zoshigaya?
DS63213	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63213]	He just hoped you'd be healthy.|He said your muscles are honest.
DS63214	Meek-Looking Woman	...I see.
DS63215	Meek-Looking Woman	I've had a pretty unhealthy lifestyle since I
got this job. I haven't had the time to take
care of myself.
DS63216	Meek-Looking Woman	But he was... truly worried about me.
DS63217	Meek-Looking Woman	What am I supposed to do now?
DS63218	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63218]	You should do what feels right.|You already know.
DS63219	Meek-Looking Woman	You're right... I'm sorry for making you
listen to all my silly problems.
DS63220	Meek-Looking Woman	That voice inside me	 the screams from my
muscles... My body was trying to tell me what
to do	 but I couldn't hear any of it.
DS63221	Meek-Looking Woman	But now I understand. And it's all thanks
to Anderson-san.
DS63222	Meek-Looking Woman	I'll do everything in my power to cancel
Anderson-san's contract!
DS63223	Meek-Looking Woman	It should work out if we treat it as a
cooling-off period... And the loan probably
hasn't even been processed yet.
DS63224	Meek-Looking Woman	Ah... But what should I do after that?
My boss will be so angry with me!
DS63225	Meek-Looking Woman	U-Um...! What do you think I should do...?
DS63226	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63226Key]	I gave the woman a lot
of advice	 including what
to do about Anderson...

DS63232	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n with Large Muscles	Hahahaha! I haven't met muscles this
motivated in ages!
DS63233	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n with Large Muscles	Oh	 sorry! Guess I oughta introduce myself
to the muscles' owner too	 huh?
DS63234	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n with Large Muscles	The name's <color=#FF423F>Anderson</color>. I work part-time at
the gym over there.

DS63237	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	That's great! But don't worry	 I'm not tryin'
to recruit you or nothin'.
DS63238	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I stand here every day	 listening to the
muscles of the people walkin' by.
DS63239	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But I can hear your muscles shoutin' louder
than any others! They're screamin' out to
be trained!
DS63240	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Ah	 sorry! I can tell you're still pretty
confused...
DS63241	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Well	 you see	 workin' on my body taught me
how to listen to my muscles.
DS63242	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	My biceps cryin' out for me to "Get that pump!"
My abs beggin' me to "Turn that six-pack to an eight-pack!"
DS63243	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I listened to their pleas and trained my body
every day into the specimen that stands
before you.
DS63244	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	And wouldn't you know! Now I can hear other
people's muscles too!
DS63245	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I think all the work I put in at the gym built up my ear muscles too.
DS63246	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63246Key]	Somehow	 I doubt that...
DS63247	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But! These days I've been hearin' people's muscles less and less.
DS63248	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Everybody's lackin' spirit. And that means	 their muscles are bein' neglected!
DS63249	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But then I heard the mighty voice of powerful muscles screamin' out to be heard...
DS63250	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	They were your muscles! They're beggin' to be expertly trained!
DS63251	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oh right. I haven't even asked you what your
name is yet	 have I?
DS63252	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS63252]	I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.|I'd rather not say...
DS63253	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	{PLAYER_NAME}... That's got a nice ring
to it. I bet "Gains" is your middle name!
DS63254	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Boy	 you're a shy one	 huh? Should I call you
John Doe?
DS63255	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	No need to be so cautious. I just wanna be
friends!
DS63256	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Okay! We're friends now!
DS63257	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	And what do friends do together?

change all over Shinjuku...
DS65013	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But I just haven't been able to get a single
shot I'm satisfied with. To be honest	 I'm
in a bit of a slump.
DS65014	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65014]	You do have high standards.|That's a tough one.
DS65015	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	That's exactly right! I knew that you would
understand.
DS65016	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	After all	 in my opinion	 you yourself are
quite emblematic of "change."
DS65017	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	...Hm. Now that I'm talking to you	 I feel
like I could try taking a few more photos.
DS65018	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I was actually thinking of changing my
approach and getting a few shots of
Shinjuku's nighttime scenery.
DS65019	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Speaking of which	 could I ask you to
come along?
DS65020	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65020]	Why me?|I'm no photographer.
DS65021	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It won't be anything that difficult. I'd just
like someone to bounce ideas off of.

could be a particularly invigorating
experience.
DS65025	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It'll be a nighttime shoot	 of course	 but I
won't make you stay out that late.
DS65026	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Just a tiny little favor	 but I'll make it
worth your while. What do you think?
DS65027	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65027]	Sounds good to me.|I've got nothing better to do.
DS65028	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Thanks! You're really helping me out.
DS65029	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Well then	 I'll meet you here later tonight.
I'll be waiting!
DS65030	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Hey	 I've been waiting for you. Sorry for
taking up your time.
DS65031	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	There were a few locations I had in mind...
DS65032	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Let's head over there right now	 before it
gets too late.
DS65033	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	When you think of Shinjuku at night	 you
definitely have this image of streets
glowing with neon...
DS65034	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's pretty easy to see why	 but	 well...
DS65035	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Actually	 what do you think?
DS65036	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65036]	It seems conventional.|Where's the "change"?
DS65037	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Exactly. I'm trying to portray "change	
and I just don't feel that here.
DS65038,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,Okay, let's go to the next location.
DS65039,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,This place has a much different feeling...
Like we've gone much deeper, into the
true Shinjuku...
DS65040,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,How do you feel about it?
DS65041,Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65041],I've seen this on TV.|It's kind of sleazy.
DS65042,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,That's true... People have probably seen
this all over the media. We'd hardly be the
first to photograph it.

DS65044,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,If I'm shooting Shinjuku, I want to capture
that Shinjuku vibe... But if it's too clich√©,
it's boring.
DS65045,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,When I've been feeling that sense of
change" here	 it's...
DS65046	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	...Yeah	 let's head to the next place.
DS65047	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Now this is the place I really wanted to
come to.
DS65048	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Most people would think of Shinjuku at night
as a city just for adults	 but...
DS65049	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	These days	 a lot of people around my age
come here too. There's all kinds of trendy
places around this area.
DS65050	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	The public transportation has improved a lot
as well. Look	 right over here.

DS65055	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Is that guy over there a student? He doesn't
seem like an adult...
DS65056	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65056]	You're taking a picture of him?|Do you need permission for that?
DS65057	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's fine. His face isn't in the shot.
In fact	 he's facing the complete
opposite direction.
DS65058	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	And I'll check with him after I take the
photos	 just to be sure. If he has any
problem	 I'll just delete them.
DS65059	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	This is such a natural composition right now	
though	 and I don't want to lose
that atmosphere.

DS65064	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Right. In that case...
DS65065	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	How's this? Maybe a monochrome shot would
suit this scene.

DS65067	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I see. In that case...

great.
DS65069	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65069]	Really captures the aura.|Looks good!
DS65070	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Okay	 now that we've figured out our vision	
let's put it all together!
DS65071	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yeah... It's been a while since I've felt
this way taking photos.
DS65072	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's thanks to your input. I really
appreciate it.
DS65073	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Ah	 that's right! I should check with that
guy about the photo I took.
DS65074	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I hope he doesn't get mad at me... If he
does	 I'll just apologize and delete the
data.
DS65075	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Huh? He's gone already...
DS65076	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	That's not good. Now I have no way to get
his permission...
DS65077	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Oh well. Maybe I can just crop the photo
so he's not visible...
DS65078	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's still a pretty good shot without him in
it	 so I'd hate to let it go to waste.
DS65079	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'll edit these photos when I get back home	
and then upload them to my social media.
DS65080	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Thanks for coming out with me today. You
helped me take some great shots.

DS65089	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	About that reward I mentioned... Are you
able to come to Shinjuku right now?

you about.
DS65091	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65091]	That doesn't sound good.|Did something happen?
DS65092	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's a bit too long to explain... I'd rather

DS65094	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65094Key]	I headed to Shinjuku to meet

night	 and it caused a bit of an outrage.
DS65121	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I did crop it so that guy wasn't in the
shot	 but when I went to post it...
DS65122	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I ended up posting the uncropped version
by mistake.
DS65123	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'd been working until morning	 and went to
bed without even realizing what I'd done...
DS65124	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Just a few hours later	 I woke up to a ton
of notifications on my phone.
DS65125	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I guess that guy in the photo I took... is a
fairly popular young idol.
DS65126	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	You can't see his face at all	 but his fans
would recognize him from any angle.
DS65127	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	And now my profile is full of
their comments...
DS65128	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65128]	What did they write?|What were they mad about?
DS65129	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	They were all like	 "Did you ask before you
took this?" and "Don't invade an idol's
privacy!" That sort of thing...
DS65130	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I never meant to upload it	 so I took it down
immediately and apologized in
the comments...
DS65131	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But the internet works too fast. People
already screenshotted it and were spreading
the picture around.
DS65132	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65132]	Was it really that idol?|They could tell from that angle?
DS65133	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I really don't know. But a pretty significant
number of his fans seem to think it is.
DS65134	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So far	 I haven't actually heard anything
from him or his agency...
DS65135	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But still	 this is all because I was too
careless. I really regret it.
DS65136	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	And of course	 I feel bad about causing so
much trouble for you	 too.
DS65137	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65137]	Sounds pretty hectic.|It was a good picture though...
DS65138	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yeah... I don't think there was anything
wrong with taking the picture.
DS65139	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But photographers do need to be responsible.
After all this	 I'm sure I won't forget that.
DS65140	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	This is the age we live in. One photograph
can throw a person's entire life into chaos.
DS65141	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Even so... I realized I do love photography
after all.
DS65142	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I think I've learned some important lessons
from this whole ordeal.
DS65143	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Also... buried among all those comments	
there were a few actual opinions on
the photo.
DS65144	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65144]	What did they say?|What kind of opinions?
DS65145	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	They said it was a good shot	 and I really
captured the feeling of modern Shinjuku...
DS65146	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Regardless of whether he was an idol or not	
they understood why I wanted to take
his photo...
DS65147	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Those few comments gave me a bit of hope.
The things I wanted to say really did
get across.
DS65148	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Sorry	 I went on a bit long there. This
isn't anything you need to worry about.
DS65149	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I just thought I should let you know...
DS65150	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Oh	 almost forgot. Here's the reward I
promised you.
DS65151	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Despite how things turned out	 I hope you'll
come along with me again sometime.
DS65152	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	All right	 see you later.

time	 I'd like to talk face-to-face.
DS65266	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So... Want to meet by that burger shop on
Central Street in Shibuya?
DS65267	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65267]	Okay	 sure.|If I must.
DS65268	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Guess that's settled	 then! I'll head over
that way now too.
DS65269	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Well then	 see you soon.
DS65270	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Sorry for calling you out of the blue. But I

DS65273	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Right	 I'll cut to the chase.
DS65274	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	That other time	 when I uploaded the photo
and caused all that outrage	 it was a real
disaster.
DS65275	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But getting reactions from so many people
did give me some good motivation.
DS65276	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So this time	 I want to create something
that will resonate with people a bit more.

DS65290	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'll come up with some topics	 and interview
people on the street about them.
DS65291	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	We'll record the whole thing on video	 and
take photos at the end.
DS65292	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65292]	Not just photos this time?|We're doing video	 too?
DS65293	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Right	 that's the key point here.
DS65294	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	The motif of a photo can be hard to convey
to people unfamiliar with the medium.
DS65295	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So to compensate for that	 I thought I could
also take a video to discuss what I wanted
to communicate about the motif.
DS65296	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65296]	What will I be doing?|How should I help?
DS65297	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Right. Just like last time	 I'd like you to
act as my advisor...
DS65298	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Or maybe "planner" would be more accurate.
Feel free to be proactive in throwing
out ideas.
DS65299	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Your insight has such a rich sense of
change. More than I could ever imagine
on my own.
DS65300	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So how about it? Want to come help me
out again?
DS65301	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65301]	No problem.|I'll give it a shot...
DS65302	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Good to hear. I'm so glad you're interested.
DS65303	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So	 before this creative inspiration fades	
let's head out and start shooting right away.
DS65304	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65304]	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_content_DS65304]
DS65305	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Once you've finished eating	 let's start
over by Shibuya Crossing.
DS65306	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	So	 before we begin our interviews	 I think
we should decide on our first topic.
DS65307	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	What do you think would be good? Perhaps...
What's your favorite food?
DS65308	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	How's that sound to you?
DS65309	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65309]	It's a bit boring...|That doesn't sound like you.
DS65310	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Good point	 you're exactly right. It doesn't
have that magnificent	 fascinating quality
that I'm after.
DS65311	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	That said	 just what kind of topic would
be best?
DS65312	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65312]	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_content_DS65312]
DS65313	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65313]	We already have it.|What's been your motif all along?
DS65314	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Ah	 that's right... "Change."
DS65315	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	For the sake of the interview	 we could
phrase it as	 "What sort of changes have you
experienced recently?"
DS65316	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yes	 I think that sort of question should
inspire some good responses.
DS65317	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	When we take photos afterward	 the subject
will understand the theme better.
DS65318	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65318]	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_content_DS65318]
DS65319	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Okay. We've decided on our topic	 so let's
begin the interviews.
DS65320	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n in a Suit	An interview? You guys don't exactly look
like a TV crew...

making a video.
DS65324	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n in a Suit	A video...?
DS65325	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n in a Suit	I've heard about things like this. A while
back	 there was some influencer causing
trouble shooting videos in public...
DS65326	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n in a Suit	Are you two planning on making me an
internet laughingstock!?

DS65329	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65329]	That's not our intention.|We're just trying to...
DS65330	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n in a Suit	You two are students	 aren't you? Once you've
entered the workforce	 you won't have time
to mess around like this.
DS65331	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>n in a Suit	Now if you'll excuse me	 I need to get back
to the office.
DS65332	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Shoot... He turned really aggressive
out of nowhere.
DS65333	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65333]	We asked the wrong person.|Some people are just like that.
DS65334	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yeah	 that happens a lot when you're taking
snapshots	 too.
DS65335	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	In fact	 I'd say most people have a negative
response to unsolicited interactions
like that.

DS65338	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But let's not be discouraged. We'll just
shake it off and find the next subject.
DS65339	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y in School Uniform	Huh	 an interview? And... you want it
on video?
DS65340	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y in School Uniform	No way	 no way! Video footage is totally
off-limits!

are you?
DS65342	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65342]	We're not.|No need to worry.
DS65343	Boy in Sc<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ool Uniform	Ah	 that's a relief... I'd be in huge trouble

really interested in that interview anyway.
DS65353	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y in School Uniform	Anyways	 I'm out of here. I didn't cut class
so I could talk to you!
DS65354	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Sorry for bothering you...
DS65355	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Let's not worry about it. That still wasn't
as bad as the first person.
DS65356	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65356]	It can't end like this.|Third time's the charm!
DS65357	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yeah	 that's the spirit. Thanks	 you're a
huge help.
DS65358	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	This time	 let's try to find someone who
looks like they'd really be willing
to talk...
DS65359	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65359]	Maybe an employee?|If we're customers...
DS65360	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Good thinking. A store employee wouldn't be
allowed to be that rude to us...
DS65361	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	There's a cr√™pe shop right around here.
DS65362	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Okay	 let's head over there next.

DS65378	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Businessman	Oh! Actually	 I'd been dating this guy
recently	 but...

DS65381	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Businessman	Well	 I wouldn't say that...
DS65382	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Businessman	I mean	 I was kinda depressed right after
we split...
DS65383	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Businessman	But then	 the cr√™pes from this shop cheered
me right up!
DS65384	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Businessman	They're so delicious and sweet	 they make me
way happier than any guy I've ever met!
DS65385	S<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>spicious Businessman	So that's when I made up my mind. I'm going
to marry these cr√™pes!

that girl at the cr√™pe shop.
DS65390	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65390]	About what I expected.|Let's upload it anyway.
DS65391	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yeah. She did say she was really looking
forward to seeing her video and photo	
at least.
DS65392	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'll go home and edit the video today.
If I hurry	 I should be able to upload
it by tonight.

memorable first step.

DS65401	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'll start with the good news. The interview
video got a fair amount of buzz.
DS65402	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	When I saw all those comment notifications	
I was worried I'd started another outrage.
DS65403	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But the comments had nothing to do with my
motif of "change	 or the photos I took...

DS65408,Rikuto Shi<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>izu,The cr√™pe shop girl is super cute! Forget
the cr√™pes	 marry me instead!"
DS65409	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	She must really love cr√™pes. And she's
great on camera, too.
DS65410	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'm going to check out that shop and see
if I can meet her.
DS65411	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's so unfair you only talked to her!
Come interview our store, too!
DS65412	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's pretty much all like that. That employee
took all the attention.
DS65413	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But unlike last time	 at least it's all
positive reactions.
DS65414	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65414]	You never know what will go viral.|Not bad for your first video.
DS65415	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yeah. I certainly have more motivation to
continue with this project.
DS65416	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	And... I don't think I could've made this
video without your support.
DS65417	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I had high hopes for the positive change you
would bring about	 you see.
DS65418	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	You really are the best partner for me
after all.
DS65419	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS65419]	You can always count on me.|Let's keep doing our best.
DS65420	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Thanks. I'm looking forward to working

I'll be sure to give you a call.
DS65422	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I can't wait to see what we can create
next time.

DS70008	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team Member	No	 no	 I meant it as a compliment.

DS70017	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	There are less than 11 of us now	 so you'll be a regular right from the get-go!

DS70026	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Let's all try to work together	 okay?
DS70027	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Oh	 I almost forgot. Have you ever played before?
DS70028	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70028]	I have.|Never.
DS70029	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I see! Then we can count on you to be a valuable asset to the team!
DS70030	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	It'll be a problem for us if this new guy's just pretending to be some expert.
DS70031	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Really? Well	 I'm sure you've got what it takes. You'll pick it up in no time	 I promise.
DS70032	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	Should we really bring in someone with no experience?
DS70033	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>willing Clubmate	Crap. Now we'll actually have to play games. What a pain.
DS70034	Unmotiv<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ted Clubmate	Kurosawa's so desperate he'll take anyone. That's hilarious.
DS70035	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You guys! Don't be so rude! {NAME1}'s doing us a favor here!
DS70036	Goalkee<#000000	p	#FFFFFF>er	Wait	 Kurosawa.
DS70037	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>alkeeper	You get why they're worried	 right?
DS70038	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Kadota...
DS70039	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>alkeeper	I'm <color=#FF423F>Mamoru Kadota</color>	 a second year. I know
you just joined and all...
DS70040	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	But we won't know what to do with you till we've seen what you're made of.
DS70041	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	So	 mind facing off against me in a round of penalty kicks?
DS70042	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	What are you saying	 Kadota!? Not you too!
DS70043	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	I don't want us wasting anyone's time. Let's just see what he can do already.
DS70044	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70044Key]	All of the other players are
watching... I don't think I
can back down.
DS70045	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	Well	 {NAME1}? Feeling up to the challenge?
DS70046	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70046]	I've got this.|Go easy on me.
DS70047	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	That's the spirit. Just know	 I'm not gonna go easy on you.
DS70048	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	Are you being modest? Or are you for real? Well	 only one way to find out.
DS70049	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>willing Clubmate	This guy has no clue what he's up against	 does he? Kadota was the goalkeeper for the regional league team.
DS70050	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	Heck	 Kurosawa and Kadota are the two pillars propping up the whole team.
DS70051	Unmotiv<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ted Clubmate	Can this guy even get the ball into the net?
DS70052	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Sorry	 {NAME1}! I didn't mean to put so much on your plate so suddenly.
DS70053	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	But could you please play along so we can change their minds?
DS70054	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Kadota may be our guardian angel	 but maybe you have a chance...
DS70055	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It's settled! {NAME1} wins!
DS70056	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	Ngh!? How did you beat me?
DS70057	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>willing Clubmate	Seriously? I can't believe Kadota lost.
DS70058	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	Huh. He's better than I thought.
DS70059	Unmotiv<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ted Clubmate	Well	 if he wants to join that bad	 let him.
DS70060	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Well done	 {NAME1}. I knew you had it in you!
DS70061	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70061]	It was a breeze.|That was close.
DS70062	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Well	 penalty kicks give the kicker an overwhelming advantage	 but...
DS70063	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Still	 that was amazing! Going head-to-head with Kadota like that!
DS70064	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I think the other players seem a bit more motivated after seeing you play.
DS70065	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I hope your presence will be a positive influence on the team.
DS70066	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Oh	 sorry. I forgot to mention	 you made the team just now.
DS70067	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	So	 let me officially welcome you to the Kokatsu Academy Soccer Team.
DS70068	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Happy to have you aboard! Let's aim for the national stadium together!
DS70069	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>willing Clubmate	*huff* *huff* It's finally over.
DS70070	Unmotiv<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ted Clubmate	That was exhausting...
DS70071	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	Let's get out of here. I've got some TV to watch.
DS70072	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70072Key]	The balls are still
scattered around...
DS70073	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70073Key]	And we haven't done
field maintenance.
DS70074	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70074]	Shouldn't we pick up the balls?|Shouldn't we take care of the field?
DS70075	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>willing Clubmate	Huh? If you wanna do it	 go ahead.
DS70076	Unmotiv<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ted Clubmate	We're too tired for that. Catch you later.
DS70077	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Huh? Where did everyone go?
DS70078	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70078Key]	I explained that everyone
bailed on cleanup duty.
DS70079	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Ugh	 not again...
DS70080	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Sorry	 {NAME1}. That's no way for them to treat our newest member.
DS70081	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Remember how I told you a lot of our players lost interest and quit all of a sudden?
DS70082	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It really took a toll on morale for the ones who stuck around.
DS70083	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	They're just barely participating in club activities as it is.
DS70084	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Things like tending to the field and post-practice cleanup fall by the wayside.
DS70085	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	But that's just the way it goes	 so I usually take care of it all myself.
DS70086	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I wanna do something to change the attitude around here.
DS70087	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	That's why I was recruiting players	 trying to make it so we have the minimum needed to play.
DS70088	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Then you came along and agreed to join. Can you imagine how thrilled I was?
DS70089	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I'm definitely going to change things around here	 so just hold out till then	 okay?
DS70090	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Great! Thanks. It's a huge relief having you around.
DS70091	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I know! Why don't we practice a bit before cleaning up?
DS70092	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You're skilled	 but you've only just joined. You're struggling to make team plays	 right?
DS70093	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	That's why I'm thinking we should practice making plays between the two of us first.
DS70094	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	If the other guys see us cooperating	 they'll probably start thinking of doing the same with you.
DS70095	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Basically	 I'm saying we should get some secret training in by ourselves. What do you say?
DS70096	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70096]	Sure.|Let's do it!
DS70097	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70097Key]	I trained in secret
with Kurosawa...
DS70098	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70098Key]	After training	 the two of
us cleaned up together.
DS70099	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	All right! Done cleaning. Thanks for helping out.
DS70100	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Good work today. Ready to head out?
DS70101	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Oh	 you know what!? We should stop for curry on the way home!
DS70102	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70102]	Are you paying?|Why not ramen?
DS70103	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Of course! I know it's a little late	 but we should celebrate you joining the team.
DS70104	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Shimokita is better known for curry. Don't worry! Naan makes a great snack!
DS70105	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	There's a curry shop I visit often. I'll take you there.
DS70106	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	......
DS70107	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70107Key]	I ate curry with Kurosawa

practice today?
DS70111	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70111]	Sure.|Probably not.
DS70112	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Glad to hear it! Let's head straight to the
field	 then!
DS70113	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Oh... Well	 I guess you've got stuff going
on. Let me know if you can join us later!
DS70120	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	We're going to split into two teams and do a scrimmage!
DS70121	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	We don't have enough for full teams	 so it'll be five on five.
DS70122	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	I'll be the referee. That leaves exactly five on each team.
DS70123	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>willing Clubmate	No fair! I wanna sit around and watch as
the ref.
DS70124	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	Sorry	 man. I called it.
DS70125	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Okay	 let's split the remaining members into two even teams.
DS70126	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70126Key]	I ended up on
Kurosawa's team...
DS70127	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	All right. Time to show them all how much our secret training has paid off!
DS70128	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Our teamwork is going to blow everyone out of the water!
DS70129	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	Hey. This looks like it'll be an interesting match.
DS70130	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Kadota	 you're on the other team	 right? Go easy on us	 will you?
DS70131	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	Nah	 not gonna happen.
DS70132	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Huh?
DS70133	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	I'm gonna get revenge for the penalty shootout the other day	 {NAME1}.
DS70134	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	You and Kurosawa aren't going to get a single shot in. That's all I came to say.
DS70135	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Looks like he's starting to see you as a rival.
DS70136	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70136]	Does he hate me?|Today's rival is tomorrow's friend.
DS70137	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	No	 it's a good thing. Kadota's been feeling unmotivated lately	 but...
DS70138	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Exactly! You know	 Kadota's been pretty unmotivated lately	 but...
DS70139	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You must've lit a fire under him!
DS70140	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Now we just need to stoke it!

DS70146	Unki<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>d Clubmate	Foul!
DS70147	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You okay	 {NAME1}? Can you make the kick?
DS70148	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	A one-on-one shootout against Kadota... It's just like the day you joined.
DS70149	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Kadota is more motivated than he was back then...
DS70150	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	But so are you. Show them where all that secret training got you!
DS70151	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	Come at me. I'll stop you for sure this time!
DS70152	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Way to go	 {NAME1}!

DS70160	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Right? That was one fine pass if I do say so myself.
DS70161	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	No way. I'm a striker. If I think I can score	 I'll take the shot without hesitation.
DS70162	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	At the time	 I just thought it was best to pass the ball to you.
DS70163	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	I need to talk to you.

DS70168	Ma<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>oru Kadota	Your kicks awakened something in me. Something I lost sight of lately.
DS70169	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	My passion for soccer. I can feel it starting to come back to me.

DS70232	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Agh!
DS70233	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Whoa! Are you hurt?
DS70234	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Heh	 gotcha!
DS70235	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Dude! Don't scare me like that.
DS70236	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	That was a close one though. I could have been seriously hurt. Be more careful	 all right?
DS70237	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Sorry. I was just chasing the ball and...
DS70238	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It's fine. Don't worry about it. Let's get back to practice.
DS70239	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	......

DS70242	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Let's get back to practice! We have to stay focused!
DS70243	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Haaah	 finally done.
DS70244	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unmotivated Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Everyone's more motivated than ever today.
DS70245	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unkind Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Well	 we wanna beat Nanjo	 right? Gotta keep workin' hard.
DS70246	Inner Thoughts	I don't see Kurosawa
anywhere... Where could he
have gone?
DS70247	Inner Thoughts	I decided to go look for him.
DS70248	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Nngh!
DS70249	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	{NAME1}!?

DS70254	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It's fine! It'll heal if I just stay off it.
DS70255	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You're overreacting! It's not nearly bad enough for that!
DS70256	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Could you keep quiet about this?
DS70257	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Everyone's finally motivated. I don't want to dampen the mood.
DS70258	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Plus	 we don't have bench players. Without me	 we can't play in the scrimmage.
DS70259	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	The last thing I want to do is make everyone anxious.
DS70260	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It'll be fine. There's still a few days until the scrimmage.
DS70261	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I can still come to practice	 and I'm sure it'll heal on its own by the game. So don't worry	 okay?
DS70262	Inner Thoughts	Is he really okay...?
DS70263	Inner Thoughts	I understand how Kurosawa
feels. I guess I'll trust him
for now.
DS70264	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Thanks	 {NAME1}.
DS70265	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I know! Let's get some curry on the way home. Curry and some sleep might just fix me up.
DS70266	Inner Thoughts	A limping Kurosawa and I
visited the curry shop before
heading home...
DS70270	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Today's our scrimmage against Nanjo!
DS70271	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Let's show them what the new Kokatsu Academy Soccer Team can do!
DS70272	S<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ccer Team M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>mbers	Yeeeah!

DS70280	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I'll be fine. I can stick it out till the match is over.
DS70281	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70281]	You should sit this one out.|You sure you're okay?
DS70282	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Not happening. I can't let everyone down. Not you	 not the team	 not Nanjo either.
DS70283	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Honestly	 I might not be. But I have to pull through today.
DS70284	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I'm really grateful for everything you've done.
DS70285	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You know	 I was at my wits' end back when I was recruiting for new members.
DS70286	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	If I couldn't get us a new member	 we would've had to disband.
DS70287	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I think I might've already given up back then.
DS70288	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Then you came along. We struggled side-by-side	 and now our team's back in high spirits.
DS70289	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It's all because of you that we're here now.
DS70290	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	That's why I don't want the momentum you've created for us to stop here!
DS70291	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I'm begging you	 {NAME1}. Could you keep quiet about my leg for just a little longer?
DS70292	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS70292]	I'll score enough for both of us.|Leave everything to me.
DS70293	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Thanks. But I can't just rely on you for every‚Äî
DS70294	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Wait. Hold on a second. That might actually be a good idea.
DS70295	Inner Thoughts	The practice match begins...
DS70296	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Damn it! We're running out of time!
DS70297	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>njo Team's Fo<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ward	They're behind by a point! Let's score some goals and secure the win!
DS70298	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Like we'd let that happen! We need to tie
it up	 guys!
DS70299	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	We're counting on you	 Kurosawa!
DS70300	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Leave it to me!
DS70301	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>njo Team's Def<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>nder	Stop Kurosawa!
DS70302	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>njo Team's Midfiel<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>er	Kokatsu's nothing if we keep him covered!
DS70303	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Ack. Now I have to make the shot from here...
DS70304	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Or so you'd think!
DS70305	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>njo Team's Midfiel<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>er	Hey! Who's that guy!?
DS70306	N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>njo Team's Fo<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ward	I don't know! Was he on the team before!?
DS70307	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	All right! We're tied!
DS70308	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>feree	Game over!
DS70309	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	That was a close one! Looks like my plan worked out.
DS70310	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Nanjo knows us all too well	 so I knew they'd target me.
DS70311	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I took advantage of that‚Äîdrew their attention so you could score!
DS70312	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Ideally	 we would've scored early and then defended the lead to the end...
DS70313	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	But I guess it wasn't going to be that easy. At least we got a tie out of it!
DS70314	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unkind Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Doesn't that mean we're going into overtime!?
DS70315	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	No	 today's just a scrimmage	 so we'll do penalty kicks.
DS70316	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unmotivated Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Well	 this is your time to shine	 Kurosawa. Don't let us down	 ace!
DS70317	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Sorry... My legs are shot. Can't kick a ball straight.
DS70318	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Huh? Did you get hurt!?
DS70319	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	{NAME1} will take the kicks for me.
DS70320	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unmotivated Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	{NAME1}? Well	 yeah	 I guess it has to be him.
DS70321	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unkind Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	We're counting on you	 {NAME1}! Win this for us!
DS70322	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	You've got this. No doubt in my mind.
DS70323	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	That settles it. We're counting on you!
DS70324	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	You did it	 {NAME1}! You're the best!
DS70325	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unmotivated Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	We won! We actually won!
DS70326	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unkind Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Yeeeaaah! We did it! We woooon!
DS70327	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	It might just be a scrimmage	 but it's our first win with this lineup!
DS70328	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Hey	 Kurosawa. You've been hiding an injury	 haven't you?
DS70329	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Wait. Was it from when I bumped into you?
DS70330	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	My bad. It was a light injury	 so I didn't think I needed to bring it up.
DS70331	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	It's all on me for keeping quiet and not letting it heal. Sorry	 guys.
DS70332	On<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>e-Unwilling Club<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ate	Kurosawa...
DS70333	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	But now I'm going to focus on getting better.
DS70334	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	And I promise I'll be back by the time the tournament rolls around.
DS70335	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>moru Kadota	You better be. Until then	 we'll train and get even stronger.
DS70336	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	Great. Our next goal is to play in the tournament and get through the first round!
DS70337	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	We'll be counting on you	 {NAME1}!
DS70338	Inner Thoughts	I shared the joy of our first
victory with everyone on

DS71157	H<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>roto	Mama	 your hand	 does it hurt?
DS71158	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	Your hand?
DS71159	H<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>roto's Mother	Oh	 this? It's nothing. Just a papercut I got handling paperwork at the office.
DS71160	H<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>roto's Mother	Since it's so small	 I just ignored it	 but it does actually sting a bit.
DS71161	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	The cut might be deeper than you think. Why don't I give you something to cover it with?

DS71166	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	Oh	 right	 if the pain from the cut gets more severe	 go see a doctor right away!

DS71182	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Hey	 Minami! Have the kids gone home?
DS71183	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Huh? Oh	 {NAME2}-kun! What's up? You helping Minami out again?
DS71184	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	No! He just came by a while ago. We were just chatting.
DS71185	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Haha. Sure	 whatever you say. So what were you talking about?

DS71187	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71187Key]	I told Minami's dad we were

DS71188	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	*sigh*
DS71189	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	That so? And what'd she tell you?
DS71190	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	Er	 well... It wasn't about dreams for the future so much as...
DS71191	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Whenever I ask her	 all she says is that she's gonna graduate and work at the shop.
DS71192	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	There's something you're not telling me...
DS71193	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	So there IS something you really want to do.
DS71194	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Minami... I'm always saying it	 aren't I?
Once you're out of high school	 chase
your dreams!
DS71195	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	I meant what I said!
DS71196	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	Like I'm always telling you	 my future goal is to work here!
DS71197	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	But that's not what you really want to do	 it's what you think you have to do! Am I wrong?
DS71198	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	Yes	 you are! I never said I wanted anything else	 even at career guidance at school!
DS71199	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	And I've always told you not to worry about the shop	 because I can hire a part-timer!
DS71200	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	I don't need you to help me here. You don't need to force yourself!
DS71201	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	How many times do I have to tell you I'm not forcing myself	 you idiot!
DS71202	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	I'll be in the shop!
DS71203	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Ah! Hey	 Minami!
DS71204	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	*sigh*... Ow...
DS71205	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Apologies... Don't worry about it	 I'm fine...
DS71206	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Sorry you had to see all that. I shouldn't've gotten you involved.
DS71207	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Y'know	 when she was little	 she couldn't stop talking about how she wanted to become a nurse.
DS71208	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	But right before she started elementary school	 her mom passed from an illness.
DS71209	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	I think seein' me so broken up back then gave her this habit of worrying about me so badly.
DS71210	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	So I'd try to show her I was doing fine by throwing it all into work...
DS71211	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	And I guess I worked too hard	 since I ended up bustin' my back.
DS71212	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Ever since that	 all I hear from her is	 "I wanna help you at the shop!"
DS71213	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Even though all I want for her is to be free and follow her dreams	 y'know.
DS71214	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Ah	 what am I doin' makin' you sit here and listen to our family problems.
DS71215	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Hey {NAME2}-kun. Can I ask you to keep hanging out with Minami	 for me?
DS71216	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	It sounds like she can talk about things with you she can't say to me.
DS71217	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nami's Father	Thanks.

DS71235	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	Hey	 are you free now?
DS71236	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	I'm kinda thirsty	 so I'm gonna grab a lemonade. Why don't you have one with me?

DS71240	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	I do feel like I can say things I usually wouldn't when I'm talking to you	 too.
DS71241	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	It's not that I feel like I need to be here to support Dad.
DS71242	Min<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mi Miyashita	It's just something I want to do. I'm not lying when I say that.

DS71504,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I'm glad you decided to come along. Wouldn't want you leaving in a bad mood, right?
DS71505,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You know what they say about us old ladies, always meddling in people's business.
DS71506,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Come on, I'll walk you to the station.
DS71507,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Feel free to reach out again if you ever feel like it, {NAME1}-kun.
DS71508,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,AAAAAA==
DS71509,Inner Thoughts,Chizuko appears to
be sleeping...
DS71510,Inner Thoughts,I should wake her up...
DS71511,Inner Thoughts,I've been meeting up with
Chizuko at this jazz club a
few times now, but...
DS71512,Inner Thoughts,She seems even drunker than
usual today...
DS71513,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Hm?
DS71514,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Oh... You came, {NAME1}-kun. Sorry, looks like I dozed off.
DS71515,Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71515],Are you tired?|Did something happen?
DS71516,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,...You've got a real keen eye. Seems like I can't hide anything from you.
DS71517,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Well... So like I told you before, I've got this grandchild.
DS71518,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,The two of us live together, but... Well, it's complicated.
DS71519,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,We're not on bad terms. I just don't know how to deal with someone like her.
DS71520,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Just today, I mighta said somethin' I shouldn't have. Maybe I open my mouth too much.
DS71521,Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71521],You know how young people are.|You shouldn't be too nosy.|Aren't you worrying too much?
DS71522,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Agh... Yeah, you're right. I can't help but worry, though.
DS71523,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,This grandchild of mine, you see... recently attempted suicide...
DS71524,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,It was just so sudden... Someone who seemed so happy around me jumping like that...
DS71525,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I couldn't believe it when I got the hospital call. Critical condition and unconscious.
DS71526,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,She's awake again, but... Walking is going to take her a while, they say...
DS71527,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Sure, I'm glad the worst didn't happen... But what I really want is for her to be happy.
DS71528,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,So, when I think about something happening
again because I said the wrong thing...
DS71529,Chizuko N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gao,I thought I knew it all full well, but today I...
DS71530,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I just hate myself. I either do the wrong thing or I do nothing at all...
DS71531,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I despise myself for being this way. It's the reason I keep escaping to this hole at night like this.
DS71532,Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71532],I didn't know about all that.|You shouldn't drink too much.
DS71533,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Heh... And now I'm even dragging a youngster like you into this. I really am an awful old lady.
DS71534,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,But hey, I should count myself lucky in a way. I know that other people have it a whole lot worse than I do.
DS71535,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,My granddaughter... Manaka. I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through.
DS71536,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,......
DS71537,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Tell me, {NAME1}-kun. I don't mean to burden you with all this but...
DS71538,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,As someone the same age as her, could you give this old lady some advice?
DS71539,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,What should I do to cheer her up?
DS71540,Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71540],Just help her relax.|What is she into?|Got any common interests?
DS71541,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Let her relax, eh... How could I do that...
Ah, I could play her some music?
DS71542,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,What Manaka likes...
DS71543,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,She loves music. Especially singing.
DS71544,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You say that, but we're two generations apart...
DS71545,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Oh, that's it!
DS71546,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,She loves music, just like me.
DS71547,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Back when she was feeling well, we would
come to this jazz bar together.
DS71548,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Manaka always seemed to enjoy herself here so much. Yes, maybe coming here would do her some good.
DS71549,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Oh, but bringing here to a crowded place all of a sudden could be too much...
DS71550,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,......
DS71551,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Ah... I did see a poster on the wall that
says Recruiting for Open Mic"...
DS71552	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71552]	Are you going to perform?|Another memory?
DS71553	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	One time we talked about performing together. Me on the sax... and Manaka on vocals.
DS71554	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71554]	You know how to play?|Sounds cool!|I'd love to watch you.
DS71555	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I sure can. My late husband loved music. I tried all kinds of instruments myself.
DS71556	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	You think so? Heh	 now I want you to watch
me play sometime.
DS71557	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I get it... I wanted to see her standing on the stage one day too.
DS71558	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Getting her there may be tough	 but that
doesn't mean it's impossible.
DS71559	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Thank you	 {NAME1}-kun. You helped me remember a lot of things I'd forgotten.
DS71560	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Seems like I had convinced myself there was only so much I could do for her.
DS71561	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I'm getting on in years	 my left eye can't see so good anymore	 I've got a bad back...
DS71562	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	But saying I can't do anything because of that was nothing more than an excuse.
DS71563	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I know you can do it.|Let's both give it our best.
DS71564	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	You know what? I think I will! Nothing more pathetic than giving up before you even try!
DS71565	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	But	 well... I am a little worried if it'll go well or not. If the timing works out...
DS71566	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Do you think you could be there too	 {NAME1}-kun...?
DS71567	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS71567]	Absolutely.|You'd want me there?|Should I jam along?
DS71568	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Thank you. You alone would be all the support I need.
DS71569	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Of course you. Besides... I don't know if I can talk to her right if it's just the two of us.
DS71570	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I'll handle that part. My grandchild wouldn't get the message unless it's from me.
DS71571	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	*sigh* Looks like I've been a huge coward all this time. I failed to notice the glaringly obvious.
DS71572	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	But now that I've made up my mind	 I'm gonna give this everything I have.
DS71573	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I might end up making a big fool of myself	 but... I'm counting on you	 {NAME1}-kun.
DS71578	Inner Thoughts	I should go look
for Chizuko...
DS71574	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	I'll contact you again once I have a date.
DS71575	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Make it home safe	 okay?
DS71576	Inner Thoughts	I parted ways with Chizuko
at the station...

DS81202	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81202]	Of course!|I heart Shibuya!
DS81203	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Good answer! I can tell you're a true
Shibuya believer.
DS81204	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Now then	 looks like it's time for...
DS81205	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Shichi-kun's surprise Shibuya Quiz!
DS81206	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Get it right	 and you'll win a special prize
from me	 Shichi-kun!
DS81207	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81207]	I accept your challenge!|I'll get that prize!
DS81208	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Naturally	 this quiz is all about our lovely
city of Shibuya!
DS81209	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	For a true lover of Shibuya such as yourself	
this should be a cinch!
DS81210	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Ready?
DS81211	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81211]	Bring it!|All set!
DS81212	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Right then	 question one! Our first category
is "local shopping"!
DS81213	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	There's a ton of stores in the underground
mall. You can find all sorts of amazing
things for sale there!
DS81214	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Now	 suppose your friend from abroad is
visiting and you want to get them the perfect
gift that just screams "Japan"...
DS81215	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Which store are you gonna head to?
DS81216	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81216]	The flower shop.|The souvenir shop.|The cosmetic store.
DS81217	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Oooh	 sorry	 that's wrong!
DS81218	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Maybe you should take a closer look next
time you visit the underground mall.
DS81219	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	But	 that's just the first question out
of three!
DS81220	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Don't lose hope now!
DS81221	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	That's exactly right! I can feel the
Shibuya love!
DS81222	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Second question is coming in hot	 so let's
keep it up!
DS81223	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Show me your true passion for Shibuya!
DS81224	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81224]	You got it!|I heart Shibuya!
DS81225	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Question two! This time we're headed over
to Central Street!
DS81226	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Shopping in Central Street is so much fun	
but there's almost too many delicious things
to eat!
DS81227	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Now tell me	 do you know the name of the
burger restaurant on Central Street?
DS81228	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81228]	Bye-Bye Burger|Boom Bang Burger|Big Dog Burger
DS81229	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Ah	 too bad! That's incorrect.
DS81230	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	But sometimes even I forget the name of a
restaurant as soon as I walk through the door!
DS81231	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	You've still got the third question left to
go	 so don't let it get you down!
DS81232	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	That's exactly right! I can feel the
Shibuya love!
DS81233	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Hehe	 that brings us to our third question!
DS81234	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Last one! You've got this!
DS81235	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81235]	Leave it to me!|Howdy-hey!
DS81236	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Question three! This time	 we're looking at
the Station Square!
DS81237	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	The square in front of Shibuya Station is a
pretty famous meeting spot	 you know?
DS81238	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	You've probably made plans to meet your pals
here too a few times	 I'm sure...
DS81239	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	So... When you're meeting people at Station
Square	 what kind of animal is the statue
right in the center?
DS81240	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81240]	A dog.|A cat.|A monkey.
DS81241	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	That's exactly right! I can feel the
Shibuya love!
DS81242	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Whoops	 too bad. That's not right. Maybe
you're just more of a cat person?
DS81243	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Next time you're at the Station Square	
take a closer look!
DS81244	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Too bad	 that's incorrect!
DS81245	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	But	 if we did have a monkey here in front
of Shibuya Station...
DS81246	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	That would be pretty fun	 huh?
DS81247	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Okay	 that's all of my questions! You did
a great job!
DS81248	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	And your final score is... 100%! You've got
some serious Shibuya love	 I can tell.
DS81249	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	I could tell you're a true Shibuya devotee!
I'm so happy... *sniff* It brings a tear
to my eye...
DS81250	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81250]	I'm happy too.|Let's see a smile.
DS81251	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Seeing someone who loves Shibuya just as
much as I do... Ah	 this is what I live for!
DS81252	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Alright	 for getting every single question
right	 you've earned a reward! Here	 you
deserve this!
DS81253	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	I hope you'll continue to spread the love
for Shibuya!
DS81254	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Until next time	 then! Howdy-hey!
DS81255	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Maybe the questions were a bit too hard?
DS81256	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	But don't feel bad! I've still got prizes
waiting for you.
DS81257	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Come back next time and aim for the top!
DS81258	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS81258]	I'll get it next time!|I must hone my love for Shibuya...
DS81259	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Yeah	 yeah	 that's the spirit! We've gotta
love Shibuya more and more!
DS81260	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ichi-kun	Until then	 howdy-hey!

fortune!
DS600070	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	Manifest	 O divine power!
DS600071	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	Yes	 I've seen everything.
DS600072	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	The overflowing desires... The light of
the moon... The piercing brilliance...
DS600073	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	Yes	 I've seen it! Today	 you...
You have very good luck!
DS600074	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	I'm sure good things will happen to you
no matter what you do today.
DS600075	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	Heh heh! Well	 look at that.
DS600076	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	My goodness... What an interesting result.
It seems that many unexpected things could
happen to you today.
DS600077	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	Maybe you ought to head home and go
to sleep tonight.
DS600078	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	How was your destiny-blazing
fortune reading?
DS600079	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ihaya Mifune	Be sure to come and see me if you ever
want your fortune read again!
DS610001	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Oh dear	 this won't do... What ever should
I do?
DS610002	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I have something to ask you. It's nothing
terribly important...
DS610003	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610003]	Sure.|Now's not a good time...
DS610004	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	There's a sweets shop not far from here.
I heard they've started selling a new
dessert.
DS610005	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I saw the dessert featured on a television
program. It seems it's only available for a
limited amount of time.
DS610006	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I feel I must try it at least once. I'm
happy to have made it to the shop without
issue but...
DS610007	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	There's a long line of people waiting	 and
they're all so young.
DS610008	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	It's hard not to feel out of place eating
here as a little old lady all by myself.
DS610009	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I tried reaching out to my friends	 but
no one was free to meet today.
DS610010	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	But now that you're here	 {NAME1}-san	
I can go in with confidence.
DS610011	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Would you mind accompanying me to the caf√©?
DS610012	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Oh	 thank goodness. I'm so glad.
DS610013	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	{NAME1}-san	 order whatever you'd like.
It's on me.
DS610014	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610014Key]	I had tea with Fumiyo. She
treated me to the shop's
newest dessert.
DS610015	Employee	Thank you very much!
DS610016	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Oh my	 that was delectable.
DS610017	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I'm a picky eater	 but I love cakes
and pastries...
DS610018	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Oh dear	 have I told you this already?
DS610019	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	At my age	 you start to forget everything.
I hate it. It's very embarrassing.
DS610020	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Thank you for joining me today.
DS610021	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I'm so happy I got to try their new dessert.
DS610022	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	And to think I'd get to enjoy it with such a
handsome young man.
DS610023	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	When did I become so fortunate? I suppose
the longer you live	 the more your
luck improves.
DS610024	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Hehe. I'm sorry for making you accompany
an old lady like me.
DS610025	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I would love to go to a sweets shop with you
again some time.
DS610026	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	There are still many more delicious dessert
shops in this area.
DS610027	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I look forward to the next time.
DS610028	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Today was such fun. I'll have to brag about
it to my friends.
DS610029	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Take care	 dear.
DS610040	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	What a coincidence meeting you here. I'm on
my way to the bookstore.
DS610041	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	No	 there isn't a particular book I'm
looking for. I'm just passing the time.
DS610042	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	You can find just about anything in
Shinjuku's bookstore. I always find myself
going there.
DS610043	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Are you headed somewhere too	
{NAME1}-san?
DS610044	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610044]	I'm also going to the bookstore.|I'm headed somewhere else.
DS610045	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Do you need reference books for school?
Or perhaps you're looking for comic books
and novels?
DS610046	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Oh	 I have an idea. Would you like to
accompany me to the bookstore?
DS610047	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I'm very curious what young people are
reading these days.
DS610048	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Wonderful! Let's head over.
DS610049	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Finding a good book is like meeting a
special new friend.
DS610050	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I wonder what kind of plants we'll run into
today. I can't wait!
DS610051	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610051Key]	Fumiyo and I chatted while
browsing the books together.
DS610052	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	That was fun. Thank you for coming with me.
DS610053	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610053Key]	Fumiyo bought something from
the academic section.
DS610054	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610054Key]	It looks pretty complicated...
DS610055	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Ah	 are you curious about this book?
DS610056	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	An interesting piece of text caught my eye
while flipping through the pages.
DS610057	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	The wording was very profound. I want to
use some of it in my next exhibition.
DS610058	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I think I'd like to use it for my
calligraphy classes as well.
DS610059	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	The subject matter is very complex	 so I
can't soak it all in in one day	 but...
DS610060	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	If I read a little every day and think over
the meaning	 I'll finish it sooner or later.
DS610061	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	No matter how old you get	 you can always
learn something new.
DS610062	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	A day of study, treasured for millennia
A century of wealth, squandered in a morning
DS610063	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	A book is a blessing, worth more than jewels
The wisdom of a word, more precious than gold
DS610064	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	That's a poem I adore. It means what you
gain from study and books is
incredibly valuable.
DS610065	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	But listen to me preaching to the choir. As
a full-time student you must know that better
than anyone.
DS610066	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	AAAAAA==
DS610067	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Coming from someone at my age	 it's hard to
keep advice from sounding preachy.
DS610068	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Perhaps older people try to impart wisdom to
reclaim the time they lost making mistakes
by giving it back to others.
DS610069	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I hope you don't mind my ramblings.
DS610070	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I'm grateful you've been so kind as to lend
an ear	 {NAME1}-san.
DS610071	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Today has been lovely Thank you for such a
wonderful time.
DS610072	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I hope to see you again when you have the
time. Until then	 take care.
DS610080	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I was in the middle of my walk	 but I'm
just about to take a short break.
DS610081	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Are you free now	 {NAME1}-san?
DS610082	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610082]	I'm free.|I have errands to attend to.
DS610083	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Oh really? Is that so?
DS610084	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Walking through a vibrant city like this
always makes me feel energized.
DS610085	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	But compared to other people	 I'm a bit of
a slow walker.
DS610086	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I walk on the edge of the road like this to
avoid blocking people that are in a rush.
DS610087	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	It can be fun just standing here like this.
You see a lot of interesting things.
DS610088	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Sometimes when I stop to catch my breath I
end up overhearing young people's
conversations.
DS610089	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I can't hear most of what they say	 but I'm
sure I've heard them use slang words.
DS610090	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	The slang young people use today... I can't
make heads or tails of it...
DS610091	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	At some point I started becoming very
interested in trying to figure out their
meaning by listening to conversations.
DS610092	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I can't say it's the most dignified hobby.
DS610093	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	And it's not as if I can stop someone in the
street to ask what they mean.
DS610094	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	But it's a way to pass the time.
DS610095	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Ah	 but	 {NAME1}-san	 you must
know their meaning.
DS610096	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Could you help me decipher some of
these words?
DS610097	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610097]	Of course.|I'm not sure I know them all.
DS610098	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Wonderful! Thank you so much.
DS610099	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Don't be silly. This isn't a quiz show.
DS610100	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	If you don't know the meaning of certain
words either	 that's also helpful information
for me.
DS610101	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	The people who passed by just before used
phrases like this...
DS610102	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610102Key]	Fumiyo asked about the slang
words she wants to know.
DS610103	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS610103Key]	I explained the ones I know
as simply as I could.
DS610104	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Ahhh... So that's what it means.
DS610105	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	I knew it'd be best to have a young man like
you teach me the words of your generation.
DS610106	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	To become good at something	 you must throw
away your ego and willingly learn
from others.
DS610107	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Hehehe. I should try to use the slang you
taught me next time.
DS610108	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Well	 I feel all rested up from my walk	 so
I should be heading home.
DS610109	Fumiyo Tosa<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ayashi	Thank you for letting me talk your ear off.
Goodbye	 dear.

lost my staff ID card...

more photos?
DS611001	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	The scenery looks all different.
Maybe it's because you're here...
DS611002	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	*sigh*
DS611003	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS611003]	Is something wrong?|Sighing is a bad habit.
DS611004	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Is something wrong? Absolutely something
is wrong.
DS611005	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	It's another change... An unwelcome one at
that. Everyone's completely losing it.
DS611006	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Yes	 it drives joy away and so on. Though if
that were true	 I'd love to capture it
on film.
DS611007	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Perhaps I'll get the chance if I keep sighing
while carrying this camera around...
DS611008	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I heard there might've been
another Menace-related incident.
DS611009	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	A blanket of gloom has fallen over the city
streets as a result.

DS611011	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Indeed. Ever since people started talking
about these incidents	 the town has gotten
stranger and stranger.

of daily life...

DS611014	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	As you know	 I love change	 but only the kind
that's magnificent and exquisite.
DS611015	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	If you look closely, even a dull, monochrome
routine is brimming with vibrant,
colorful change.
DS611016	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	That is my guiding belief.
DS611017	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But I don't want things to change for
the worse.
DS611018	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS611018]	I don't want that either.|So life should be more colorful?
DS611019	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I'm glad I have someone on my side.
DS611020	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I wonder how many people out there feel
the same...
DS611021	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Of course. If it's possible	 that is...
DS611022	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	At the very least	 I want this camera
to capture things that are bright.
DS611023	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Maybe I'm a little young to be saying this	
but the world's become such an awful place.
DS611024	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	But you managed to create a new change
within it. A hopeful one.
DS611025	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Seeing you has given me hope	 in a way.
I'm very lucky to have met you	 {NAME1}.
DS611026	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS611026Key]	Shimizu looks happy...
DS611027	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Anyway	 sorry for being a downer. Let's get
back to the photos.
DS611028	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS611028]	Want me to strike a pose?|Are you okay to keep going?
DS611029	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	Okay	 give me the most intense pose
you've got.
DS611030	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	No	 wait	 maybe... Maybe a more natural pose
would be a nice change?
DS611031	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I haven't hit my change quota for the day	
and I'm starving for a good one right now.
DS611032	Rikuto Shi<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>izu	I get the feeling there's a change awaiting
me near the station... You'll come with
me	 right?

Mr. Muscle Weekly.

muscles big and beautiful	 huh?

as a purrin' kitten.

pumpin' today?
DS612007	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Ah	 what do we have here?
A new training method!
DS612008	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	My muscles are tremblin'.
They're screamin' for that pump!
DS612009	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Coconut Kato is my hero.
He's the best bodybuilder out there!
DS612010	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	His essays are chock full of training tips	
but he also talks about his daily routine.
DS612011	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I love when he writes about his cheat day
meals. Just readin' it makes me drool!
DS612012	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I even promised myself I'd eat the same meals
on my cheat days!
DS612013	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Wonder what he's got to say this week.
Can't wait to find out!
DS612014	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	You must be quite the connoisseur to wanna
read this first! I'm impressed.
DS612015	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I'm lookin' forward to it too. I wonder
how much weight the hero's gonna bench
this week!
DS612016	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Can't forget to mention his rival too!
DS612017	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	The arm-wrestling contest story is a total
classic. I still have that issue at home.
DS612018	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Well	 let's see what they're up to this week.
My hands are sweatin' just turnin' the page!

awesome info.
DS612021	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	How 'bout it	 friend?
Wanna put it to the test?
DS612022	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Let's go to the gym and see
if we can't get some serious gains!
DS612023	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Okay! Let's get a move on! The training
machines are callin' our names!

Hankerin' for some yakitori?
DS612026	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612026]	Sure am.|No thanks.
DS612027	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	You got it!
DS612028	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	This here's our skewer of the day.
Go on	 give it a try.
DS612029	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	So? What'd you think?
DS612030	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612030]	It's tasty.|The flavor's unique.
DS612031	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	That's real kind of you!
DS612032	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Any yakitori man worth his salt cares about
ingredients. In fact	 I tweak our salt
and tare seasonings daily.
DS612033	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Just little adjustments	 based on
the weather	 temperature	 and humidity.
DS612034	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I put a lot a thought into every kebab.
All to hear customers like you say
it's tasty!
DS612035	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	You noticed? Very impressive	 {NAME2}!
DS612036	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I adjust the seasoning each day based on
the weather and temperature outside.
DS612037	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	That means the flavor of our food
changes on the daily.
DS612038	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	What we humans think is tasty changes
dependin' on how the day's goin'.
DS612039	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	So this is my way of makin' our yakitori
extra special.
DS612040	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	Not the only way though. I've got a few
tricks when it comes to grillin' too.
DS612041	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	I've even got my regular's preferences down.
For example	 Yama-san over there
likes it crispy!
DS612042	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	All that to say	 the yakitori each of
my customers eat...
DS612043	T<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nzo	...is different in its own special way!
But that's not all...
DS612044	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612044Key]	Tanzo looks so happy when he
talks about yakitori...
DS612045	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612045Key]	I ended up talking with him

DS612050	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey	 friend! Perfect timing!
DS612051	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I just ran out of protein.
DS612052	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Was thinkin' I'd go buy some more.
Wanna come with?
DS612053	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	So there's lots of different kinds of
protein. Which one are you feelin' today?
DS612054	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612054]	The classic powder kind.|The easy-to-drink jelly kind.|The stomach-satisfying bar kind.
DS612055	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Right on! There's lots of flavors	 and it's
easy to get all the nutrients you need.
DS612056	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Do you like yours with water	 or with milk?
DS612057	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Water has its advantages	 bein' zero cal
and easy to access on the go.
DS612058	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	On the other hand	 milk helps you fill up
on calcium and other essential vitamins.
DS612059	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Both have their positives	 so it's best
to choose based on the situation.
DS612060	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I personally recommend unsweetened soy milk.
Give it a try sometime!
DS612061	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Great choice! Unlike powder	 you can carry
it around and drink it anywhere.
DS612062	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	It goes down easy even if you're not hungry
or feelin' sick. Always good to have some
on hand.
DS612063	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Personally	 I love that there're so many
flavors. Makes it hard to get tired of.
DS612064	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Meals fit for serious sculptors like us
tend to be lacking in flavor	 you know?
DS612065	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Sometimes they go on sale at the drugstore	
so I try to stock up then.
DS612066	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I know! Why don't we exchange protein jelly
recommendations next time?
DS612067	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Very nice! You know when you're serious
about gains like we are	 it comes with a lot
of dietary restrictions.
DS612068	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But when I find myself battling hunger	
protein bars are there to save the day!
DS612069	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	There're several types of bars
to choose from too.
DS612070	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Personally	 I prefer the crunchy ones!
I find the texture very satisfying.
DS612071	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But the wafer ones are good too.
Perfect when you're only a little hungry.
DS612072	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	So which do you prefer?
I'd love to hear your thoughts!
DS612073	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612073Key]	Anderson and I spoke at
length about protein...
DS612074	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Oops	 got a little carried away there.
Sorry 'bout that.
DS612075	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Let's get our shoppin' done before the store
closes! The proteins are waitin' for us!
DS612076	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_showName_DS612076Key]	Anderson and I went shopping
for protein.
DS612140	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Hey	 friend! Perfect timing!
DS612141	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Guess what? I made
lunch today!
DS612142	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	And of course there's enough for you too!
Wanna eat together?
DS612143	Choices	Eat|Decline
DS612144	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	That's the spirit	 friend!
DS612145	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Aw	 too bad! Next time then!
DS612146	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I woke up at 5 this mornin' so I could make
a perfect meal for you to try.
DS612147	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	The secret to a muscle-buildin' menu is
careful preparation and precise portioning.
DS612148	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Well	 go on! Have a bite of whatever
you like.
DS612149	Inner Thoughts	Anderson's lunch box... There's only three
things to choose from.
DS612150	Choices	I'll have the chicken breast.|I'll have the broccoli.|I'll have the white stuff.
DS612151	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Right on! Everyone loves chicken breast.
Definitely the best place to start.
DS612152	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Naturally	 I removed the skin to reduce
the fat content.
DS612153	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	But it's kind of bland if you just boil it
in salt	 right?
DS612154	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	So this time I added pickled plum and shiso.
Gotta keep the taste interesting so you
don't get tired of it	 you know?
DS612155	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	And it's important not to overcook it so the
meat doesn't dry out!
DS612156	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Startin' with veggies is the way to go!
You really know what you're doin'.
DS612157	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Broccoli is rich in vitamins	 and a great
source of protein. It's definitely my
veggie of choice!
DS612158	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Unfortunately	 it loses a lot of its
nutrients when you boil it.
DS612159	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I recommend steamin' it instead. That way
the nutrients can't escape.
DS612160	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	You can grill it too	 but it's tough to
control the precise amount of heat	 so you
have to be careful!
DS612161	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Good eye! That's an egg white omelette.
DS612162	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	The focus here is protein and potassium.
These pure egg whites are bound to turn in
to pure muscle.
DS612163	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I put my own twist on it with baby sardines.
The saltiness adds a nice flavor.
DS612164	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Sure with the white eggs and the white fish
it looks a bit... white. But you know	
it's more uniform that way!
DS612165	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	And the texture's surprisingly close to a
regular omelette. Go on	 give it a try!
DS612166	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	Well? What'd you think?
DS612167	Ander<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>on	I'll cook it again if you want. I hope
you'll eat your fill when I do!
DS612168	Protagonist's Thoughts	I thoroughly enjoyed
Anderson's home-cooked lunch.
DS612100	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	{NAME1}-kun. You're here!
DS612101	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	And you're holding the bass
perfectly already.
DS612102	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	All right	 let's jam. Don't worry	
I'll give you cues.
DS612103	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Good job. Let's stop here for today.
DS612104	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	It's best to ease into practicing
as a beginner.
DS612105	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Our club motto is "have fun
and take it easy	 after all.
DS612106,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,You're here again, {NAME1}-kun!
You're pretty dedicated, huh?
DS612107,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Your bass skills are improving
significantly too. Can't let myself
fall behind!
DS612108,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,All right, let's jam!
DS612109,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Great work! We finished everything
I had planned for rehearsal today,
so let's wrap up.
DS612110,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,You're keeping up well, {NAME1}-kun.
I think you have a talent for music.
DS612111,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I'm so glad you joined our club, {NAME1}-kun!
See you next practice.
DS612112,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Are you ready, {NAME2}-kun?
DS612113,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Tsurumi and Taiko are rearing to go!
I am too, of course.
DS612114,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,All right, we're all set. Let's hit it!
DS612115,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Great work. Let's wrap up for today.
That was kind of tiring.
DS612116,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Oh, by the way...
DS612117,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Mr. Higashino said he'd leave out some
snacks for when we want to take a breather.
DS612118,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,All right, let's eat some sweets
and charge up for tomorrow!
DS612119,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Hey, {NAME2}-kun. Thanks for
coming today.
DS612120,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I can't believe we finally get to perform
in a competition.
DS612121,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I hope we place well. On that note, let's
start practice!
DS612122,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Good work, {NAME2}-kun.
How's it going on bass?
DS612123,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,If you have any questions about the sheet
music, feel free to ask me.
DS612124,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Oh, school's almost over. Wanna head to the
station together?
DS612125,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,{NAME2}-kun! Glad you're here!
Think that makes everyone, right?
DS612126,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,The competition is soon, so we're all
pretty fired up!
DS612127,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,I'm so excited. I feel like today's gonna be
our best rehearsal yet!
DS612128,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Good job, {NAME2}-kun. That was so fun!
DS612129,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Are you free after this? We were talking
about grabbing dinner before heading home.
DS612130,R<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi,Want to come with us, {NAME2}-kun?
Tsurumi says she knows a really good spot!
DS612200,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Hey, {NAME1}-kun! Fancy meetin' you here.
DS612201,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I'm on my way back from a run.
And I didn't get lost this time!
DS612202,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Are you free right now?
Wanna shoot the breeze for a bit?
DS612203,Choices,I'm free.|Not now.
DS612204,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Great! Then let's hang out for a bit.
DS612205,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Oh, that's too bad. Later then!
DS612206,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The park nearby is one of
my favorite places to run.
DS612207,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Doing laps there really lets you
appreciate the changing seasons.
DS612208,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Like, in spring the ground is covered
in cherry blossom petals and gets all
slippery.
DS612209,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,It can be dangerous running on those,
you know! But the added challenge
motivates me.
DS612210,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The temperature changes every day too,
so you have to think about how best
to pace yourself.
DS612211,Choices,What about summer?|What about fall?|What about winter?
DS612212,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Summer's a battle against the heat!
It's really dangerous if you don't hydrate.
DS612213,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I carry a drink, obviously, but it's still
nice to know there are water fountains
nearby just in case.
DS612214,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I'd also recommend a park with lots of trees.
DS612215,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The risk of getting heatstroke is lower
when you've got shade.
DS612216,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The fallen leaves really alter the condition
of the ground. They're fun to step on though.
DS612217,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,But you'd better be careful of parks
with ginkgo trees!
DS612218,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The fallen nuts have a really strong smell.
If you slip and fall on them, it's pretty
bad.
DS612219,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I fell on a bunch once... The smell got
all over me. I couldn't bear taking
the train like that.
DS612220,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Winter's my personal favorite!
The more you run the warmer you feel.
It's pretty nice!
DS612221,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,But the real hard part about winter
is the wind. Cold wind really drains
your energy.
DS612222,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,The cold wind and sweating combined
can make your body get dangerously cold.
DS612223,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,So if you go for a run in winter, you'll want
to pick a park with evergreens to block
the wind!
DS612224,Inner Thoughts,Seems like Komatsu likes to
run all year round...
DS612225,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,But sometimes I even get lost in the parks.
DS612226,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,I'll be running laps and then next thing
I know I'm not even in the park anymore!
DS612227,N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>mie Komatsu,Pretty weird, huh? Maybe it's some
kinda distortion in space and time?
DS612228,Inner Thoughts,I enjoyed aimless banter

search the area.
GQ00005,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems as though this
door won't open...
GQ00006,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hm... It looks like it requires a special
kind of key.
GQ00007,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems this door
can't be opened.
GQ8420001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It appears as though it can only be opened
from the inside.
GQ8460001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,This rail seems moveable...
We should see if there's a way
to make it move.
GQ8450001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,This door looks pretty fragile.
We may be able to destroy it with some effort
 if we give it a try.
GQ5500001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems we can't keep going from here.
Is there any way around the back?
GQ5502002,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I don't think we can get through right now.
We ought to try something else.
GQ5502004,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I think you'll need to defeat the <color=#FF423F>Shadows
in the back</color> before I can continue.
GQ5502008,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,AAAAAA==
GQ5504918,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,That treasure chest... Something about it

GQ550491801,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,If I'm not mistaken, it has something to do
with the <color=#FF423F>Shadow next to it</color>.
GQ5504919,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What would a drum barrel be doing here?
Most odd. Let's investigate it.
GQ550491901,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's <color=#FF423F>slam into it</color> with everything we've
got. Who knows, there may be something
hidden inside!
GQ550491902,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoo hoot! What a haul!
GQ5504920,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Another drum...
Let's check it out.
GQ550492001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems that Shadow left something
behind when it ran off.
GQ550492002,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,<color=#FF423F>Slam into it</color> again!

even better.
GQ5504921,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,There seems to be a crack in this wall.
GQ550492101,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Couldn't it be possible to <color=#FF423F>destroy</color> this too?
GQ550492102,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Yes, just as I thought. Let's take a look
inside of here.
GQ5502009,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It appears to be different from before.
GQ5502010,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,While this structure may look similar,
the aura is completely different.
GQ5502011,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It seems that the entrance in Mementos
vanishes once a Palace is destroyed.
GQ5502012,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's keep going. I doubt there's anything
here for us to see.
GQ5502013,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I feel as though Mementos is a bit less
warped than before.
GQ5502014,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,Exactly! You really know your stuff,
don't ya?
GQ5502017,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,These fare adjustment machines are dotted
all around Mementos, so use
whichever ones you please!
GQ5502018,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,This woman and her sales pitches... Clearly,
we have no use for this.
GQ5502019,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,Well, excuse me, darlin', but it's not just
me who benefits from you usin' them machines.
You'd regret sitting this one out!
GQ5502020,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I see. Wonder, what do you think?
GQ5502022,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,All right, I trust your judgment.
GQ5502023,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I don't really get what's going on here, but
I don't feel like she's out to cause trouble
for us.
GQ5502024,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,I'd be ever so much obliged to get a ticket,
and I bet you'd be real happy to see this
distortion fixed.
GQ550202401,Mart<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>ym,I am a merchant, after all! Lend me a helping
hand and I promise I'll make it worth
your while.
GQ5502025,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Things seem to have changed up ahead due to
that ticket we just gave the Shadow.
GQ5502026,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let's go check it out, Wonder.
GQ5502027,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What's this? I can't ascertain the reason,
but our path is blocked by some sort of
inexplicable distortion.
GQ5502028,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I say we ought to investigate.
GQ5502029,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Right. I'm kinda curious about what's going
on, too... Let's go check it out.
GQ5506001,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Wonder, something about this place... It
doesn't feel right.
GQ5506002,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,These two gates of fog and the presence I
sense within feel exceptionally unique.
GQ5506003,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Let me concentrate for a moment to confirm.
GQ5506004,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hmm... I sense that this is the right way.
GQ5506005,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,We ought to be able to go to the next floor
if we proceed this way.
GQ5506006,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,The other direction isn't necessarily a wrong
choice either.
GQ5506007,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Exploring the area and gathering anything
that could help us in our mission 
a valid option as well.
GQ5506008,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,You ought to be the one to choose what
we do.
GQ5506009,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Part of being a leader is making appropriate
decisions for the group.
GQ5506101,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom? Hold on a second, Wonder.
Look at that.
GQ5506102,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,What a curious phenomenon... Perhaps we
should call it a whirlwind.
GQ5506103,Choices,Why whirlwind"?|What is that thing?
GQ5506104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This is merely speculation	 but it
appears to be a frenzy of turbulent desires
that have accumulated here.
GQ5506105	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They yearn to move swifter	 to reach their
destination with greater haste.
GQ5506106	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is their desire for speed given form.
I'm sure you have experienced a
familiar feeling.
GQ5506107	Choices	Yeah	 on a crowded train.|Time on a plane never flies by.
GQ5506108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Precisely. Why not test it to discern what
power it holds?
GQ5506109	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oho! At this speed	 we're practically flying!
Let's make good use of these.
GQ5510001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait. I sense an ominous presence ahead.
GQ5510002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The path ahead seems to have collapsed.
We'll fall if we keep going.
GQ5510003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a bit far for me to fly across
carrying all of you...
GQ5510004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's see if there's some other way there.
GQ5510005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The wind here is quite strong.
GQ5510006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we were to use this wind... We just might
be able to <color=#FF423F>fly to the other side</color>.
GQ5510007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A smashing success!
GQ5510008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I believe we'll be able to <color=#FF423F>fly across</color> other
collapsed paths under the same circumstances.
GQ5510009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hold on. I sense Shadows...
GQ5510010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't spot any	 though. It seems that they
must be hiding.
GQ5510011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They can't obfuscate their presence entirely
though. Allow me to handle this.
GQ5510012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll track down these Shadows by following
their presence.
GQ5510013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The door appears to be locked.
GQ5510014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is unlikely that we'll be able to break
through from the front.
GQ5510015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps we can unlock the door from the
other side.
GQ5510016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us leave this for now	 and investigate it
at another time...
GQ5510017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Shadows are after the treasure chest!?
GQ5510018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What exactly is going on here?
Let's investigate.
GQ5510019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They're attempting to flee!
Hurry and catch them!
GQ5510020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agh... They've escaped. Let's endeavour to
catch them if we cross paths again.
GQ5520001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This looks somewhat different to the previous
Whirlwinds we've encountered.
GQ5520002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense a stronger presence than usual.
Perhaps...
GQ5520003	Choices	More desire is gathered here?|Is it like a condensed Whirlwind?
GQ5520004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we are on the same page. You have a
keen eye.
GQ5520005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've no inkling of what this may yield	 but
let's pass through it and see what happens.
GQ5520006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! What's going on!?
GQ5520007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... It has the same characteristics as
the Whirlwinds	 but is more powerful
and convenient.
GQ5520008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose we could call it a Cluster Whirlwind.
We can make use of these to rapidly increase
our speed of travel.

for another way.
GQ8501105	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This kinda feels like trespassing...
GQ8501106	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We're not in the real world. Don't let it
worry you.
GQ8501110	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Do we really have to go in this way?
It looks all wet and gross...
GQ8501111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I understand your concern	 but there is no
other way.
GQ8501112	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We can only hope that no sewage
is discharged.
GQ8511101	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well	 we're in. Let's just hurry and find a
way out of here.
GQ8511103	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 isn't that a bit weird? Looks like it's
not drainin' at all.
GQ8511104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... That is unusual	 but it's because of
that that we were able to get in. We should
consider it serendipitous.
GQ8511110	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's the door... But how do we get it
open? I see nothing resembling a lever
or switch...
GQ8511111	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's some sort of device next to it.
Should we see what it does?
GQ8511112	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa! It opened!
GQ8511113	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... So we can use that device to operate
doors	 it would seem.
GQ8511114	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The device appears to be battery-powered	
which would indicate it requires energy
to activate.
GQ8511115	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Energy	 huh... Got a bad feelin' about this.
GQ8511121	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What is this?
GQ8511122	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 look at this.
GQ8511125	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This screen... It looks like it displays the
current condition of the dam?
GQ8511126	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... In short	 I suppose this could be
considered the dam's control room.
GQ8511127	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Dam Water Level Abnormal	 "Power Over
Capacity"... Things do not seem to be
going well.
GQ8511131	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Power over capacity? Then why couldn't we
get the door open?
GQ8511133	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not sure what it could be	 but it's
worth investigating.
GQ8511140	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a dead end. Could there be another
path nearby?
GQ8511145	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is that a Shadow up there?
GQ8511146	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Shhh! Quiet!
GQ8511147	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Energy transfer is almost complete. Should
be more than sufficient this time.
GQ8511150	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is that the Shadow you mentioned earlier?
What's that device he's operating...?
GQ8511151	Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	The operation commands are entered...
Alright	 let's get to work!
GQ8511152	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	What!? Intruders!
GQ8511155	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then	 let's try entering the operation
command that Shadow used earlier.
GQ8511156	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like it's turned on. Now what can
we do?
GQ8511157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A "Portable Energy Absorber"... It seems we
should be able to <color=#FF423F>absorb and release energy</color>
with this.
GQ8511158	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Absorb and release? What d'you mean by that?
GQ8511159	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Rather than a lengthy explanation	 I think
a demonstration would be sufficient. Wonder	
try using it now.
GQ8511165	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It looks like the energy's been sent out.
GQ8511166	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... Now isn't that convenient?
GQ8511167	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we find any similar devices later	 we
should be sure to use them. Don't forget that
operation command!
GQ8511170	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is this a map? It says "Lower Level"...
GQ8511171	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense the treasure is still quite far.
Probably much higher up.
GQ8511172	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It appears there's a storage area and an
elevator ahead. Let's keep going	 Wonder.
GQ8511180	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 Shadows!?
GQ8511181	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 now	 that's way too many of 'em!
GQ8511183	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 it's as Wonder says. I don't sense
the presence of enemy Shadows here.
GQ8511184	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Really?
GQ8511185	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Then... who are these people? Uh	 if
people is the right word...
GQ8511186	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These are cognitive manifestations created
by the Palace ruler's perceptions...
it would seem.
GQ8511187	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right	 right... So	 what you're saying is	
we don't have to worry about them attacking us?
GQ8511188	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Think we can communicate? Let's try talkin'
to 'em.
GQ8511190	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. I do suppose it could be worth a try.
But do be careful not to provoke any
unwanted attention.
GQ8511191	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A fine idea. If we play our cards right	 we
could learn something valuable.
GQ8511200	AAAAAA==	Huh? Are you all here on a tour? Sorry	 you
came at a bad time...
GQ8511202	AAAAAA==	The <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color> ordered power generation
to be set to full capacity. Some parts of the
dam even had their power cut.
GQ8511203	AAAAAA==	Thanks to that	 we can't get out of here	
and we can't do our jobs at the <color=#FF423F>Water
Treatment Plant</color>.
GQ8511205	AAAAAA==	Say	 did you... defeat those scary-looking
guys?
GQ8511207	AAAAAA==	Wow	 you're amazing! I was too scared to
go anywhere near them...
GQ8511208	AAAAAA==	They showed up with that <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color>.
They're obsessed with gathering energy.
GQ8511210	AAAAAA==	This place is a mess... and we've got no
idea where <color=#FF423F>Katayama-sama</color> has gone off to!
GQ8511212	AAAAAA==	<color=#FF423F>Katayama-sama</color> should be at the Power Plant	
where she works round the clock to generate
power.
GQ8511213	AAAAAA==	But	 if we keep working at full capacity
like this	 the dam's likely to burst...
GQ8511220	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems we were able to learn something
rather useful.
GQ8511221	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yep. Just like we thought	 the dam... well	
the Palace is in a pretty bad condition.
GQ8511222	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Also	 this <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color> he mentioned...
that was Ms. Katayama	 wasn't it?
GQ8511223	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hard to say... but that would mean this is
Ms. Katayama's Palace	 then.
GQ8511224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... But there was something odd about
the way he referred to Katayama as
the supervisor.
GQ8511226	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're right. Standing around thinking will
get us nowhere. We must proceed.
GQ8511230	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Guess we'll need some energy to open
this one	 too.
GQ8511231	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... First	 let us look for the
control device.
GQ8511235	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To open this shutter	 it appears we will
require two energy.
GQ8511237	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Alright	 looks like that worked!
GQ8511240	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? That door...
GQ8511241	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's closed	 huh? Guess we'll have to take
care of these Shadows to open it up.
GQ8511242	AAAAAA==	That <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color>... is terrifying... I'm
just going to hide here! I'm not opening
that door for anything!
GQ8511243	AAAAAA==	......
GQ8511244	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Shoot... It's locked up tight.
GQ8511245	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't think we'll get in that easily...
Let's come back later	 Wonder.
GQ8511270	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like this elevator's not moving.
GQ8511271	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So how're we supposed to go down?
GQ8511272	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We may be able to jump down using that cargo.
GQ8511273	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	From this height? Well	 I can probably manage
that	 but what do we do if the elevator
suddenly starts movin' again?
GQ8511274	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That would be extremely dangerous. Let's do
this carefully.
GQ8511275	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Made it down safely... Phew	 I was sweatin'
back there.
GQ8511277	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we can enter from here.
GQ8511278	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Going through the ducts is a very phantom
thief-like method. Since I've made it
this far	 allow me to go first.
GQ8511279	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nope	 no way! At times like these	 let the
boys take the lead!
GQ8511280	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa! What the heck is this!?
GQ8511281	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You okay? You're not burned	 are you?
GQ8511282	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears to be high-temperature steam...
We can't enter through here. We'll have to
find a different way.
GQ8511285	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like there's a way through here. I was
starting to get worried.
GQ8511290	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It says we're on the mid-level. We'll need
to go around to reach the next elevator.
GQ8511291	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We got this far. There's no way Akashi's
Shadow can catch us	 right?
GQ8511292	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? There's something on the monitor...
GQ8511293	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's an alert for a temperature malfunction.
GQ8511294	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There must be an issue with the temperature
control system. It may have caused the steam
from earlier.
GQ8511295	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There's a cooling facility on the map.
Perhaps we should start there.
GQ8511297	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You've already got the hang of things	 huh?
You're really somethin'	 senpai.
GQ8511298	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's nothing	 really.
GQ8511299	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It's the least I could do when I'm not much
of a fighter.
GQ8511300	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're a big help	 senpai! Now	 let's head
to that cooling facility.
GQ8511310	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's boiling in here... That <color=#FF423F>thermal energy</color>
just keeps coming.
GQ8511311	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	With this much energy	 we'll be done in
no time!
GQ8511312	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That bastard is still stealing energy from
Katayama-san... You're done!
GQ8511313	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Intruders!? Let me at 'em! You'll be the
ones wiping the floor!
GQ8511315	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	This device should divert the energy.
GQ8511316	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The Shadow from earlier mentioned something
about an <color=#FF423F>energy key</color>...
GQ8511318	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Perhaps we could use this device to solve
the steam issue.
GQ8511319	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... An interesting idea. Let's quickly
test it	 Wonder.
GQ8511325	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Look! The steam's gone!
GQ8511326	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa. Wouldn't have thought to use it
like that.
GQ8511327	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We can use this on electricity and even
filter out thermal energy from the
reservoir tank.
GQ8511329	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So you're implying that anything with energy
can be filtered...
GQ8511330	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Either way	 it's a great boon in this
Palace. Let's use it to our advantage.
GQ8511340	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So this is the cooling facility... Those
fans are huge!
GQ8511341	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But they're not moving...
GQ8511342	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The control room should be above us.
Let's go there.
GQ8511345	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The water here looks really hot...
GQ8511346	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Better to keep away from it. Wouldn't want
to get cooked.
GQ8511350	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The elevator isn't moving. It must
require energy.
GQ8511351	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There doesn't look like there's any
devices around...
GQ8511352	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Even without electricty	 there is another
way to power the elevator.
GQ8511353	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What d'ya mean?
GQ8511355	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Correct. If the device can filter energy...
GQ8511357	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. It seems it operates using something
<color=#FF423F>other than electric or thermal energy</color>.
GQ8511358	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What other energy is there?
I've got nothing...
GQ8511359	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Same... Is there any energy that we can use
around here?
GQ8511361	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	That should work. We can use the fan's
kinetic energy. Very observant	 Wonder.
GQ8511362	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then that's settled. Let's give it a go.
GQ8511370	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It worked!
GQ8511371	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Nicely done!
GQ8511375	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This door also requires energy to open.
GQ8511376	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Wonder	 you know what to do.
GQ8511380	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That went well!
GQ8511381	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We can get into the control room now!
GQ8511390	AAAAAA==	How'd you get in here!?
GQ8511391	AAAAAA==	You ain't getting past me!
GQ8511400	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The cooling facility is also in a
concerning state.
GQ8511401	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The high temperature seems to be a result
of the main fan being broken.
GQ8511402	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We won't be able to get out of here if we
don't move it...
GQ8511403	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're right... Let's go down the stairs...
GQ8511404	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's examine the main fan first.
GQ8511410	AAAAAA==	Somebody finally came! I've been stuck
here forever...
GQ8511411	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Are you a worker here?
GQ8511412	AAAAAA==	Ah	 that's right. As you can see	 the main
fan's chain is broken.
GQ8511413	AAAAAA==	To get the main fan working	 we need to
change out three chains.
GQ8511414	AAAAAA==	But it's dangerous to go out anywhere...
GQ8511415	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we get you three chains	 you'll be able
to fix it?
GQ8511416	AAAAAA==	Of course. You can count on it.
GQ8511417	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Got it. Let's look around for them.
GQ8511420	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey! I found one!
GQ8511421	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Soy! Wait...
GQ8511422	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The hell!? The chain just changed!
GQ8511423	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is that a lighter? That's weird.
GQ8511424	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The worker won't be able to use that...
GQ8511425	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Let's bring it with us. Let's look
for other chains.
GQ8511430	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Why's there a projector here?
GQ8511431	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Naturally to project something. But what...?
GQ8511432	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What's wrong	 Wonder?
GQ8511434	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's it mean? Should we light it?
GQ8511435	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way. That'd be too dangerous.
GQ8511436	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Why not try putting it on the projector?
Maybe it'll trigger something.
GQ8511438	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 what will it show us?
GQ8511440	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is...
GQ8511441	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The lighter turned back into a chain!
GQ8511442	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It returned to normal after we watched
that film.
GQ8511443	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I wonder why it showed us that...
GQ8511444	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't know but we managed to acquire our
first chain. Let us search for the others.
GQ8511450	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's really steamy down there...
GQ8511451	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That may be so	 but if we want to get
that second <color=#FF423F>chain</color>	 we have no choice
but to enter.
GQ8511452	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	We could use the energy transmission device
to filter the thermal energy.
GQ8511453	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Let's find the device first.
GQ8511457	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can make our way safely now.
GQ8511458	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Great! Let's get going!
GQ8511460	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course this had to change too. This time
it's a bowl?
GQ8511461	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 isn't that...?
GQ8511462	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	There should be a projector up ahead.
Let's bring it with us.
GQ8511465	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	......
GQ8511470	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Something like that did happen...
GQ8511471	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Katayama-san...
GQ8511472	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The bowl turned back into a chain.
Just one more to go.
GQ8511473	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Stay focused! That'll have to wait!
GQ8511480	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's just like before. It looks like they
turned up the steam.
GQ8511481	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'll leave it to you	 leader!
GQ8511485	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	You handled it skillfully.
GQ8511486	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Amazing as always	 Wonder!
GQ8511490	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	The third chain changed too. This time's a
coffee cup?
GQ8511491	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Let's take it to a projector.
GQ8511495	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Try putting the coffee cup on the projector.
GQ8511500	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It turned back into a chain... With this we
have all three.
GQ8511501	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That took forever! Let's get back to the
cooling facility.
GQ8511510	AAAAAA==	You made it back! Did you find the chains?
GQ8511511	AAAAAA==	Great! You found them! I'll get this fixed
in a jiffy!
GQ8511512	AAAAAA==	First this... Connect that... Right then	
let's try turning it on.
GQ8511513	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It feels cooler already.
GQ8511514	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	It should be safer for us to move around now.
GQ8511515	AAAAAA==	You guys wanted to get above ground	 right?
There's still one working elevator.
GQ8511516	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There doesn't seem to be a treasure here.
Let's go above ground.
GQ8511520	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This looks like an exit.
GQ8511521	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I cannot sense what lies ahead. It's also
risky with one person unable to fight.
GQ8511522	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Everyone	 stay alert.

GQ33001003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Traces left behind by Shadows	 I suspect.
GQ33001004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 perhaps we should search this area
again?
GQ33001005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Any idea where the key might be	 Wonder?
GQ33001006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I feel there may be clues nearby...
GQ33001007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Curses	 that was the wrong order!
We've been discovered by the enemy!
GQ33001008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Observe carefully	 Wonder.
GQ33001009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's closed... It appears our path
is blocked.
GQ33001010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's something peculiar about this gate.
GQ33001011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... A fragment of a key of some sort?
GQ33001012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't use it yet
Let's search around for the remaining pieces.
GQ33001013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 that looks like it might fit with
the key fragment we found!
GQ33001014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent	 this key should help with several
troublesome mechanisms.
GQ33001015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There may be hints around here...
Let's search the area.
GQ33001016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 that took us outside	 somehow...
GQ33001017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's nothing left to find here.
Let's go back	 Wonder.
GQ33001018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The patrolling Shadows are blocking off
the exit. How troublesome...
GQ33001019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time to fight	 Wonder!
GQ33001020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 we'll need to gather information
quickly	 before we're discovered.
GQ33001021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 that's a Shadow ahead!
It seems to be blocking the exit.
GQ33001022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can proceed when you're ready	 Wonder.
GQ33001023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us continue after a short break.
GQ33001024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 it seems we can use that key here.
GQ33001025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... There should be clues nearby.
GQ33001026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's what we were looking for...
Let's go	 Wonder.
GQ33001027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm sensing a powerful Shadow	 Wonder!
GQ33001028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Metaverse Navigator is working again.
Let us take our leave	 Wonder.
GQ33001029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A mechanism somewhere just started up...
GQ33001030	Guarding Samurai	Hey	 have the intruders been by here?
GQ33001031	Watchful Samurai	No	 I haven't seen anything...
GQ33001032	Guarding Samurai	I was sure I saw something moving...
You'd better not be shirking your duties!
GQ33001033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All the water's gone now...
GQ33001034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There might be some connection between the
box and the planks in the pond-bed...
GQ33001035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From here on is an uncharted area. Stay on
your guard.
GQ33001036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All the doors have been opened now. Nicely
done	 Wonder.
GQ33001037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wh-What!? Wonder	 be careful going forward!
GQ33001038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Quite a lot of enemies here...
GQ33001039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would behoove us to try and avoid the
Shadows on guard here.
GQ33001040	Old Castle Soldier	I heard we have some intruders around here.
GQ33001041	Old Castle Soldier	Make sure to keep your keys well hidden!
GQ33001042	Old Castle Guard	Yes sir!
GQ33001043	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take care not to be discovered.
GQ33001044	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We may be able to glean hints from
their conversations.
GQ33001045	Old Castle Guard	What've you heard about these intruders?
I hear there's a group of 'em.
GQ33001046	Old Castle Guard	One female was captured and put
in the Underground Prison	 but the rest
are still on the loose!
GQ33001047	Old Castle Guard	You there	 intruders!
You're coming with us!
GQ41011001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The front gate is open now	 but we can't
let our guards down yet.
GQ41033001	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Look at the black paint on this one!
GQ41033002	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I remember Kamoshida's Palace having hidden
passages behind paintings...
GQ41033003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is that so? Wonder	 examine that painting
more closely.
GQ41033004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The distortion here is getting worse...
GQ41033005	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mewheheh	 that means we're getting closer to the
Core!
GQ41033006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Let's continue on then	 Wonder.
GQ41033007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 look at that!
There's a grate in the way!
GQ41033008	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Kamoshida's Palace had mechanisms like this
too	 if I remember right...
GQ41033009	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yup	 sure did!
We had to pull the chains to get past 'em.
GQ41033010	Old Castle Guard	Intruders spotted!
GQ41033011	Elite Guard	Get them!
GQ41033012	Old Castle Guard	Yessir!
GQ41033013	Elite Guard	Hm? Is that...?
GQ41033014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've been spotted	 look out!
GQ41033015	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Damn	 door's locked... Can't go this way!
GQ41033016	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Indeed. Let's go back and think of another
way to get into the west building.
GQ33001065	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The key we got from the Shadows seems to be
for the underground prison.
GQ33001066	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's possible everyone has been locked up
down there...
GQ33001067	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	When you're done resting	 we should go to the
underground prison to rescue them.
GQ41081001	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So	 we're back in the west building...
GQ41081002	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	But isn't this whole place locked up?
How're we supposed find a key here?
GQ41081003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We have to find a way to open this door.
If only there were any clues nearby...
GQ41081004	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hey	 fellas	 isn't there something strange
about these statues?
GQ41081005	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? What're you talkin' about? There's...
Wait	 this one's got no shield!
GQ41081006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And this one doesn't have a weapon!
GQ41081007	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Exactly. They're different from the others.
GQ41081008	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Maybe if we give 'em what they're missing	
that'll unlock the door?
GQ41081009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's an armory near here	 isn't there?
Let's see if we can find what we need there.
GQ41081010	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 good idea! Let's go have a look!
GQ41081011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is the armory. Hopefully we can find
equipment for those statues...
GQ41081012	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Jackpot! There's a ton of stuff here!
GQ41081013	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Time to loot this place!
GQ41081014	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That's got us two weapons.
But we still need two shields	 yeah?
GQ41081015	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	And this armory has... zero shields.
GQ41081016	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Guess we'll have to look somewhere else.
GQ41081017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Look	 we got shields here!
GQ41081018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we take these with us?
GQ41081019	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! The statue moved!
GQ41081020	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Shadows pretending to be statues	 huh?
Get ready to fight!
GQ41081021	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That's all the shields we need!
GQ41081022	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Okay	 let's get back to those weird statues!
GQ41081023	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	A door unlocked!
I was right on the money!
GQ41081024	Old Castle Guard	Hey	 you! What're you doing there!?
GQ41081025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've been caught!
Better silence them quickly!
GQ41081026	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Got it! Let's go	 you bastards!
GQ41081027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This seems to be... a key?
GQ41081028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps it might open that door we saw
earlier.
GQ41081029	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That'd be nice! How 'bout we take
a little break and then go back to check?
GQ41081030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's not head that way yet.
There are things we need to get done first.
GQ41081031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's continue after we obtain those <color=#FF423F>shields</color>.
GQ41081032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can move forward after we find those <color=#FF423F>weapons</color>.
GQ41081033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We don't have enough <color=#FF423F>shields</color> yet	 Wonder!
GQ41081034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We still need to find more <color=#FF423F>weapons</color>	 Wonder!
GQ41081035	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We'll be taking that shield off your hands!
GQ41081036	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	There might be another shield here!
Let's look around.
GQ41081037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like the gate came down!
GQ41081038	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So	 there's no goin' back	 huh... You think
somebody's controllin' this thing?
GQ41081039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't be sure... Let's focus on
the shields and weapons for now.
GQ41161001	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You want to put the ball there?
GQ41161003	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	All right	 here we go!
GQ41161004	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Seriously though	 what's with this door?
Who the hell needs a door that big?
GQ41161005	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ooh	 I'm sensing...
Mewhehehee	 the core's close	 for sure!
GQ41011002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 let's go check the <color=#FF423F>Castle Gates</color>.
GQ41043001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems there's a proper order to this...
GQ41043002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That didn't work... Why don't we reconsider
the pattern here and try again?
GQ41043003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Blast	 the Shadows have noticed us!
GQ41043004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm sensing an enemy...
GQ41043009	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The armor moved!
GQ41043005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's been sealed off!
GQ41043006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We can keep going through here	 I think.
GQ41043007	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Yeah	 now that we've made it this far...
GQ41043008	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The enemies ahead will probably be tougher.
Be careful	 everyone!
GQ41043010	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Look	 there's something over here!
GQ41043011	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	A statue guarding a treasure chest...
There could be something valuable in there!
GQ41043012	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The gates blocking off the treasure are
blocking the exit	 too.
GQ41043013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've seen this mechanism before	 though
there may be new tricks to it this time...
GQ41043014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 perhaps your powers of observation
may be able to spot something?
GQ41043015	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Nice	 the gates all lifted!
GQ41043016	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This hall should take us to the first floor.
GQ41043017	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	But we haven't got these weird-ass gates
lifted yet.
GQ41043018	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Besides	 do we know where this door
even goes?
GQ41043019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no telling until we find a key.
GQ41043020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo! That appears to have been the
right order!
GQ41043021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This must be done in the correct sequence.
We'll need to learn the order from somewhere.
GQ41043022	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah	 I know! Anyway	 where'd Joker and
Panther disappear to?
GQ41043023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo hoo	 a true Phantom Bond!
GQ41043024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 we'll find them for sure!
GQ41043025	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mwehehe	 let's get going then!
GQ41043026	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hold on	 Wonder.
GQ41043027	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Isn't there something off about this? It's
like the treasure's begging to be stolen!
GQ41043028	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Don't worry about it! Just bust that
<color=#FF423F>treasure chest</color> open!
GQ41043029	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I don't think that's a good idea... At least
be careful about it!
GQ41043030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you think	 Wonder? Shall we open it?
GQ41041001	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Damn... We can't open it from here	 huh?
GQ41041002	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	If it's built the same way	 can we get to
the second floor from <color=#FF423F>outside the gates</color>?
GQ41041003	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Okay	 let's try outside the gates	 then!
GQ41042001	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We should be able to get in from above.
GQ41041004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's head to the west building and continue
from there.
GQ41061001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've arrived at the underground prison
unscathed.
GQ41061002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hopefully we'll find some information
about our missing allies here...
GQ41061003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In any case	 our only hope lies ahead.
Onward!
GQ41061004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This door appears to be locked...
GQ41061005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be another way around.
GQ41061006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why don't we search the area?
GQ41061007	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Wait	 look!
GQ41061008	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	It looks like Panther left behind a clue for us!
GQ41061009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom	 so it appears.
GQ41061010	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	There should be a clue in this cell	 too!
GQ41061011	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	But the door's locked...
GQ41061012	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Maybe the Shadows on guard would have a key?
GQ41061013	Old Castle Guard	Intruders! Get them!
GQ41061014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This key should open the cell door...
GQ41061015	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What are you waiting for?
Try it!
GQ41061016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait. Shouldn't there be Shadows here?
Doesn't their absence seem strange?
GQ41061017	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Now that you mention it	 you're right...
GQ41061018	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We'd better tread carefully here. Let's scout
the perimeter	 first.
GQ41061019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. There must be something
important nearby...
GQ41061020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Based on the location of our previous clues	
the one called "Panther" may be over there.
GQ41061021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 there may be another clue over there!
GQ41071001	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	This bridge wasn't raised before	 right?
GQ41071002	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Are these footprints? Could they be Joker's?
But they just end here...
GQ41071003	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	The door's locked... We can't go on this way.
GQ41071004	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Gotta go find the key!
GQ41071005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed	 but there's no sign of a key here.
We should return to the west wing for now.
GQ41071006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This mechanism seems locked...
GQ41071007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But it closely resembles others we've seen.
GQ41071008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Some Shadow in this vicinity
may be holding the key.
GQ41071009	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Should we look around	 then?
GQ41071010	Prison Guard	Intruders	 stop them!
GQ41071011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well that was exhausting... Perhaps a short
break is in order?
GQ41071012	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I like the sound of that! First a break	
then the west wing!
GQ41071013	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	But I have to wonder... Where is Joker now?
GQ41071014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks dangerous ahead...
GQ41071015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Make sure you're ready to proceed.
GQ41071016	Choices	Let's get going.|I'm not ready yet.
GQ41131001	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 we make a pretty great team together	
huh? Let's keep this ball rollin'!
GQ41131002	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Keep your voice down	 idiot!
GQ41131003	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh crap	 I can hear 'em coming this way! And
a lot of 'em	 too!
GQ41131004	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	It'll be a pain if they find us here...
GQ41131005	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Let's go in that room and hide for now!
GQ41131006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The exit is blocked by a grate...
GQ41131007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Maybe there's a mechanism to open it nearby?
GQ41131008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very good	 now we can pass. Let's go	 Wonder.
GQ41131009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm	 there's a box behind that grate...
GQ41131010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It might be useful somehow.
GQ41131011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... The path is blocked.
GQ41131012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just use that <color=#FF423F>box</color> to clear the way	 Wonder.
GQ41131013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good work	 Wonder!
GQ41131014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 please search the area.
GQ41131015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perfect	 all the grates are open now!
GQ41131016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now we can move to the next area.
GQ41131017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hold on	 Wonder	 I'm sensing a dangerous
presence...
GQ41131018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There might a trap laid for us ahead.
GQ41131019	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Well we won't know if we don't look	 right?
C'mon	 let's go!
GQ41131020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... There's another grate in the way.
GQ41131021	Mysterious Voice	So	 you're the ones who've been running
amuck through the church	 then?
GQ41131022	Mysterious Voice	I see waiting for you here has paid off.
GQ41131023	Elite Guard	You have quite the nerve	 invading the very
place I stand guard!
GQ41131024	Elite Guard	Get them!
GQ41131025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tsk... An ambush	 is it!?
Prepare yourselves!
GQ41131026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've dealt with the lackeys. Now for their
commander.
GQ41131027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>ball</color> we're missing should be this way.
Onward	 Wonder!
GQ41131028	Elite Guard	Bold move	 but you're not getting through!
GQ41131029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good work	 Wonder!
GQ41131030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be a <color=#FF423F>mechanism</color> to open this grate
nearby. Let's find it.
GQ41033017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The grate's been lifted now!
GQ41091001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It was quite the endeavor	 but we've made it
here at last.
GQ41091002	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I hope that key actually works here...
GQ41091003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come on	 Wonder	 try it!
GQ41091004	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ahead is the underground walkway to the
Training Hall of Love. Be careful!
GQ41092001	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Joker's not here either	 huh...
GQ41092002	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Where the hell is he	 seriously?
GQ41092003	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? That thing over there...
GQ41092004	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Is that a clue from Joker!?
GQ41092005	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Joker might be this way	 then! Let's keep
going!
GQ41092006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a Shadow blocking the way.
GQ41092007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose our only choice is to fight.
GQ41092008	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Wait a minute!
GQ41092009	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The Training Hall of Love has some pretty
fierce Shadows guarding it.
GQ41092010	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We should take a minute to rest and get
ready before we go in.
GQ41092011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 that sounds like a good idea. We just
got through a pretty tough fight	 after all.
GQ41092012	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah	 sounds good to me.
GQ41093001	Woman's Voice	Help...
GQ41093002	Woman's <#000000	V	#FFFFFF>oice	Somebody	 help!
GQ41093003	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 wait... Did you just hear someone call
for help?
GQ41093004	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I did! I think it came from up ahead!
GQ41093005	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's go see what's going on!
GQ41093006	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	We heard that shouting from this way	 but...
GQ41093007	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	It's another closed door! Can we just kick
it down this time!?
GQ41093008	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hold your horses	 Skull! That door's not
going to fall to a couple kicks.
GQ41093009	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	There's a lever over there	 we can just...
GQ41093010	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Not move it an inch! The lever must be
locked.
GQ41093011	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	No choice but to go find a key	 then.
GQ41093012	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Back to keys again	 huh...?
GQ41093013	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Whining about it won't help! Just get
it done!
GQ41093014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well I don't see any keys... Where could it
be?
GQ41093015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*giggle*
GQ41093016	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mewhehehee!
GQ41093017	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What are you two laughing about?
GQ41093018	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Huh? Oh	 there's something funny about that
Shadow over there.
GQ41093019	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	My instincts are telling me it might have
a key on it.
GQ41093020	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We should jump it before it spots us!
GQ41093021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh my! It really did have the key!
GQ41093022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The instincts of a quasi-cat are not to be
trifled with... We should head back	 then.
GQ41094001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like another new area.
GQ41094002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suspect there's treasure in here.
GQ41094003	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Let's make that treasure ours	 then!
GQ41093023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The lever won't move... We'll need to find a
<color=#FF423F>key</color> first.
GQ41092013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So that means...
GQ41092014	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	This's some kinda key at least.
GQ41092015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we <color=#FF423F>retrace our steps</color>? There may be a
<color=#FF423F>locked</color> door back there.
GQ41092016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The door isn't opening...
GQ41092017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There may be a <color=#FF423F>key</color> somewhere. Let's search.
GQ41093024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can hear voices below us... <color=#FF423F>Shall we take
a peek</color>?
GQ41093025	Choices	Take a look.|Maybe later.
GQ41093026	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That's definitely a clue from Joker! He must
be up ahead now.
GQ41093027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we can get in from here.
GQ41093028	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Awesome! Now we can get going!
GQ41093029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That Shadow looks powerful. We should
make sure we're prepared to fight it.
GQ41093030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm sensing an enemy... Be careful	 Wonder.
GQ41033018	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Yes	 that's it!
GQ41033019	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	If we pull that chain	 it should raise the
grate!
GQ41033020	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But how are we going to get to it all the
way up there...?
GQ41041005	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	There's the hidden passage... But I guess it
won't get us all the way to the core.
GQ41041006	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This place is a little different from the
Palace last time...
GQ41041007	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Anyway	 let's start in the west wing!
GQ41041008	Old Castle Guard	Intruders! How did you get in here!?
GQ41041009	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	<color=#FF423F>Intruders</color>...?
GQ41041010	Old Castle Guard	We can't leave our post!
GQ41041011	Old Castle Guard	Forget about that	 catch them!
GQ41041012	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	<color=#FF423F>Intruders</color>? Don't tell me...!
GQ41113001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From here	 we'll be making our way along the outer wall of the castle.
GQ41113002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Our route may not be the most steady going forward.
GQ41113003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's proceed with caution.
GQ41113004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good work	 Wonder!
GQ41113005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keep it up!
GQ41113006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 wait!
GQ41113007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The area ahead is dangerous	 it would be
unwise to force our way through.
GQ41113008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should find the balls and stop the blades	
first.
GQ41113009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can go down the elevator later. We need to
find the <color=#FF423F>balls</color> first.
GQ41113010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First we need to find three <color=#FF423F>balls</color>. We can use
those to stop the <color=#FF423F>blade mechanism</color>.
GQ41113011	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tcher	The intruders have already made it this
far in!?
GQ41113012	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>tcher	Very well... I'll take you out here and now!
GQ41113013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like this area's full of boxes.
GQ41113014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	They're even blocking all the doorways.
Well	 this is annoying...
GQ41113015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Boxes stacked high	 as well as a lone box
off on its own... I see.
GQ41113016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I recall a similar contraption from Kiuchi's
Palace. Perhaps we can learn from it.
GQ41113017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If the mechanisms are the same	 moving the
green-marked boxes into their correct places
will resolve this.
GQ41113018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_content_GQ41113018]
GQ41113019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's do a thorough search and find them.
I'll leave it to you	 Wonder.
GQ41113020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can't go down yet. Let's find the <color=#FF423F>balls</color>
first.
GQ41113021	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hm? Looks like they dropped something.
Is this... a baseball?
GQ41113022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know	 Kiuchi's Palace had
gimmicks that involved balls too.
GQ41113023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I recall seeing an ornament like this in
Kiuchi's Palace.
GQ41113024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Putting balls into the holes unlocked a door	
allowing us to proceed.
GQ41113025	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh	 nice! Then why don't we give that a try?
GQ41113027	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Whoa	 what's going on here!? This is way too
dangerous to go through!
GQ41113028	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	We're all gonna get chopped in two if we
don't stop those scythes first...
GQ41113029	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You said it	 we need to do something... Hm?
That round thing on the wall looks familiar.
GQ41113030	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right! There was something like it in
Kiuchi's Palace! It disabled the trap!
GQ41113031	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Back then	 we had to collect baseballs and
put them in the holes.
GQ41113032	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We might be able to stop the scythes by
messing with this device too!
GQ41113033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Error: tnxotb-[Dialog_content_GQ41113033]
GQ41113034	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Right? It's got three holes in it. Maybe
we need the same number of balls?
GQ41113035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very astute	 Panther. In which case	 let us
find the remaining two balls.
GQ41113036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nicely done! That appears to be the right spot. Now for the next one.
GQ41113037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll need to make some jumps here	 Wonder.
Take care.
GQ41113038	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Pretty big... and full of Shadows	 too.
Careful	 everyone.
GQ41113039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keep it up	 you're almost done.
GQ41113040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's all the box mazes solved... Let's move
forward.
GQ41121001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The area beyond here is unexplored territory.
GQ41121002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Stay vigilant	 Wonder.
GQ41121003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a Shadow.
GQ41121004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A strong one	 too. Be on guard!
GQ41121005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's something blocking the door from the
other side...
GQ41121006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That seems to have opened the path.
GQ41121007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps now we are able to advance?
GQ41121008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's locked?
GQ41121009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then I suppose that means we need a key.
GQ41121010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's look for another one of those
mechanisms	 Wonder.
GQ41121011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be more of those switches around. Let's continue our search.
GQ41121012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These Shadows are quite the nuisance...
GQ41121013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need to defeat them in order to
thoroughly investigate this room.
GQ41121014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We ought to look into suspicious places when we come across them.
GQ41121016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A key? There might be doors around here it
can open.
GQ41121017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This must be the last one.
GQ41121018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's move.
GQ41121019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadow detected!
GQ41121020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Stay alert	 Wonder.
GQ41121021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take a look around	 Wonder.
GQ41121022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This hall seems to be on high alert...
GQ41121023	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Guess they're feeling cautious. They might even be guarding something.
GQ41121024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I strongly anticipate that this "something"
is one of those <color=#FF423F>baseballs</color> we're after.
GQ41121025	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That huge statue sure does get your attention. Don't ya think it's a li'l suspicious?
GQ41121026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Aye... It does indeed.
GQ41121027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But it seems there is no way for us to get close to it.
GQ41121028	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	In a room this lavish	 there's gotta be a lever or something.
GQ41121029	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So we're not getting out of here till we find some sort of switch? Okay	 then let's get searching	 Wonder!
GQ41121030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That lever is terribly suspicious...
GQ41121031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent! We now have a means to get across!
GQ41121032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should be able to use it to leap to the other side.
GQ41121033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seems to be another scaffold we can use.
GQ41121034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us continue to search for these mechanisms.
GQ41121035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Try making your way to the other side	 Wonder.
GQ41121036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have a strong feeling that we'll find what we're looking for just ahead.
GQ41121037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This way appears to be blocked off...
GQ41121038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are there any mechanisms in the area that
would allow us to get past?
GQ41121039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a <color=#FF423F>ball</color> next to that statue!
GQ41121040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent	 it's open!
GQ41121041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Look	 one of those strange <color=#FF423F>volleyballs</color>!
GQ41121042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There should be more <color=#FF423F>volleyballs</color> around...
GQ41142002	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's called the Book of Baseball... but it's
entirely about Kiuchi's life!
GQ41142003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This seems kinda sketchy...
GQ41142004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed it does. We ought to keep it in
our possession	 just in case.
GQ41142006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a ghastly tome. A m√©lange of lust
for the opposite sex and a desire to suppress
them.
GQ41142007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A lot of girls' names are in here. Mine	
Tomoko's	 and plenty of others...
GQ41142008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears as though it's linked to Kiuchi.
Yet it's in this makeshift version of
Kamoshida's Palace?
GQ41142009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Whatever the case	 I suppose we ought to
hold onto it for safekeeping.
GQ41142011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The title says "Punishment	 but... It's all
about Kiuchi shoulder checking people!
GQ41142012,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Punishment"? All that coward did was
target vulnerable girls!
GQ41142013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears to be related to Kiuchi. We should
take this with us just in case.
GQ41142015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's try again when we have all the books.
GQ41142016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 then... Just one ball remains.
GQ41142017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The enemy is now on high alert. We must
proceed swiftly and judiciously.
GQ41142018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Where do you think the last ball's hiding?
GQ41142019	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I want to say there was a secret room inside
the library in Kamoshida's Palace.
GQ41142020	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah	 there was! This place is just like it	
so maybe it has the same kind of room?
GQ41142021	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That room totally had "we're hiding something
super important in here!" kinda vibes.
GQ41142022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. It's better to follow a lead than to
run around aimlessly. Let's go	 Wonder.
GQ41142023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Guess we can't brute force it. I don't see
anything around that'll move it	 either...
GQ41142024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hrm	 it doesn't look like there's
a mechanism.
GQ41142025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Drawing on past experience	 the mechanism
may be located elsewhere.
GQ41142026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For example	 all of the bookshelves here
appear to be missing volumes.
GQ41142027	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right! These shelves are missing one	
two	 three... Three books.
GQ41142028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So that means...
GQ41142029	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Line up the right books and open sesame	
we're in that secret room.
GQ41142030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph! You copycat... How dare you steal
my moment of brilliance!?
GQ41142031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey	 all I did was connect the dots! All you
were talking about was some old story!
GQ41142032	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mewhehehee... Being a Phantom Thief is all
about making actual use of your wisdom	
y'know?
GQ41142033	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Of course	 we won't know if the same method
will really work until we give it a try.
GQ41142034	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Wha‚Äî An alarm!?
GQ41142035	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa	 that's a lot of stomping coming
our way!
GQ41142036	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This is bad	 we've got to get out of
here fast!
GQ41142037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense a number of powerful foes...
GQ41142038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Flee with as much caution as possible	
we musn't be found!
GQ41142039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... The alarm finally stopped...
GQ41142040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 inserting an incorrect book must set off
the alarm.
GQ41142041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll have to find the right books	 then.
Off we go	 Wonder.
GQ41043032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll find a path from outside the gates	
and enter the west wing on the 2nd floor.
GQ41043033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 you may be able to jump on top of the
<color=#FF423F>wooden shelves</color> over there.
GQ41043034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not bad	 Wonder	 not bad at all!
GQ41043035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>window</color> up above is open. We may be able
to break in from there.
GQ41043036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Infiltration successful! Now on to the west
wing. Careful	 now.
GQ41043037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The hall is full of Shadows! Powerful ones	
at that.
GQ41043038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a large number of Shadows ahead.
Best not to approach them yet.
GQ41043039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Wonder! Let's keep moving.
GQ41043040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now we can begin searching the west wing.
GQ41043041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are Shadows here as well... What do
you want to do?
GQ41043042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's keep our distance and avoid combat as
much as possible.
GQ41043043	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Watch out	 Wonder	 there's a Shadow ahead!
GQ41043044	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There should be a <color=#FF423F>switch</color> nearby. Let's look.
GQ41043045	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 that's dealt with. Let's continue.
GQ41043046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This hall should take us to the first floor.
GQ41043047	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So whadda we do now?
GQ41043048	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We've got to find a way into the west wing.
GQ41043049	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	But there's a grate blockin' the way up	 we
can't get through now...
GQ41043050	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Why don't we use those <color=#FF423F>chandeliers</color> on the
ceiling to get there?
GQ41043051	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	If we go in through the <color=#FF423F>window above the
castle gate</color>	 we can get right on top of 'em!
GQ41043052	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... That might be worth a try.
GQ41043053	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	It's a plan! Let's head outside!
GQ41043055	Armored Soldier Captain	Quick	 find the intruders!
GQ41043056	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? What was that?
GQ41043057	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Look down!
GQ41043058	Armored Soldier Captain	Raise the alarm! Trespassers must not be
allowed inside this castle!
GQ41043059	Armored Soldier	Got it!
GQ41043060	Armored Soldier	Capture the intruders!
GQ41043061	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a sea of Shadows down there.
GQ41043062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Far too many to handle at once... We'll have
to avoid fighting here.
GQ41043063	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	While they're dilly-dallying around down
there	 we can get into the west wing!
GQ41043064	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh yeah	 we can get in from there	 right?
GQ41043065	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are Shadows quite nearby	 though...
GQ41043066	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	They haven't noticed us yet. We can ambush
'em and take 'em out!
GQ41043067	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see.
Well then	 let's give it a shot	 Wonder!
GQ41043068	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Damn. Got Shadows here	 too...
GQ41043069	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Better get 'em before we get got!
GQ41043070	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 I think another ambush is in order.
You have my full confidence	 Wonder.
GQ41043071	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Look	 a treasure chest!
GQ41043072	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	But with a grate in the way	 damn...
GQ41043073	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The mechanism looks different from the ones
we dealt with before...
GQ41043074	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	But there's sure to be a way to lift it!
GQ41043075	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed... Let us search the room for now.
GQ41043076	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time to use your power of <color=#FF423F>observation</color>	
Wonder.
GQ41043077	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Curses	 it's a trap!
GQ41043078	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You serious!? They got us surrounded!
GQ41043079	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	No choice but to smash through 'em now!
GQ41043080	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Alright! We did it!
GQ41043081	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Wonder! Shall we open that <color=#FF423F>treasure
chest</color> now?
GQ41043082	Armored Soldier	Stop! You're the intruders	 aren't you!?
GQ41043083	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh crap	 Shadows!
Was that a trap!?
GQ41043084	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The door is blocked by
a <color=#FF423F>grate</color>...
GQ41043085	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can use the same method to lift this <color=#FF423F>grate</color>
as we did the last one	 Wonder.
GQ41043087	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent work	 Wonder!
GQ41043088	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? The heck is this?
GQ41043089	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	This door looks weird as hell	 right?
Look at all those 
hains.
GQ41043090	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There could be many treasures in there.
GQ41043091	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I don't see a way to remove the <color=#FF423F>lock</color> on
those chains...
GQ41043092	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps there's a <color=#FF423F>key</color> somewhere? Let's search
for one	 Wonder.
GQ41043094	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 one key obtained!
GQ41043095	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The grate is out of the way now	 Wonder.
Let's go through.
GQ41043096	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Somethin' feels different about this room...
GQ41043097	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 look at that!
GQ41043098	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I knew it! There's a <color=#FF423F>treasure chest</color> in here!
GQ41043099	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	But it's guarded by Shadows...
GQ41043100	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll have to remove the Shadows first	 then.
Let's get to it	 Wonder!
GQ41043101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nicely done	 Wonder.
Well then	 let's see what's inside.
GQ41043102	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Aw yeah	 here we go!
GQ41043103	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Get your butts back in gear and go!
GQ41043104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take the lead	 Wonder.
GQ41052001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The mechanism is locked.
Seems we can't get in right now.
GQ41052002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 go take out that <color=#FF423F>Shadow</color> and get
the key.
GQ41052003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like we can get through here!
GQ41052004	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Let's keep it up	 everybody!
GQ41052005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 the grate blocking the door is open.
GQ41052006	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	With the fire out	 we can open the treasure
chest up there now!
GQ41052007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 look out!
The fire is still burning here!
GQ41052008	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	The Shadow dropped a key... Say	 ain't this
a dungeon key?
GQ41052009	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	They said they'd caught a girl	 too...
It might be Panther!
GQ41052010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really!? We'd better go save her
right away	 then!
GQ41052011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is this... a treasure chest key?
GQ41052012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent. Let's go claim some riches!
GQ41052013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I hear Shadows speaking up ahead.
We may have to fight if we continue forward.
GQ4105201302	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we <color=#FF423F>enter</color>	 Wonder?
GQ41052014	Choices	Let's go in.|Not now.
GQ41033021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we use this	 we may be able to get
all the way over there!
GQ41033022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's take a look at the mechanism.
GQ41033023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My word! That path lead to a place like this?
GQ41033024	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I knew there was a hidden passage here!
GQ41033026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's get on that elevator and go down to the
<color=#FF423F>lower level of the tower</color>.
GQ41033027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm	 this room has a strange mechanism...
GQ41033028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't yet predict what it might do.
Let's explore with caution.
GQ41033030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Blast it... The floor is rising!
GQ41033031	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What a layout...
Sure looks a lot like Kamoshida's Palace.
GQ41033032	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Especially this <color=#FF423F>portrait</color>...
GQ41033033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>portrait</color> stands out to me as well...
Wonder	 let's take closer look.
GQ41033034	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	If we can't go through here	 we'll have to go
and search someplace else.
GQ41033035	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Someplace else? Like where	 the west
building?
GQ41033036	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I guess we might as well head back	 then.
GQ41033037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch... There's a Shadow guarding that
treasure chest...
GQ41033038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need to fight it if we want the spoils.
GQ41033039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's go	 Wonder!
GQ41142043	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 would you care to do the honors?
GQ41142045	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Try listening to what that Shadow is saying	 Wonder.
GQ41142046	Armored Soldier	You gotta give this your all...
GQ41142047	Armored Soldier	This is an <color=#FF423F>important book</color>... Gotta
protect it.
GQ41142048	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hmm... Important <color=#FF423F>books</color>?
GQ41142049	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh	 he's the kinda guy that's always talking to
himself when he's doing stuff? I do that.
GQ41142050	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Although to me	 it sounds like he's
practically begging us to come steal the book
right now.
GQ41142051	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Exactly. That's what us Phantom Thieves do.
GQ41142052	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That <color=#FF423F>important book</color> is ours for the taking!
GQ41142053	Armored Soldier	Huh!? Hold on	 you must be intruders!
GQ41142054	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've been noticed. Let's go	 Wonder!
GQ41142055	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This is what that guard just now must have been trying to protect.
GQ41142056	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Wait... The "Book of Domination"?
GQ41142057	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The name sounds familiar somehow...
GQ41142058	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That puts all three books in our possession.
GQ41142059	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That sure was a lotta work for
three shabby books...
GQ41142060	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	It's probably because of how close we are
to the core.
GQ41142061	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	There are more Shadows around	
and thedistortions are getting much worse...
GQ41142062	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 this is the last area	 then...
Better steel ourselves for the last stretch!
GQ41142063	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All that's left is to solve the mechanism inside the bookshelves.
GQ41142064	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Would you like to head straight back there now	 Wonder?
GQ41142066	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 the bookshelf moved by itself! It's
like we're in a detective novel or something!
GQ41142067	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There appears to be a room ahead.
GQ41142068	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Our last ball's probably in there! C'mon	
let's go get it!
GQ41142069	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah... So that's how it's going to be.
GQ41142070	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Eh	 I guess this much was to be expected.
GQ41142071	Catcher	This is as far as you go	 filthy intruders!
GQ41142072	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Here they come! Prepare yourselves!
GQ41142074	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	That's the third one! We did it!
GQ41142075	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 this should be able to stop that scythe.
GQ41142076	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Alright	 let's head back there!
GQ41142077	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's begin by scouring this library.
GQ41142078	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	How about we head to the library first?
GQ41142079	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Palace libraries usually have some kind of
secret hiding inside them.
GQ41142081	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Weeell	 back when we were at Kamoshida's Palace	 some of the books we needed weren't in the same room.
GQ41142082	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very good! It seems you got it right!
GQ41142083	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are more of these mechanisms around
here. Stay calm and deal with them
one at a time.
GQ41142084	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I don't think there are any more books in this
area. Let's go somewhere else!
GQ41142085	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A Shadow is near! Stay vigilant	 Wonder!
GQ41142086	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keep your distance and try to avoid combat.
GQ41142087	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	This hall's more like a tunnel...
GQ41142088	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll have to deal with this area before we
can find the last ball.
GQ41142089	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yellow and green boxes	 huh.
GQ41142090	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I imagine moving the <color=#FF423F>right colors</color> to the
<color=#FF423F>right locations</color> will cause something
to occur.
GQ41142091	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Observe them carefully	 and see what happens.
GQ41142092	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The green boxes disappeared and the yellow ones fell down!
GQ41142095	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very well	 then. We'll return to the library.
GQ41142097	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Exactly. It was a huge pain going around
looking for them!
GQ41142098	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In that case	 let us search this place for
those books as well.
GQ41142099	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I see.... So that means we might have to
extend our search beyond here?
GQ41142100	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Nice! The other grate closed	 too!
GQ41142101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good work	 Wonder. Now we can investigate
this area.
GQLD2Final	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's the last Shadow. Now we can get the
information we need.
GQLD2Shouji01	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seem to be other anniversary albums.
Shall we keep searching?
GQLD2Shouji02	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's all the anniversary albums here...
GQLD2Shouji03	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are anniversary albums here. We need to
search for them.
GQLD2JiGuan001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	These ducts are tighter than I expected...
GQLD2JiGuan002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see	 we can get in this way! Very clever!
GQLD2JiGuan003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears we can get through now.
GQLD2JiGuan004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Wonder. Now let's check behind
the painting.
GQLD2JiGuan006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It looks like some of the sensors are
deactivated. We may be able to proceed.
GQLD2JiGuan007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Wonder.
GQLD2JiGuan008	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Brilliantly executed.
GQLD2JiGuan009	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You were great!
GQLD2JiGuan010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems you need a module to use the camera.
Let's find one.
GQ42071001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Those red lasers are all over the place. How
are we supposed to get through?
GQ42071002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You should know by now there is always a way
to unlock these things. Let's investigate
thoroughly.
GQLD2Battle01	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shadows ahead of us. It doesn't seem like
we'll be able to avoid them.
GQLD2Battle02	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 prepare for battle!
GQLD2JDWM02	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm. I can't say where exactly	 but I sense
another treasure chest around here...
GQLD2JDWM03	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are we done investigating here?
GQLD2JDYM02	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we've collected all the treasure here.
GQLD2JDYM03	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we open the final chest	 Wonder?
GQ42041001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need a password. Let's search some of
the nearby Shadows for it.
GQYHCOLL01	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wh... What is that!? Is it... a human?
GQYHCOLL02	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't detect any distortion nearby...
GQYHCOLL03	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps there are other distorted humanoids
like this one in the nearby area...
GQYHDEADEND	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We won't be able to force our way in.
We'll have to find another way.
GQYHJJDGG01	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agh... They've found us!
GQYHJJDGG02	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll be surrounded by Shadows at this rate!
We ought to pull back for now!
GQ42172001	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	As with other Palaces	 there's a good chance
the guards will have what we're looking for.
GQ42172003	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wha...!? A drawer just popped out of
the wall!
GQ42172004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... This is good for us. We can use
this as a pathway.
GQ42181018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There's a Shadow over there. But something
about it seems different from the others...
GQ42181001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. I have a feeling this will not be
so simple after all.
GQ42181002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take some time to prepare before we
engage in combat.
GQ42191001	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A treasure chest appeared!
That must mean we beat this area	 right?
GQ42191002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears so. We should return to
the vault's entrance as soon as we check its
contents. Is that acceptable?
GQ42191004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good. Once you get the treasure	
let's return to the bank entrance.
GQ42201002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The elevator past here seems to be connected
to the bank's deepest levels.
GQ42201003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're finally nearing the core...
GQ42201004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I doubt we'll be able to return once we board
the elevator. Are you ready to go?
GQ42201006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Where do you think you're going	 Wonder?
The core is right in front of your eyes.
GQ42182001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That painting's huge... Think we can get
through this one	 too?
GQ42182002	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	No... If my understanding is correct	 we will
not pass through it	 but in fact enter the
painting itself.
GQ42182003	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hoohoo... That is rather curious indeed!
Although I'm also quite interested in those
two empty frames over there...
GQ42182004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is no point in stopping here. Let's
keep going	 Wonder.
GQ42081001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ah	 a treasure chest key.
GQ42081002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. There must be a locked treasure chest
somewhere. Let's search for it.
GQ42081003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait there	 Wonder. It seems there may be
something around this painting...
GQ42081004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Shall we try exiting the painting for now?
GQ42081005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we can even exit via this painting.
GQ42081006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's search outside around the painting.
GQ42011001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us begin by investigating the building
just ahead of here.
GQ42011002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There is no telling what sort of enemy could
appear. Stay cautious	 Wonder.
GQ42011004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It doesn't seem to be locked... Shall we
go inside?
GQ42021001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Apparently this is the "special exhibitions
room." We ought to begin by investigating
the other areas around here.
GQ42021002	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah	 let's do this.
GQ42021003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I remember this.
GQ42021004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's the camera from Miyazawa's Palace
doing here?
GQ42021005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And those samurai-lookin' Shadows are here	
too. Does this place have somethin' to do
with Miyazawa?
GQ42021006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's certainly possible	 but I can't say for
sure just yet... At any rate	 we should
investigate those cameras first.
GQ42021007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears as though another exhibition room
is hidden behind this painting.
GQ42021008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us press onward.
Stay vigilant	 Wonder.
GQ42021009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's some sort of switch
here. I'm not sure what it does	
but should I press it?
GQ42021010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo! The shutters over there opened.
GQ42021011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I feel as though something is
approaching us...
GQ42021012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch... The Shadows spotted us! Everyone	
get ready!
GQ42021013	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hold on... Isn't that the treasure chest from
Miyazawa's Palace?
GQ42021014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It certainly does look identical. As I
suspected	 this place does have some
connection to Miyazawa...
GQ42021015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In any case	 we can think about it later.
Let's see what's inside	 Wonder.
GQ42021016	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This stuff seems pretty normal...
GQ42021017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. There may be similar treasure chests
elsewhere	 though. Let's look around.
GQ42031001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Next is the First Exhibition Room... Let's
start our search from the first floor	 then.
GQ42031002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be a path that leads elsewhere.
GQ42031003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 Wonder.
GQ42031004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These are... infrared sensor beams	 it would
seem. Touching them will likely alert the
guards to our presence.
GQ42031005	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	So how should we proceed? There does not
seem to be any way around them...
GQ42031006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps we can disable them somehow. Let's
take a look around.
GQ42031007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The device has been switched off. We can
pass through safely now.
GQ42031008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's go further in	 Wonder.
GQ42031009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The sensors are disabled. We can proceed
onwards now.
GQ42031010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent work	 Wonder.
GQ42031011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... You are now quite adept at this.
GQ42031012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There should be one more switch nearby.
See if you can find it.
GQ42031013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now all the infrared devices should be off.
Well done	 Wonder.
GQ42031014	Security Guard Shadow	Who are you!?
GQ42031015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Seems there are still some
enemies left.
GQ42031016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Quite a bother... Let's settle this quickly	
Wonder!
GQ42031017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems another treasure chest
has appeared.
GQ42031018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We ought to check it out	 Wonder.
GQ42041000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This appears to be an exhibition room
on the second floor of the museum...
GQ42041002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We ought to begin by searching the area.
GQ42041003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So this is the security room. We should look
around.
GQ42041004	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I found a laptop. It looks like it's got stuff about
the security system.
GQ42041005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Perhaps we can disable the infrared
sensors with this.
GQ42041006	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Let me see... Yeah	 this should work. We'll
need a password.
GQ42041007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A nearby Shadow may have it. Let's get going.
GQ42041008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should search for the password in the
nearby vicinity.
GQ42041011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... To think there would be a switch
hidden here.
GQ42041012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like the device is lowering.
GQ42041014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's a Shadow over there...
GQ42041015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They may have the password. Let's go	 Wonder!
GQ42041016	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hm? There's a note here.
It's got some numbers written on it.
GQ42041017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! Just as I thought. It may be the
elusive password.
GQ42041018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's quickly return to the security room and
test it.
GQ42041019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's return to the security room.
GQ42041020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good	 let's give this a try!
GQ42041021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now all the infrared devices should be off.
Well done	 Wonder.
GQ42041022	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Looks like it all worked out!
GQ42041023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's go further in	 Wonder.
GQ42041024	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What the hell!? A hole in the ground!?
GQ42041025	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Compose yourself. It isn't real. It's an
optical illusion.
GQ42041026	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Great... All the exits are blocked off. This
time it's electricity instead of infrared
lasers.
GQ42041027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That complicates things... There must be a
switch to deactivate it somewhere.
GQ42041028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's search the area	 Wonder.
GQ42041029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 there's a switch here.
GQ42041031	Film Studio Ninja	How'd you get in here!?
GQ42041032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've been found! Prepare yourself	 Wonder!
GQ42041033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There appears to be a passage
behind the painting.
GQ42041034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's proceed. Stay vigilant	 Wonder.
GQ42041035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 the treasure chest has materialized!
GQ42051001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This place is a bit excessive... It certainly
is a likely place for treasure.
GQ42051002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... A thrilling undertaking for phantom
thieves. Let's go	 Wonder!
GQ42051003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that this door won't open.
GQ42051004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We must find another way in. Let's search the
vicinity.
GQ42051005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We're kinda high up... One wrong move and
you're done for.
GQ42051006	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Well	 looks like we need to go higher.
Everyone	 watch your step!
GQ42051007	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 there's an open window. Maybe we can
get in from there?
GQ42051008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What shall we do	 Wonder? Should we enter
from here?
GQ42061001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense the Core in that direction...
GQ42061002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We need to investigate the area to proceed
further.
GQ42061003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are many Shadows roaming about. Let's
proceed with caution.
GQ42071005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This appears to be some sort of lounge.
GQ42071006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're still quite far from the Core. We have
further yet to go.
GQ42071003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This painting smells rather peculiar.
GQ42071004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Try using that camera over there. Perhaps the
new perspective will reveal something of
import.
GQ42081013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're getting closer to the Core.
GQ42081014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We may uncover an exit to the lounge if we
search the vicinity.
GQ42081015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a perfect location for an ambush...
GQ42081016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Show them what you got. Finish them off with
that phantom thief flair!
GQ42081007	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh? Aren't we just back where we came?
GQ42081008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems so. We must have taken a wrong turn.
GQ42081009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's try another route	 Wonder.
GQ42081010	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	A new painting has appeared in the frame.
GQ42081011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! A new route awaits.
GQ42081012	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Good. Let's get back to that first painting.
GQ42091001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears to be a gallery. The exit
continues to elude us...
GQ42091002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense a large number of Shadows ahead.
Don't let your guard down.
GQ42111001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's begin by searching the hall	 Wonder.
GQ42111002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just don't let your guard down.
GQ42111003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seems to be something nearby... It may
be worthwhile to search the area.
GQ42111004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears there's a surveillance room ahead.
Lead the way	 Wonder.
GQ42111005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense Shadows inside...
GQ42111006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait! There's something there!
GQ42111008	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Seems kinda violent... It's not gonna start
snapping at us	 is it?
GQ42111009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A bit of caution never hurt anyone. Let's be
careful here	 Wonder.
GQ42111010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll proceed once we're ready.
GQ42121001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agh... The hallway is being blocked by this
shutter. Could there be some way of
opening it?
GQ42121003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The shutter over there seems to have opened.
GQ42121004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We ought to hurry over.
GQ42121005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll aim for the north side of the hall's
first floor. Move out once you're ready.
GQ42121007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like a dead end...
GQ42121008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be some way forward. Let's look
around a bit.
GQ42121009	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's so stuffy in here! Feels as though I'll
run into a spider web at any moment...
GQ42121011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're finally out...
What a long duct that was.
GQ42121012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like the reception room.
GQ42121013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears as though the reception room's
shutter has been locked.
GQ42121014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need to find some way of unlocking it.
Could there be a hint nearby?
GQ42121015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo... The shutter opened!
Well done	 Wonder!
GQ42121016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... All of the rooms have been locked.
GQ42121017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's survey the area to see if we can find
a switch like the one just now.
GQ42121018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 the shutter over there just opened!
GQ42121019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Time to search the other rooms	 Wonder.
GQ42121020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems the shutter over there has opened.
GQ42121021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm... This room seems to be laid out
in the same way.
GQ42121022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another shutter opened	 Wonder!
GQ42121023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd say we have the hang of this now.
GQ42121025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I understand your awe	 but this is all
counterfeit.
GQ42121026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No amount of staring will make it real.
GQ42131001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think we've fully scoured the hall. Where
haven't we searched...?
GQ42131003	Bank Security Chief	Be on the alert for intruders! Keep those
elevators guarded!
GQ42131004	Bank Security Guard	Yes sir!
GQ42131005	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Agh	 really!? The elevator just went down!
GQ42131006	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	We were just a little too slow... We're going
to have to find the device that
controls the elevators now.
GQ42131007	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Sure	 but this area's crawling with Shadows.
We still gotta move carefully so
we're not spotted.
GQ42131008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm... It seems they've set traps along this
passage...
GQ42131009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 just look at that. It appears there are
two mechanisms over there.
GQ42131010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Likely the type solved by pushing boxes
around. The rest is up to you	 Wonder.
GQ42131011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent job	 Wonder. Let's continue our
investigation!
GQ42131012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Could this be the elevator control room?
Let's see if we can find some sort of
switch nearby.
GQ42131013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The elevator returned to the first floor!
GQ42131014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This should allow us access to the basement.
Let us return to the elevator.
GQ42131015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's get ready to head to the lower level.
GQ42131016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Pressing this switch should allow us to go
down to the basement.
GQ42131017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Enemies may be awaiting us down there.
Are you prepared	 Wonder?
GQ42131019	Bank Security Chief	How'd you get in here!?
GQ42131020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's just as I thought... Let's make quick
work of them	 Wonder!
GQ42141001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait. I sense an ominous presence ahead.
GQ42141002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you prepared	 Wonder?
GQ42141003	Choices	Open the door|Come back later
GQ42141004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm... This underground area seems even
larger than I imagined.
GQ42141005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Searching it will be quite arduous. Let's
begin by checking the area around us.
GQ42141006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense more Shadows ahead. Exercise proper
caution.
GQ42141008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah! That's...!
GQ42141010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You ought to be able to judge the cameras'
field of view	 Wonder.
GQ42141011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let us proceed with caution.
GQ42141014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What sort of machine is this...
Let's take a look.
GQ42141015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	One moment	 Wonder. Let's take a look
at the device over there first.
GQ42141016	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Is this the power source
for some kind of device?
GQ42141017	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	It says "camera" on it...
Couldn't this be the power source
for the surveillance cameras?
GQ42141018	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	For real!? Then let's smash it up already!
GQ42141019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That seems to have gone well.
GQ42141020	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Nice! We won't need to worry about any
security cameras now.
GQ42141021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A job well done	 Wonder!
GQ42141022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 we can't get through this way!
GQ42141023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We need to investigate first.
GQ42141024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remarkable dexterity	 Wonder.
GQ42141025	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	The path is blocked...
Shall we look for another way?
GQ42141027	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then what're we supposed to do?
GQ42141029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... That seems to be our only option.
GQ42141030	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Roger that. Then let's find these things
already.
GQ42141031	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay	 that's the last one!
GQ42141032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The security cameras have been neutralized.
Let's proceed	 Wonder.
GQ42141033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That Shadow over there...
GQ42141034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It may be holding onto the keycard.
Let's go!
GQ42141035	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Well that's sorted.
GQ42141036	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hm? That Shadow drop somethin'?
GQ42141037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A keycard. Just as I expected. We should
be able to use this somewhere nearby.
GQ42141038	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Is this the device? Let's give that keycard
a try.
GQ42141039	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It opened!
GQ42141040	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	It may even open other doors.
It seems well worth a try.
GQ42141041	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There's nothing scary about those
surveillance cameras now.
GQ42141042	G<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ard S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Looks like we have a rat infestation!
GQ42141043	G<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ard Shadow	This place is off-limits!
You require immediate removal!
GQ42141044	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's go	 Wonder!
GQ42141045	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... It seems a treasure chest
has appeared.
GQ42141046	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's make haste and examine its contents.
GQ42151001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The entrance to the security room appears to
be blocked.
GQ42151003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another search for a power source...
What a bothersome location.
GQ42151004	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No point in complaining about it.
Come on	 cheer up a little!
GQ42151005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 begin the investigation.
GQ42151006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's be careful to not be spotted
by any of the surveillance cameras.
GQ42151007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What splendid wirework!
GQ42151008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The path forward is utterly blocked...
GQ42151009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We'll need to disarm that trap.
Let's scout around this area.
GQ42151010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The trap's been disarmed	 then?
Impressive as always	 Wonder.
GQ42151011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like there are two rooms...
GQ42151012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The electrical box must surely be hidden
inside of here.
GQ42151013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That should have neutralized the fence.
GQ42151015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 let's depart as soon as you're ready.
GQ42161001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The floor is littered with bills...
GQ42161003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How overcome with desire is this Kaneshiro?
Nevermind. Heading underground comes first.
GQ42161004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another electric fence...? There may be some
hint about how to turn it off nearby.
GQ42161005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we've managed to render the fence
harmless. Excellent job	 Wonder.
GQ42161006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now let's push on... No	 wait.
GQ42161007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I curious as to what's on the other side
of that ventilation shaft. Why don't we try
taking a look?
GQ42161008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 it truly does feel like we'll find
something here.
GQ42161009	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? It's a dead end!
GQ42161010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There don't seem to be any other paths.
Perhaps there's a hint involving the
electrical box on the wall.
GQ42161011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take a look at it	 Wonder.
GQ42161012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are security cameras here.
We'll need to proceed with caution.
GQ42161013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent. We can utilize this duct
and continue our infiltration!
GQ42161014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo...! So you want to push through here.
You truly are the embodiment
of a Phantom Thief... Heh.
GQ42161015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... The security cameras here
seem different from ones we've encountered
thus far.
GQ42161016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't spot anything resembling
an electrical box nearby	 either.
GQ42161017	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're right. If I look closely	 though...
Something's blinking on and off	 right?
GQ42161018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Maybe the cameras can't see us when it's off?
GQ42161019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That seems quite likely.
Let us time our movements precisely
for when they are turned off.
GQ42161021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed... But there surely must be a way
in somewhere.
GQ42161022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's continue our search	 Wonder.
GQ42162001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see an elevator there	 but it's being
guarded by Shadows.
GQ42162003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I concur. Let's make our way there.
GQ42162004	Bank Security Guard	How'd you get here!? What were all the other
security guards doing!?
GQ42162005	Bank Security Guard	Leave this place! Now!
GQ42162006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems we have no choice but to fight.
Let's go	 Wonder!
GQ42162007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I imagine the security will only grow even
more thorough going forward. Be on high
alert as we continue.
GQ42172005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So this is the underground vault. I see
there are quite a lot of Shadows here.
GQ42172006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But where there is a vault	 there is
a treasure chest. It's our duty as Phantom
Thieves to push on.
GQ42172007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's begin by searching the first floor.
GQ42172008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right. Well done	 Wonder.
GQ42172010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... Yes	 that does make some sense.
We'll need to find and destroy those
as well.
GQ42172011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Something's suspicious about that room...
Won't you take a look	 Wonder?
GQ42172012	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? The door's not opening.
GQ42172029	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You kidding me? Man	 what a pain.
GQ42172016	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We did it! This should let us into the
room back there!
GQ42172017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. Let's return and give it a try.
GQ42172018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The electric fence and the security cameras
have been disabled. Well done	 Wonder.
GQ42172019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This area is crawling with Shadows. They
seem to be on rather high alert.
GQ42172020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think we ought to neutralize the security
first. Is there an electrical box nearby?
GQ42172021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The electrical box seems to be above us.
GQ42172022	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 we've taken out the security
system. We should be able to
proceed now.
GQ42172023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's start by going deeper and searching
the area	 Wonder.
GQ42172024	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ugh... Our way through is blocked.
GQ42172025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be some way to disarm the trap.
Let's start by taking a close look at the
room over there.
GQ42172026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That seems to have gone well. I imagine
there are other similar devices.
GQ42172028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... All the traps in this area should be
disarmed now. Well done.
GQ42181003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's keep searching the vault's second floor	
Wonder.
GQ42181006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Just look at how high up we are...
Better make sure not to fall.
GQ42181007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another electric fence? How gauche. Let's
destroy the nearby electrical box.
GQ42181008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hold on. There seems to be a powerful
Shadow just beyond this door.
GQ42181009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What shall we do	 Wonder? Would you like
to push on?
GQ42181013	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Come on! More traps? Just how heavily
guarded is this place anyway?
GQ42181014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's only natural for the security to grow
heavier the further we go. But we must
push on.
GQ42181015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You know the drill. We'll search the area
and keep our eyes peeled for any hints.
GQ42181016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Excellent job.
GQ42181017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now we can proceed. Well done	 Wonder.
GQ42181010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Splendidly done	 Wonder! We've neutralized
all the traps and security cameras now.
GQ42191007	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Look at all those shelves... I feel like
I'm gonna be dizzy.
GQ42191005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We seem to be on the lowest floor.
Stay focused	 Wonder.
GQ42191008	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Just how long is this thing going to go
on for...?
GQ42191009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We destroyed the electrical box	 but...
GQ42191010	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Looks like our way's still blocked.
GQ42191011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There must be more boxes. In that case	
let's find and destroy them all.
GQ42191013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That must have been the final
electrical box.
GQ42191014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We've disarmed all the traps with that.
Are you prepared to move ahead?
GQ42191015	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's go back to the room just now if
you're ready!
GQ42191016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Wonder.
GQ42191017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But the job's not over quite yet. Let's find
the next electrical box.
GQ42191018	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That Shadow seems pretty tough...
GQ42191019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's guarding the deepest part of the vault.
We ought to assume that it's quite powerful.
GQ42191021	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I sure am! C'mon	 let's do this!
GQ42191022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There it is! Found the electrical box!
GQ42191024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're up	 Wonder. You should be able to
avoid it all.
GQ42191025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Our path's been blocked	 has it? We'll need
to head over there for now to disarm
the traps.
GQ42191026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Search the area for a way forward.
GQ42191027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well done	 Wonder. All that's left now is to
destroy the electrical box.

GQ30001001	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	All righty then	 viewers. Allow me to
introduce the next game!
GQ30001002	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	First up is the heart of the challenger
team	 Kiiiiing Robooo!
GQ30001003	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	King Robo is what you would call
a master hacker!
GQ30001004	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	If our challenger can safely guide King
Robo to the hacking site	 he wins!
GQ30001005	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	What do you say? Are you ready? Then let the
games... BEGIN!
GQ30001006	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Oh my... It looks like an obstacle is
blocking the way!
GQ30001007	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	The one thing every hacker dreads...
An impenetrable firewall!
GQ30001008	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Whatever will our challenger do!? Only one
way to find out!
GQ30001009	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	What's this!? Yet another obstacle has
appeared? An electric barrier	 no less?
GQ30001010	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	But it looks like our challenger has their
own new gadget! A Self-Destruct Bot!
GQ30001011	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	It may be small	 but it packs some serious
firepower! Enough to blow up those barriers!
GQ30001012	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	However	 each time you use one gives you
that much less to work with	 so use
them wisely!
GQ30001013	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	What do you think	 folks? Can our challenger
rise to the occasion?
GQ30001014	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Uh oh! This new robot looks like a doozy!
GQ30001015	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? A robot that attacks
other robots!? I believe this is what we call
a Berserk Bot!
GQ30001016	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	With these Berserk Bots on the scene	 a
fiery Robo battle is about to unfold! I'm
on the edge of my seat	 folks!
GQ30001017	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Will our challenger ride the tide of battle
or sink under pressure!? Stay tuned to
find out!
GQ30001018	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	And it's yet another Electric Barrier Door!
Time to use a Self-Destruct Bot to...
Wait	 it's gone!?
GQ30001019	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	The challenger seems to be in trouble... But
not to worry! I thought this might happen	
which is why I've arranged for a Secret Switch!
GQ30001020	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	The challenger just has to move the robot on
top of the Secret Switch	 and...!
The barrier is no more!
GQ30001021	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Nice and easy	 huh? BZZT! You must
be dreaming!
GQ30001022	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	The Berserk Bot will change routes now that
the barrier is down and the terrain has
changed! Keep a close eye on it!

GQ41092018	AAAAAA==	We took a break and recovered
our stamina...
GQ41121015	AAAAAA==	There's a strange <color=#FF423F>button</color>
hidden in the bookshelf...
I should try pressing it.
GQ41142001	AAAAAA==	I picked up the Book of

GQ41142014	AAAAAA==	I put the book I found

GQ41043054	AAAAAA==	We need to find a way into

GQ41043086	AAAAAA==	First we have to figure out

GQ41043093	AAAAAA==	I need to find a <color=#FF423F>key</color> to
remove those chains first...
GQ41043105	AAAAAA==	I should come back

GQ41033025	AAAAAA==	We can get to the <color=#FF423F>lower level

GQ41142042	AAAAAA==	We have all the books for each

GQ41142065	AAAAAA==	I put the book I found

GQ41142094	AAAAAA==	Let's.|Say no more.
GQ41142096	AAAAAA==	We're back in the library...
Let's try searching again...
GQLD2JiGuan005	AAAAAA==	We all worked together
to remove the painting...
GQLD2JDWM01	AAAAAA==	If I open this chest	 that
will end our investigation of
this area...
GQLD2JDWM04	AAAAAA==	Let's keep looking.|We're done here.
GQLD2JDYM01	AAAAAA==	If I open this chest	 that

GQLD2JDYM04	AAAAAA==	Let's open it.|I have things left to do.
GQ42172002	AAAAAA==	I got the <color=#FF423F>Vault KeyCard</color>...
GQ42191003	AAAAAA==	Sounds good.|Let's hurry back.
GQ42201001	AAAAAA==	We're back at the vault
entrance...
GQ42201005	AAAAAA==	Let's move.|Let me prepare a bit.
GQ42011003	AAAAAA==	I think I can go in from here.
GQ42041009	AAAAAA==	There's a space between
the painting and the wall...
GQ42041010	AAAAAA==	Let's check behind here...
GQ42041013	AAAAAA==	There might be a switch over there. Let's
go have a look.
GQ42041030	AAAAAA==	Press it|Press it later
GQ42041036	AAAAAA==	Seems like some sort
of switch...
GQ42041037	AAAAAA==	Let's press it...
GQ42051009	AAAAAA==	Go in|Come back later
GQ42111007	AAAAAA==	A Shadow in the shape of a dog...?
Could it be the guard dog here?
GQ42111011	AAAAAA==	Open the door|Come back later
GQ42121002	AAAAAA==	Maybe if we used the computer in the
surveillance room?
GQ42121006	AAAAAA==	Yes	 let's start searching the first floor.
GQ42121010	AAAAAA==	I understand how you feel	 but you'll need
to persevere if you wish to continue being
a Phantom Thief.
GQ42121024	AAAAAA==	There's a mountain of cash
sitting on the table...
GQ42131002	AAAAAA==	I don't think we've checked the basement yet.
Let's look for a way down there.
GQ42131018	AAAAAA==	Press the button|Take more time to prepare
GQ42141007	AAAAAA==	It's not opening... It seems we'll need some
sort of key.
GQ42141009	AAAAAA==	Looks like a security camera.
The enemies will have their guard up
if we're spotted on that thing.
GQ42141012	AAAAAA==	What does this do...?
GQ42141013	AAAAAA==	What is it	 Wonder?
GQ42141026	AAAAAA==	The cameras are watching our every move. We
shouldn't make any unwise movements.
GQ42141028	AAAAAA==	I say we destroy their power source like
before to take out the cameras.
GQ42151002	AAAAAA==	Yeah... We gotta do something about that
fence. The power source must be somewhere
around here.
GQ42151014	AAAAAA==	Yes	 we can finally enter the security room
at long last.
GQ42161002	AAAAAA==	This is just like Kaneshiro's palace. All of
it must have been stolen from the helpless.
GQ42161020	AAAAAA==	I don't see a way for us to go underground.
GQ42162002	AAAAAA==	That just shows how important it is. I bet
we can make it underground if we take it.
GQ42172009	AAAAAA==	Seems like that's not all of the cameras and
electric fences	 though. Couldn't there be
other electrical boxes around?
GQ42172013	AAAAAA==	Seems that way. Maybe we need a
different keycard?
GQ42172015	AAAAAA==	I got the Safe Keycard...
GQ42172027	AAAAAA==	The room over there seems fishy to me.
Let's go over there.
GQ42181004	AAAAAA==	We're going to the vault's
second floor. There are three
floors total	 it seems...
GQ42181005	AAAAAA==	It doesn't seem to open from
this side...
GQ42181012	AAAAAA==	Keep going.|Give me a bit more time.
GQ42181011	AAAAAA==	Look at all those blinking security cameras.
We need to find the perfect moment
to dash across.
GQ42191006	AAAAAA==	We made it to the
bottom floor...
GQ42191012	AAAAAA==	It doesn't seem to open
from this side.
GQ42191020	AAAAAA==	Doesn't seem like this is going to be an easy
fight... Is everyone ready?
GQ42191023	AAAAAA==	Making it there won't be easy	 though.

LD00001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? Where are we?
LD00002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A... palace?
No	 wait a second...
LD00003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense a presence similar to a Palace
up ahead	 but something's... off.
LD00005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As we discussed before	 Palaces are the
manifestation of a person's warped
desires.
LD00006	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But further ahead	 the warped desires
I'm sensing lack a human's willpower...
LD00007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As far as I know	 this is the first time
I've encountered anything like it.
LD00008	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm not sure what it could be	 but it's
worth investigating.
LD00009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you think	 Wonder?
LD00011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh? Very well. Then once you've
prepared	 let us head that way.
LD00021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Tch... They have us surrounded! There's
too many. We must retreat at once...
LD00022	Emot<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>onal Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Oh my... What do we have here?
I must be seeing things. Is that a
human challenger!?
LD00023	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>otional S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Say hello to your fabulous producer	
Besa! So glad you made it all this way.
LD00024	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	The show's about to heat up!
Places	 everyone! I want pictures
up in five!
LD00025	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Human	 we're delighted to have you
onboard. We hope you enjoy the Robo
Challenge at full throttle!
LD00026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose we're challengers	 then?
More importantly...
LD00027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't sense one bit of hostility from
them. This is quite the conundrum.
LD00028	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	Is the stage all set? Everyone	 one last
check before showtime!
LD00029	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	If we're all set	 let's get those cameras
rolling! The show's about to begin!
LD00030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears that talking Shadow calls the
shots around here.
LD00032	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We discussed this before	 remember?
Much of the true nature of Shadows
remains a mystery.
LD00033	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Like Marthym	 there appear to be some
Shadows that are quite fond of humans.
LD00034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And this space... I initially thought it
was a Palace that resembled a TV
broadcasting studio	 but...
LD00035	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems it is not that simple. I don't
sense a single treasure in the area.
LD00036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Honestly	 the situation is most
perplexing. However	 what I do
know is...
LD00037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That they've welcomed us as their
challengers with open arms.
LD00038	B<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sa	All right	 challengers!
Please take the stage!
LD00039	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we refuse their invitation	 the
Shadows around us may react
violently.
LD00040	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For the time being	 it's best we play
along. I'm counting on you	 Wonder.
LD00050	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Can I talk to you for a moment?
LD00051	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The truth is	 Mementos has been quite strange
as of late.
LD00052	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you have time	 I'd like you to take a
look. I believe at least a cursory
investigation would be prudent.
LD00053	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It may turn out to be nothing at all	 but...
if something were to happen	 we best
be prepared.
LD00070	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is... Hoom	 it seems my intuition was
not misguided after all.
LD00072	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If my evaluation is correct	 then this is...
LD00073	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A gathering place	 for the Shadows of
lost humans.
LD00075	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In fact	 there has been a slight change in
the voices I hear calling out from
within Mementos.
LD00076	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As a consequence of their desires being
stolen	 they feel befuddled by the choices
they make each day	 major and minor...
LD00077	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I heard increasing voices saying they were
stagnating and unable to move forward.
LD00078	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They feel anxious that if things continue as
they are	 they will not be able to survive
in modern society...
LD00079	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 their cognition has resulted in
the creation of this gathering place.
LD00081	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we leave things as they are	 this space
will eventually overtake all of Mementos...
LD00082	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which	 in turn	 would have disastrous
consequences on reality.
LD00083	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 before that happens	 we must prevent
this place from expanding.
LD00085	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Inside this space	 just like a Palace	 there
are powerful Shadows holding
distorted desires.
LD00086	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	These are the Shadows of humans who have
lost their way and cannot choose a
path forward.
LD00087	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we can aid them in making their choices	
they may be able to find their way again...
LD00088	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That way	 the Shadows will be able to return
to their human selves.
LD00089	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And consequently	 this space should also
cease expansion.
LD00091	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... But before we enter	 a word
of advice.
LD00092	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Although this is a special space	 make no
mistake	 it is still part of Mementos.
LD00093	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which means we may have no choice but to
fight against some unusual Shadows.
LD00094	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't believe you have anything to worry
about	 but still... I would advise caution.
LD00108	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	AAAAAA==
LD00101	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 we're heading into the Metaverse to
infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today	 right?
LD00102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed we are. You've both become much
stronger	 so I'm confident we'll have that
Treasure soon.
LD00103	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really? Hah	 good to hear!
LD00104	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I gotta hurry up and find it... for Tomoko's
sake too!
LD00105	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm ready to go whenever you are. Why don't
we drop by Mementos first?
LD00106	Meta<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>erse Navigator	*vzzt*
LD00120	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hold on	 this doesn't look like Mementos.
LD00121	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uhh	 Lufel? Where exactly are we?
LD00122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've hardly a clue myself. It's my first time
here as well. It's certainly the Metaverse...
LD00124	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A castle? What's something like that
doing here!? Doesn't look like it's
Kiuchi's Palace...
LD00125	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That big banner hanging there looks new
to me too.
LD00126	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This may be a space in the Metaverse
heretofore unknown to us.
LD00127	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know	 right? Feels like something you'd
see at a school.
LD00128	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know	 like the ones saying	 "Congrats
on making nationals!" or whatever.
LD00129	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. I thought at first that Kiuchi's
Palace may have changed	 but no...
LD00130	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wherever we may be	 vigilance is of
utmost importance. Danger is surely
afoot.
LD00131	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The fact that we arrived here in our
Phantom Thieves attire is proof that
we're unwelcome guests here.
LD00132	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 really!?
LD00133	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In that case	 shouldn't we get outta here?
LD00134	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	While this place piques my curiosity	 you may
be correct. Fortunately the exit is in sight‚Äî
LD00135	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Huh!?
LD00136	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We're unable to leave. Some odd force
seems to be at work.
LD00137	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What? No way... So you're telling me we're
trapped here!?
LD00138	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That appears to be the case. We have no
choice but to find another way to escape.
LD00140	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 seriously...?
LD00141	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can think of no other option myself. Let's
see if we can find an entrance.
LD00142	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense something similar to Treasure inside.
If this is somebody's Palace...
LD00143	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...pilfering whatever that something is
ought to allow us to escape.
LD00144	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sooo... I guess we could call it practice for
stealing Kiuchi's Treasure or something?
LD00145	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	In that case	 I'm in. A li'l practice drill
means less nerves when it matters	 too!
LD00146	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We are in unknown territory	 so we must
not let our guards down. Who can say if we'll
even be able to find a way inside...
LD00147	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Heeey! The door's open!
LD00149	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I find it hard to believe that a such
a highly fortified stronghold would just
welcome thieves inside.
LD00150	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps it is a sign that others have
infiltrated this place before us...
LD00151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Let's go	 Wonder. But of course	 do be
cautious.
LD00176	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ond-Haired Boy	Tch... This is bad!
LD00177	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Creature	Damn	 we let our guard down...
LD00170	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Hold on... Who's that!?
LD00171	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Other intruders? I knew it. They must have
been the ones to unlock the gate.
LD00172	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like one of them is human...
They're struggling against the Shadows too.
LD00173	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! Looks like we've got company!
LD00175	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 Closer is still inexperienced in battle.
Allow me to handle things here!
LD00190	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Creature	And who exactly are you!?
LD00191	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Creature	Another bad guy? No	 doesn't seem like it...
LD00192	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ond-Haired Boy	Oooh	 reinforcements!? Great timing!
LD00193	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ond-Haired Boy	Things were looking pretty dicey!
LD00210	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ond-Haired Boy	Hey man	 thanks! You saved our butts
there. I'm Ryuji Sakam‚Äî
LD00211	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Creature	What are you doing	 idiot? Why would you
give your real name to some total stranger!?
LD00212	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ond-Haired Boy	Huh? Oh	 yeah. Right. Just call me <color=#FF423F>Skull</color>!
LD00213	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That cat there's <color=#FF423F>Mona</color>.
LD00214	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I'm not a cat!
LD00215	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	And who are you?
LD00216	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Don't ignore me!
LD00217	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Wonder	 huh? You kinda remind me of
a friend of mine.
LD00218	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you okay	 Wonder!?
LD00219	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 that's one huge cat!
LD00220	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've never seen one this big...
LD00221	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Again	 I'm not a cat.
LD00222	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm. You didn't appear to be human from
afar	 and it seems I was correct.
LD00223	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hold up a sec! Who're you to talk? What
the hell're you supposed to be anyway!?
LD00224	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Are you like... a bug-eyed lemur or
something?
LD00225	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Who do you think you're calling a lemur!?
My name's Cattle!
LD00226	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't worry	 we've all been there. Even we
weren't sure what he was at first.
LD00227	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah	 it's not like I get what Mona is	
either. I guess some creatures naturally
have googly eyes.
LD00228	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What are you saying!? Don't you dare lump
me in with this guy!
LD00229	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Inexcusable... I can't believe you'd even
begin to think of me and that sorry excuse
for a cat as one and the same!
LD00231	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Nyahaha!
LD00232	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You've got some sharp eyes on you. Then
again	 I think you'll find the word "cool" is
more fitting.
LD00233	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I concur. Some may appear more on the
cute side when compared to my stately
appearance.
LD00234	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Where do you two get your confidence from...?
LD00235	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Cute	 you say? I take it you are trying to
flatter me. Very well	 you may hold me in
high esteem.
LD00236	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Yeah	 "cool" is the word that really
describes me! Of course cute isn't really me.
LD00237	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Really? You've got weird taste	 man.
I'll say that much.
LD00238	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I accept the flattery	 but I refuse to be
compared to the likes of him.
LD00239	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That's right! We're nothing alike! But...
thanks for the compliment.
LD00240	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Anyway	 enough about our weird friends...
LD00241	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	What are you guys doing here	 Wonder?
LD00242	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	As for us	 we got lost and just kinda ended
up in this place	 so...
LD00243	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hey! You're giving away too much info!
In case you haven't realized	 we've only
just met each other!
LD00244	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh c'mon	 relax. They were the ones who
saved our butts just now.
LD00245	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Well	 yes	 but...
LD00246	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We also somehow just ended up here. We're
looking for a way to escape.
LD00247	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hold on	 we can't be the only ones
sharing information here	 either.
LD00248	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think it's fine. We're in a tough spot	
anyway.
LD00249	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We might figure something out by talking
to these people... If they are both people.
LD00250	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What are you looking at me for?
LD00251	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... Very well	 then. It seems we are
both just as in the dark as each other.
LD00252	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 we were trying to get somewhere	
but then...
LD00253	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We suddenly wound up here somehow.
LD00254	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh! Same as us	 then.
LD00255	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Zip it	 Skull!
LD00256	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	What's the big deal? They're being open
with us.
LD00257	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So yeah	 we just came here outta nowhere
and entered the castle...
LD00258	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	...but we ended up duking it out with
Shadows and got split from our friends in
the chaos.
LD00259	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	There were others with you?
LD00260	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah	 two more. Just when we were about
to regroup	 we were surrounded by bad
guys again.
LD00261	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which is when we made our timely arrival.
LD00262	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ugh... Look at this guy	 running his mouth.
LD00263	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Fine. Guess we ought to tell you everything.
So we might've come here by accident	 but...
LD00264	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	...we do have an idea about how to get out.
LD00266	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mmhmm. I reckon this castle is hiding
something...
LD00267	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's some kind of Treasure here	 which
means securing it may be the key to our
escape.
LD00268	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hey	 you stole my line just now! What are
you interrupting me like that for!?
LD00269	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 it is the early bird that reaps the
worm.
LD00270	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hold on a second. So you guys know about
Treasure?
LD00271	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 that makes things simple. Plus	 we
know this castle's ruler.
LD00272	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That's means we know our way around to
some degree.
LD00273	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 that's convenient!
LD00274	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You'd think so	 but...
LD00275	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I don't think that jerk would allow anyone
to paint over his portrait like that...
LD00276	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That's right. This place may look like
<color=#FF423F>Kamoshida's</color> Palace	 but it sure isn't the
real deal.
LD00277	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 so you know about Palaces too! So	
you're saying this place...
LD00278	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	...is a lot like this Kamoshida guy's Palace	
but also has its differences?
LD00279	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Pretty much! You've got a good head on
your shoulders	 er.... Miss Yellow!
LD00280	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right	 I guess I never gave you my name.
I'm Motoh... Er	 Closer.
LD00281	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Closer	 Wonder	 and Cattle	 huh? Well	 that
gets the formalities out of the way!
LD00282	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And with that	 we have successfully given
away our code names and goals to complete
strangers...
LD00283	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Since we're all on the same page	 why don't
we go look for this Treasure-like thing
together?
LD00284	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you say	 Wonder? It sounds like they
still have two friends to find.
LD00286	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 nothing beats strength in numbers.
LD00287	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	True! Having more allies would sure help
us out	 too!
LD00288	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Cooperation	 huh? Nothing like a little
honor among thieves.
LD00289	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We'll tell you what we know about this
castle	 and you three can help us out in
battle!
LD00290	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Okay	 we have a deal! Let's work together
to achieve both our goals!
LD00291	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's a huge help	 thank you!
LD00292	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	By the way... You know how you just talked
about this "Treasure-like thing"?
LD00293	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I don't wanna have to keep calling it that.
How about we give it a name?
LD00294	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm for it	 but what would work?
LD00296	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed... In that case	 why don't we call it
a <color=#FF423F>Core</color>? For the time being	 at least.
LD00297	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Huh	 I was just about to say the same
thing! You're not bad	 lemur.
LD00298	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't want anyone calling me that	
especially not some fake feline!
LD00299	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Heh heh... Well	 I guess we have a name
for it! From now on	 it shall be known as
a Core!
LD00300	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We'll look for the Core while searching for
Skull and Mona's friends. Let's go!
LD00810	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I ran into some real trouble in the very
first hall at Kamoshida's Palace	 too.
LD00811	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Y'know	 the same spot you just helped
us out at.
LD00812	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do you mean	 real trouble?
LD00813	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Well	 we got surrounded by these armored
shadows and got the crap beat out of us.
LD00814	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh	 why!?
LD00815	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	We hadn't awakened our Personas at the
time	 so we just ended up getting hauled
away instead.
LD00816	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That bastard... Just thinking about it
pisses me off!
LD00817	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you've been through a lot	 too. You know	
at times like this	 I like to...
LD00819	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Those are both great ideas! Moving your
body does a lot to clear up your mind.
LD00820	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You... wanna work out?
LD00821	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I mean	 I get it	 but... I didn't expect you
guys to be jocks.
LD00822	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 I'll join you! Nothing like a stress
relief activity with friends!
LD00823	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh?
LD00824	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't worry	 you'll be fine. Just follow
my lead. When it comes to fitness	 I'm a pro!
LD00825	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But what can we do here... We might have
enough room for some quick sprints.
LD00826	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Don't I get a say in this?
LD00828	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I bet sprinting over there would really
take a load off your mind. C'mon!
LD00829	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*chuckle* I suppose we have no choice
but to run now.
LD00830	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I like Closer's attitude. C'mon	 Skull! Get
out there!
LD00831	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Gaaah! Easy for you to say when you're
not the ones running!
LD00832	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Okay	 Closer! If we're doing this	 there's
no way I'm losing!
LD00850	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I must say	 nothing about this castle is
remotely appealing.
LD00851	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Isn't a Palace like... a representation of
how its twisted ruler sees the world?
LD00852	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Come to think of it	 Kiuchi's Palace was
pretty odd too... it was a weird stadium.
LD00853	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. Other twisted desires must have
shaped this place into a similarly vulgar
state.
LD00854	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Judging by the awful stuff Kamoshida does
in reality	 I'd hate to even think what evil
desires inspired this...
LD00855	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This place is disgusting. I'd like to get
out of here ASAP.
LD00856	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh? Then do tell what your ideal Palace
would be like.
LD00857	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Well	 you see...
LD00858	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Let's see. A good palace would be...
something pretty... something cool...
with Lady Ann there too...
LD00859	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Now that's a plan!
LD00860	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What am I saying!? This is no time for
idle chat! We gotta hurry on ahead!
LD00861	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 you're not gonna finish the story?
LD00862	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Talk about avoiding the subject...
LD00880	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's way gloomier in here than it was in
Kiuchi's palace. It's like Shadows could
leap out from anywhere...
LD00881	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Man	 I wouldn't be surprised if we found
straight-up ghosts in this place...
LD00882	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Now that you mention it	 this does kind
of seem like one of those carnival
haunted houses...
LD00883	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	S-Stop it! I'm not good with spooky stuff...
LD00885	H<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>roto	AAAAAAAAAGH!
LD00886	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Enough of that infernal racket! We must
focus on the task at hand!
LD00887	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Did you hear me? I said to quiet down!
LD00888	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 that includes you! Phantom Thieves
are professionals at infiltration!
Yelling is...!
LD00320	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	<color=#FF423F>Panther</color>? Hey	 are you okay?
LD00321	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You got captured!?
LD00322	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Mona! Skull! You came for me!
LD00323	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I'm sorry	 those Shadows surrounded me and
took me away... Who are those guys?
LD00325	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Ah! Look out	 behind you!
LD00326	Warden	Hey! Just what do you think you're doing!?
LD00340	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Thanks for saving me!
LD00341	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Anyway	 where were we... Oh yeah. Who are
those people?
LD00343	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Huh! It feels weird to meet other phantom
thieves. It's reassuring to know that there
are more of us out there.
LD00344	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I'm Panther	 by the way. Nice to meet you!
LD00345	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Likewise!
LD00346	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I have to say	 though... What kind of awful
person puts a teenage girl in a place
like this!?
LD00347	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Heheh	 it is pretty awful	 but hey	 better
than being tied up and hurt	 I guess?
LD00348	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait. Has that... happened to you before?
LD00349	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah. It's a little complicated	 though...
LD00350	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I couldn't even begin to imagine what kinds
of complications would lead to that.
LD00351	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 hey. Is <color=#FF423F>Joker</color> not with you?
LD00352	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Yeah... we got split up.
LD00353	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Well	 I'm sure he'll be fine. Who knows	
maybe he's looking for us too.
LD00354	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mewhehee... Very true. I can't imagine
him just sitting still.
LD00355	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Is this Joker guy your other friend? He
must be really strong!
LD00356	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Strong? I dunno if I'd go that far...
Versatile	 maybe.
LD00357	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah	 he's someone you always end up
relying on. I guess you could call him
our leader.
LD00358	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 so then he's like Wonder!
LD00359	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	True! I get the vague feeling that the
two of you are alike.
LD00360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Does that mean that you often rely on
Wonder	 Closer?
LD00361	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Of course I do! I mean	 he's our leader!
LD00363	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Wow	 he even talks like Joker... Could you
two be twins or something?
LD00364	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Urgh	 just ignore this idiot. Still	 it would
be nice to find Joker already.
LD00365	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 don't call me that!
LD00366	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I gotta admit	 though	 it's hard to keep
my cool when he's not around...
LD00367	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Right	 we should go find him first and
then snatch the Core!
LD00900	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Man	 this place never fails to creep
me out...
LD00901	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Try being help captive there. It was so
damp and gross all around.
LD00902	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I guess Kamoshida wants to confine anyone
he doesn't like in a dark cell underground.
LD00903	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That guy's twisted view really shows in this
place.
LD00904	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah	 hard to believe just how many victims
he had... Ugh.
LD00905	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This Kamoshida fellow sounds like
a human with rather fine taste.
LD00906	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Fine taste...?
LD00907	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way! How could you ever say anything
remotely positive about that horrible fiend!?
LD00908	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Please. I was clearly being sardonic.
LD00909	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sardonic?
LD00910	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Sour tonic...?
LD00911	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Ooh	 are we talking about soda?
LD00912	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Argh	 is there anyone with a modicum of
intelligence here!?
LD00930	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Agh... I can't stand this place.
LD00931	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't tell me	 this was the place you were
tied up	 Panther?
LD00932	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	That's right! What's worse	 there was
another me here wearing a skimpy swimsuit...
LD00933	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You... in a swimsuit!?
LD00934	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Ugh... I get chills just thinking about it.
LD00935	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It must have been the form this Kamoshida
fellow saw as his ideal version of you.
LD00936	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Which is to say that he saw you in a similar
light in real life.
LD00937	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Gross! Oh my god	 he is the worst!
LD00938	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So he saw us boys as slaves... and you girls
as his little playthings.
LD00939	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Can you believe a piece of trash like that
works at a school!? Now it's our turn to
teach him a lesson!
LD00941	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Mmhm. We're gonna grab this guy's Treasure
and make him apologize for everything!
LD00942	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Ugh	 these goosebumps just aren't going
away... Mona	 let me get some floofy time in!
LD00943	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Huh? What're you talking about...
LD00944	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Wh-Wh-Whoooah! Puh-Puh-Panther!
You know we're in public	 right!?
LD00945	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ah	 but... I couldn't be any happier...
Mrrreow...
LD00946	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	At least all is well for the quasi-cat.
In any case	 it's time for us to depart.
LD00380	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	This place never stops being creepy	 huh?
Training Hall of Love my ass.
LD00382	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way... Look at those girls! Let's go
help them!
LD00383	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Calm down	 Closer. Those are cognitive
beings	 not real humans.
LD00384	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! Right	 Cattle told me about that. Still	
just seeing them is hard to take.
LD00385	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What sort of human desires would give rise
to such twisted cognition?
LD00386	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Like we were saying	 it'd be hard to find a
teacher more disgusting than Kamoshida.
LD00387	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	He takes the volleyball team members he
coaches and... Wait	 those girls...
LD00388	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	They're not from our volleyball team	 are
they?
LD00389	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait... No way! Tomoko!?
LD00390	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Tomoko! What's she doing there!?
LD00391	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Calm yourself. Did you not hear what Mona
just told you? Those are cognitive beings
who‚Äî
LD00392	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Even if she isn't real	 how could he do this
to her!?
LD00393	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Especially after the way she was hurt so
badly in real life...
LD00394	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Is she your friend	 Closer?
LD00395	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 we're super close. But... this Kiuchi
punk shoved her onto the train tracks.
LD00396	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She ended up getting seriously injured	 and
that's why she can no longer play baseball	
her favorite game...
LD00397	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's why I'm going to make sure that
Kiuchi has a change of heart!
LD00398	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hmm...
LD00399	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You know	 something awful happened to one
of my best friends too. It was all Kamoshida's
doing.
LD00400	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	That's why I'll do whatever it takes to make
him have a change of heart. For Shiho's sake!
LD00401	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Panther...
LD00402	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Let's both give this everything we have!
For our friends!
LD00403	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah! If these guys are rotten to the core...
We'll just have to cut that rot out!
LD00404	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	And if that's our plan	 the first thing we're
gonna have to do is find our way outta
this place.
LD00405	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	This doesn't seem to be Kamoshida's Palace	
but I doubt it's this Kiuchi guy's either.
LD00406	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But why would cognitive beings connected
to Kiuchi be in a place linked to Kamoshida?
LD00407	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Do you really expect me to know the
answer to that?
LD00408	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	If it's not Kamoshida's Palace	 and it's not
Kiuchi's either... then where are we?
LD00409	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems this is no time for us to
dilly-dally.
LD00410	Warden	Hey	 you! What are you doing!?
LD00420	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Agh! These are no simple foes!
LD00421	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What is with them? They're super tough!
LD00422	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh man	 I think I'm starting to feel woozy...
LD00423	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Dammit	 Mona! What are we gonna do!?
They'll just wear us down at this rate!
LD00424	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You say that like I'm not running out of
steam myself!
LD00426	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 no! These aren't opponents you
can fend off on your own‚Äî
LD00427	???	Allow me to lend a hand!
LD00428	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Wait... Joker!?
LD00429	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? That's him!?
LD00431	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Think you can handle it?
LD00433	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Heh... Okay	 let's go!
LD00440	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Follow my lead!
LD00460	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa... You really beat them! It's like you
two were reading each other's minds!
LD00461	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Seriously	 that was unbelievable!
LD00462	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	......
LD00464	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Why are they staring at each other like that?
LD00465	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Anyway	 it sure is good to have you back	
Joker.
LD00466	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	For real. It's like you bring us together as
a unit. I finally feel like things're gonna
be okay now!
LD00467	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	True. I guess we would feel the same if
Wonder were to disappear on us.
LD00468	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	C'mon	 you both even have similar
body language...
LD00469	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Forget all that	 everyone's here now!
LD00470	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	So all that's left is to find this Core	
right?
LD00471	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. And I believe I know where it can
be found. If we just head there and
take it...
LD00472	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	We'll be able to say sayonara to this place!
LD00473	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ahem. I believe I was speaking.
LD00474	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Heheh. You're dealing with a phantom thief
here. Of course I'm gonna steal the
spotlight!
LD00475	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mrrraaahahaha!
LD00476	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah... In which case	 I'll be sure to steal it
right back when the opportunity arises.
LD00477	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Go ahead	 I'd like to see you try!
LD00478	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I know these two act like they don't get
along	 but I think they make a good duo	 no?
LD00479	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel & M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>na	Absolutely not!
LD00480	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You're in perfect harmony!
LD00481	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	C'mon guys	 we're a team. Now let's go
find that Core!
LD00630	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hm? Looks like they dropped something.
Is this... a baseball?
LD00631	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You know	 Kiuchi's Palace had
gimmicks that involved balls too.
LD00632	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I recall seeing an ornament like this in
Kiuchi's Palace.
LD00633	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Putting balls into the holes unlocked a door	
allowing us to proceed.
LD00634	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh	 nice! Then why don't we give that a try?
LD00650	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmmm? The ball seems to fit perfectly	 but...
LD00651	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Nothing's happening.
LD00652	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Right? It's got three holes in it. Maybe
we need the same number of balls?
LD00653	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very astute	 Panther. In which case	 let us
find the remaining two balls.
LD00670	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now	 we have just one more ball to find.
LD00671	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Phew... I gotta say	 I'm beat.
LD00672	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	We've been on the move for a while now.
I'd kind of like a little break myself.
LD00673	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	It's at times like this when I really miss
the <color=#FF423F>chief's</color> coffee and curry...
LD00674	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Chief? Is that your owner or something?
LD00675	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 is it even okay for cats to have
coffee and curry?
LD00676	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hey	 I'm no pet! And I told you already	
I ain't a cat!
LD00677	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Mona's probably talking about the owner
of a caf√©.
LD00678	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	More specifically	 the one where Joker
crashes... Have you heard of <color=#FF423F>Caf√© Leblanc</color>
in Yongen?
LD00680	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I hear that both the coffee and curry there
are super tasty!
LD00681	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Isn't that right	 Joker?
LD00682	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Agh... You talking about it is making me so hungry. I want some Leblanc curry too...
LD00683	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Really	 guys? You're just gonna blurt out
where a Phantom Thief lives?
LD00684	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Don't worry	 it's just Closer and her pals.
We wouldn't be here right now if it weren't
for them!
LD00685	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And we promise to not tell anyone.
LD00686	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The same goes for you guys! Keep our
identities as phantom thieves a secret	
okay?
LD00687	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Of course! Cross our hearts!
LD00711	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's called the Book of Baseball... but it's
entirely about Kiuchi's life!
LD00712	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This seems kinda sketchy...
LD00713	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed it does. We ought to keep it in
our possession	 just in case.
LD00731	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a ghastly tome. A m√©lange of lust
for the opposite sex and a desire to suppress
them.
LD00732	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	A lot of girls' names are in here. Mine	
Tomoko's	 and plenty of others...
LD00733	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears as though it's linked to Kiuchi.
Yet it's in this makeshift version of
Kamoshida's Palace?
LD00734	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Whatever the case	 I suppose we ought to
hold onto it for safekeeping.
LD00751	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The title says "Punishment	 but... It's all
about Kiuchi shoulder checking people!
LD00752,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Punishment"? All that coward did was
target vulnerable girls!
LD00753	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears to be related to Kiuchi. We should
take this with us just in case.
LD00770	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 the bookshelf moved by itself! It's
like we're in a detective novel or something!
LD00771	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There appears to be a room ahead.
LD00772	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Our last ball's probably in there! C'mon	
let's go get it!
LD00790	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	That's the third one! We did it!
LD00791	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 this should be able to stop that scythe.
LD00792	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Alright	 let's head back there!
LD00793	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Ah! Another shield!? But we just broke the
first one!
LD00794	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I was afraid of this... It'll keep
regenerating as long as the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> is
still intact.
LD00795	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I concur. We must neutralize the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> to
prevent the shield from coming back.
LD00796	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Should we really be attacking it? Don't we
need it to get out of this place?
LD00797	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So long as we don't destroy it. Show
restraint when you attack it.
LD00798	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Easier said than done	 you know...
LD00799	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Listen	 whining's not gonna get us anywhere!
Let's do this already!
LD00500	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's gotta be the Core behind that guy	
right?
LD00501	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Just look at that thing! I bet he eats
intruders for breakfast!
LD00502	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Looks a little creepy if you ask me...
I don't know if it's a Shadow or not	but ugh.
LD00503	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I feel ya. It's giving me some bad vibes too.
And I'm not just talking about how it looks.
LD00504	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The Core? No	 wait. Is that Treasure!?
LD00505	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Treasure! Come to papa!
LD00506	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa! Mona just perked up all of a sudden!
LD00508	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Perhaps the sight of the Treasure has whipped
him into a frenzy.
LD00509	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though technically speaking	 that is but a
Core	 not a Treasure.
LD00510	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Snap out of it already.
LD00511	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ah... What was I doing?
LD00512	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps the Core contains catnip?
LD00513	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Again	 I'm not a cat!
LD00514	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	And what about you? What's an owl doing
wearing that weird hood!?
LD00515	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoo!? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? This hood
is hip! With it! The bee's knees!
LD00516	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 you two. That's enough.
LD00517	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel & M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>na	Grrr...
LD00518	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whatever the case is	 the only move here
is to take that thing out and get the Core	
right?
LD00519	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Let's do this!
LD00521	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	It's ours!
LD00530	Raga	Everything... Everything... I want it all...
LD00531	Sinner of Lust	Status	 fame	 dreams	 wishes	 desires...
LD00532	Raga	I want it all... Everything that will satisfy
my heart...
LD00533	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's with this dude? He's massive!
LD00534	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He changed his form to safeguard the
Core. I'd say it's time to go all out!
LD00550	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yesss! That's right	 you're no match for us!
LD00551	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Something about that enemy seemed
awfully familiar... But maybe it's my
imagination?
LD00552	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Well. Either way	 we beat them and
everyone's still okay.
LD00553	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Go take the Core	 Wonder.
LD00554	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Oh	 I knew it...
LD00555	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Knew what?
LD00556	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We took the Core giving this space its
shape. It's only natural for it to collapse
now.
LD00557	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Uhhh... which means?
LD00558	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This place is about to fall apart! Hurry it
up	 time for a tactical retreat!
LD00570	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Nice	 we made it to the exit!
LD00571	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Uuugh	 I'm exhausted...
LD00572	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm glad we managed to make it before the
castle crumbled.
LD00573	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With the Core in our possession	 whatever
was preventing our escape seems to have
dissipated.
LD00574	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But there's no telling when this place could
collapse as well. We should leave at once.
LD00575	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So... Does that mean this is where we say
goodbye to Panther and the others?
LD00576	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Closer...
LD00577	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I hope you get payback for Tomoko-chan.
LD00578	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 I totally will!
LD00579	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	And good luck with Shiho	 Panther. I know
you can do it.
LD00580	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah. Thanks!
LD00581	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Aww	 having to say bye here just when we
became friends is kinda sad.
LD00582	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Who knows	 maybe we'll get to meet again
if our Meta-Navs go on the fritz some more.
LD00583	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Sure	 but that's kind of a scary thought...
LD00584	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Haha! I'm sure we'll find a way to meet
again.
LD00585	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I really hope so!
LD00586	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Come on already! We don't have time for
long goodbyes here!
LD00587	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should also be on our way before this
place collapses!
LD00588	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	See? I don't care what they say	 those two
are in perfect sync.
LD00589	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Thanks for the help.
LD00591	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Of course. Let's meet again.
LD00610	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmm? Hold on... what were we trying to
do again?
LD00611	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right. We're heading into the Metaverse to
infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today	 right?
LD00612	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed we are. You've both become much
stronger	 so I'm confident we'll have that
Treasure soon.
LD00613	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really? Hah	 good to hear!
LD00614	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I gotta hurry up and find it... for Tomoko's
sake too!
LD00616	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why the vacant look? It's as if you were
overcome by a bout of melancholia.
LD00618	Sin<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>er of Lust	Crown	 grant me power...!
More	 MORE!
LD00619	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The crown gave him a <color=#FF423F>shield</color>...! And he seems
to have gotten stronger.
LD00620	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Breaking the <color=#FF423F>shield</color> might weaken him!
LD00621	Sin<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>er of Lust	My power...
LD00622	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	No way! He's healed!? Is it because the
<color=#FF423F>Core</color>'s on his head?
LD00623	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Most likely... It appears we should neutralize
the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> first.
LD00624	Sin<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>er of Lust	How dare you! My crown...!
You'll pay for this!
LD00625	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Looks like we made him mad.
Everyone	 be careful!
LD00955	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So	 are we heading to Mementos today?
LD00960	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So	 are we heading to Mementos today?
LD00961	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I'm still gettin' used to fighting	 and
I don't want to drag you guys down...
LD00962	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So I'll just watch you guys from the
sidelines.
LD00963	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Learn? From us? You're taking this way
too seriously! Oh wait...
LD00964	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Does that mean I get to be your coach?
That actually gets me kinda hype!
LD00965	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You're still quite lacking in experience
yourself	 you know...
LD00966	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Thus	 I'm most suited to be your instructor.
You may call me Lufel-sensei.
LD00967	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hmph... Who would you rather have as a
teacher	 Shun?
LD00968	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What are you two even fighting over?
Well	 whatever. I'm counting on you guys.
LD00969	Meta<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>erse Navigator	*vzzt*
LD00990	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa	 where are we?
LD00991	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... This doesn't appear to be Mementos.
Something has clearly gone awry.
LD00992	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm even getting an odd sense of d√©j√† vu.
How about you	 Wonder?
LD00994	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just as I thought... It's a rather eerie
sense of familiarity.
LD00995	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Before it was a sort of medieval castle.
An imitation of a Palace belonging to a
man called Kamoshida	 I believe.
LD00996	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Kamoshida? Who's that?
LD00997	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I couldn't say. In fact	 I'd like to know the
answer to that myself.
LD00998	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes... An imitation of a Palace belonging
to a man known as Kamoshida.
LD00999	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Kamoshida? Who's that?
LD01000	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I couldn't say. In fact	 I'd like to know the
answer to that myself.
LD01001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Anyway	 where'd Arai go? Er	 I guess
it's Closer when we're in the Metaverse.
LD01002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah! Indeed	 she's nowhere to be found.
How could it have taken me so long to
notice?
LD01003	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Maybe we were the only ones who got sent to
this place?
LD01004	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No	 Closer was with us when we were sent
here. I can't imagine she's been left behind.
LD01005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It isn't impossible that only Closer was
separated from the group and ended up in
a different part of the Metaverse.
LD01007	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 staying here will get us nowhere. We
ought to begin by finding her.
LD01008	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Should we really be moving without a plan?
We don't even know where we are.
LD01009	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If this is anything like before	 stealing
this Palace's Core will allow us to escape.
LD01010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And given that we suddenly regained our
memories upon arrival...
LD01011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It could be that certain other individuals
have come to this world as well.
LD01012	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Who're you talkin' about?
LD01014	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Other ones? Okay	 I have no idea who
you're talking about...
LD01015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Do you remember when I said that we once
came to a place resembling the Palace of a
man named Kamoshida?
LD01016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We met people who were familiar with it.
LD01017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though they were accompanied by a
companion that one would hesitate to
call human...
LD01018	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So someone like you	 I guess? They got
a hooded goblin with them too?
LD01019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How dare you liken me to that thing! And
don't call me a hooded goblin!
LD01020	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What're you getting so mad about?
LD01021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That's enough from you. Let's move out
already.
LD01022	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hold on a second. Shouldn't we at least see
if we can get outta here normally before we
do anything?
LD01023	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... We couldn't before	 but I concede	
giving it a try would be worthwhile.
LD01024	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Right? Now	 let's see here...
LD01025	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No luck. We're stuck here.
LD01026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hrm... It seems that we do indeed need to
steal the Palace's Core like before.
LD01027	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So you're saying that creepy building over
there is this Palace we're looking for?
LD01028	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed. Perhaps our old friends have already
beat us inside...
LD01029	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Speaking of them	 what're they like? Besides
being Phantom Thieves.
LD01031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I wouldn't call them bad	 at least. Well	
aside from that quasi-cat.
LD01032	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's a quasi-cat?
LD01033	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 I guess there's no need to worry if
you two vouch for 'em.
LD01034	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Those individuals were fascinating. They
seemed to have... strong convictions.
LD01035	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So they stay true to who they are	 huh?
I like people like that.
LD01036	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well then	 let's start investigating that
building.
LD01037	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The door appears to be unlocked. It seems
we are not the first visitors.
LD01038	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Are you prepared? If so	 let's head inside.
LD01050	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wh-What's going on!?
LD01051	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the unlocked door was a trap! How could
I have fallen for something so simple...
LD01052	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We must run	 before we're surrounded!
LD01053	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Wonder!
LD01054	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn it! These things are in the way!
LD01055	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Brace yourself	 Soy! Defend yourself!
LD01057	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>male Voice	Wonder! Watch out!
LD01070	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Could it be...? Panther!
LD01071	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. Please	
assist Wonder!
LD01072	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	All right	 just leave this to me!
LD01073	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Fox	 let's do this!
LD01074	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Of course. My blade will tear them asunder!
LD01090	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Phew... Somehow managed to make it out
of that one. You okay	 Wonder?
LD01092	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 don't sweat it! Just returning the
favor.
LD01093	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Don't forget	 you were the one who saved
me last time!
LD01094	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	So you're Wonder. I've heard about you. Yes...
Something about you does resemble Joker.
LD01095	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Right? Kinda mysterious	 but you can always
count on him!
LD01096	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Thank you for your assistance. So	 you found
your way in here as well. I knew it.
LD01097	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	What is this inexplicable creature!?
LD01098	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I-Inexplicable!?
LD01099	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	He doesn't look that weird. It's not like
he's that different from Mona	 right?
LD01100	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoooooo!?
LD01101	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Must I repeat myself a second time!? Do not
associate me with that detestable creature!
LD01102	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 I take it this isn't the first time this
conversation's happened.
LD01103	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Might those protrusions on your head be ears?
Or are they an accessory of sorts?
LD01104	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	What a peculiar look! Would you allow me to
sketch you for a bit?
LD01105	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Um	 hello!?
LD01106	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 knock it off.
LD01107	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 I guess we haven't met before. Hi	 I'm
Panther.
LD01108	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And I'm Soy. Nice to meet you.
LD01109	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	You may call me Fox. I follow the path of an
artist as I endeavor to elevate my craft.
LD01110	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You're on an artist's path	 huh? I guess you
could say I'm pursuing a chef's path	 then...
LD01111	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Wait	 so you're a chef? Whoa!
LD01112	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Ah	 how fascinating. What is your specialty?
LD01113	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Ramen. Well	 I've had to quit my part-time
gig for reasons I won't get into	 but...
LD01114	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 that's a shame. I bet Skull would be
overjoyed to hear you're a ramen chef.
LD01115	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Skull...? Huh	 so you have a ramen-lover
on your side as well.
LD01116	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Indeed	 we do	 but all this talk of food is
making me rather famished. I've had nothing
but warm water all day.
LD01117	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Warm water...? Fox	 is it just me or are you
always hungry?
LD01118	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Heh. You're an interesting guy	 Fox. If
you're hungry	 I've gotcha covered.
LD01119	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we get out of here safe	 dinner's on me.
As thanks for saving Wonder.
LD01120	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	What!?
LD01121	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Well then	 let's get out of here at once.
LD01122	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hold on. We need to find the others first!
LD01123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... From the sound of it	 you've been
separated as well?
LD01124	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You guys too	 huh. Come to think of it	
where's Closer? Is she missing?
LD01125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. We were together before coming here	
but we are uncertain of her current
whereabouts.
LD01126	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I see. We appear to be in similar situations.
LD01127	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Guess that makes it clear what we gotta do	
then. Let's team up to find our friends.
LD01128	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ultimately	 whether we can get out of here
depends on if we can find the Core	 which
surely won't be an easy feat.
LD01129	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wonder	 what should we do first?
LD01131	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I agree. Strength in numbers is the way to
go. Not to mention... thing's aren't looking
good for us.
LD01132	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	We're currently missing Skull	 Mona	 Queen	
and Joker. That's four of our allies.
LD01133	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. Closer is the only one missing from
our ranks.
LD01134	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	In that case	 let us first find our allies	
then begin our search for the Core.
LD01135	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we happen to come across the Core while
we're looking for them	 we can just snatch
it up.
LD01136	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You want to secure the Core first? That plan
could work	 yes.
LD01137	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Aren't there Shadows here too	 though?
It seems safer to have strength in numbers.
LD01138	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You're right. And I mean	 I can't help but
worry about the others who are missing.
LD01139	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Why not do both at the same time? We might
find them while we're looking for the Core.
LD01140	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Yes	 that's a good plan. Now	 let's revise
the details...
LD01141	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Skull	 Mona	 Queen	 and Joker. That makes
four missing comrades on our side.
LD01142	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We're only missing Closer	 so that makes one.
All right	 let's team up and find 'em all.
LD01143	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we now have a course of action	 but
before we get going...
LD01144	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's something that I would like to share
with all of you.
LD01145	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's that?
LD01146	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense the presence of two Cores here.
LD01147	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	What do ya mean?
LD01148	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I cannot be certain... This has never
happened before.
LD01149	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	If there's two Cores	 does that mean we need
to steal both to get outta here?
LD01150	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	While I can't say for sure... I believe that
is a very likely possibility.
LD01151	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hold on	 how are you even able to sense
something like that	 Cattle?
LD01152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For reasons unknown	 Cores feel akin to
Treasures; thus I can sense them as well.
LD01153	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	From recollection	 wasn't your quasi-cat able
to sense Cores as well?
LD01154	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Heheh... Yeah	 Mona gets super excited
about Treasures. Couldn't tell you why	though.
LD01155	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So nobody really knows why	 huh? Well	 it's
not important now	 I guess.
LD01156	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then let us commence our search from the
closest Core and pick up our missing allies
along the way.
LD01157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Any objections?
LD01158	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	If that's our plan	 then we ought to hurry.
LD01159	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I do want that ramen!
LD01170	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Where am I?
LD01171	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Mhm. It doesn't seem to be the Palace we
know. Take these paintings... they're not
like before.
LD01172	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What do you mean	 before?
LD01173	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	The ruler of the Palace was my former
mentor... An artist called Ichiryusai
Madarame.
LD01174	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I joined the Phantom Thieves to give him a
change of heart... by taking his Treasure.
LD01175	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	But I thought this Palace had collapsed after
we had done so.
LD01176	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So you are saying it resembles a Palace that
has already collapsed? And what makes it
different?
LD01177	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	This place used to be decorated with
portraits of his pupils suffering under him.
Like me.
LD01178	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see...
LD01179	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If this was a Palace	 I suppose that means
he saw his pupils as his own blank canvases	
then...
LD01180	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	A blank canvas... even that would be generous
of him. Unfortunately	 he deemed us to be
even more insignificant than that.
LD01181	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sounds like you really had it rough. You
don't need to talk about this if you don't
want to.
LD01182	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Thank you	 but it's all in the past now.
The matter has been resolved.
LD01183	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	When I lost my parents at a young age	
Madarame took me in. Consequently	 I felt
deeply indebted to him.
LD01184	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	But in reality	 he only thought of me and his
other students as mere tools.
LD01185	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	He took our work and called it his own.
All to gain fame and wealth.
LD01186	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What a piece of trash. He's like the total
opposite of Pops at Heritage Kitchen...
LD01187	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I think I knew that somewhere deep in my
heart	 I deluded myself	 refusing to see the
truth.
LD01188	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	It was Joker and the rest of my friends
in the Phantom Thieves who opened my eyes.
LD01189	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	They taught me a lesson... That you need to
stand up against injustice.
LD01190	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Stand up against injustice	 huh?
LD01191	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Judging by your expression	 I'd say those
words brought something to mind.
LD01192	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	To serve blindly makes a life of easy work	
but can one truly be alive with a hollow
heart?
LD01193	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	It is only by pursuing our genuine beliefs
that the path ahead of us will become clear.
LD01194	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. You know what? You're exactly right.
LD01195	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'd been deceiving myself as well until
pretty recently.
LD01196	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I told myself to stop getting involved 'cause
all I do is hurt those around me. I... even
ended up throwing away my pride.
LD01197	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I really thought I was the scum of the earth	
but meeting Wonder and the others made me
realize something.
LD01198	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	There are some desires you can't throw away	
even if they affect others.
LD01199	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	That's why I won't hesitate any longer. I'm
standing tall against injustice.
LD01200	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm not lettin' anyone else have their pride
or reason for living taken from them!
LD01202	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Heh. Seems you've been blessed with good
friends just as I've been.
LD01203	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Totally. You can do it	 Soy! I'm sure it'll
all work out for you!
LD01204	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Thanks. I appreciate it.
LD01205	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 now that we've reaffirmed our resolve	
I believe we ought to return to our search.
LD01206	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	That's right	 we need to find our friends. We
haven't even come across Closer yet!
LD01207	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	By the way	 was Closer able to get justice
for the friend she mentioned before?
LD01208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Heheh. Perhaps you ought to ask her yourself.
LD01209	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah	 you're right. Okay	 then let's get back
to finding everyone!
LD01220	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Treasure! Come to papa!
LD01221	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Aargh! What're you doing!?
LD01222	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Enemies are gonna swarm us if you touch that!
Didn't you just learn your lesson!?
LD01223	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ah...! Right. What was I thinking?
LD01224	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Sheesh. Well	 as long as you know. Also	
that's a Core	 not a Treasure.
LD01225	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Cores... Treasure...
LD01226	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Meeeow! Treasure!
LD01227	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	God	 you just don't learn! Enough is enough	
you freaky furball...!
LD01229	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? Wait	 Wonder? Is that you!?
LD01230	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	And Panther	 and Fox	 and... even Cattle's
here!
LD01231	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 we were looking everywhere for you two!
LD01232	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's been a while	 Skull. And you	 quasi-cat...
I see you haven't changed one bit.
LD01233	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hm? Uhhh...
LD01234	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You're	 umm... Sorry	 I can't remember your
name at all.
LD01235	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 yeah. That's 'cause we've never met
before.
LD01236	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh... I guess we haven't! I'm Skull	 nice to
meet ya!
LD01237	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Skull? Oh	 so you're the ramen-lover. I'm
Soy. Good to meet you	 too.
LD01238	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	And... what's that thing in your arms?
LD01239	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh	 this guy's name is Mona. How do I explain
this? Hmm...
LD01240	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	He's a cat?
LD01241	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	So	 what exactly are you doing	 Skull?
LD01242	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Seems something like a Core is over that
way	 but touching one of those red beams
summons enemies.
LD01243	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	And then Mona went all crazy when he saw
it. Man	 I was stuck mulling over what to
do...
LD01244	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 it's a sensor-based trap. What should we
do	 Wonder?
LD01246	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Hmm. Yes	 we are a large group now. Perhaps
we wouldn't have trouble with those enemies.
LD01247	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah	 true. Not like it's a problem if we can
just take them all out!
LD01248	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I'm the last person who should be saying
this	 but you guys are such meatheads...
LD01249	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Then again	 I guess that beats standing
around all day thinking of what to do!
LD01250	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Rightly said. How about we split into two
groups: one to fight off the enemies	 and the
other to secure the core?
LD01251	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course	 then there is the issue of what
to do with that fraud of a feline.
LD01252	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hey! How many times do I have to tell you!?
Fraud this	 feline that	 I'm a real cat
whether you like it or not!
LD01253	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Wait	 no! I'm not a cat!
LD01254	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hey	 when did you guys get here?
LD01255	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So	 you've finally decided to snap out of it?
LD01256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good grief.
LD01257	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I know you... You're that lemur we meet that
one time!
LD01258	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Who are you calling a lemur!? At least call
me a hooded goblin! Wait	 no!
LD01259	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What is with these two...?
LD01261	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Enough	 you two! We're supposed to be on
the same side	 so quit fighting each other!
LD01262	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Okay... Anything for you	 Panther.
LD01263	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	All right. Let's pick teams. Everyone throw
rock or paper.
LD01264	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Ready?
LD01265	A<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>l	Rock	 paper	 go!
LD01266	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good heavens... I can hardly believe I am on
the same team as that wretched cat.
LD01267	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	And you think I want to be with you!?
LD01268	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Okay	 then. Team Weird Critters will be
searching for the Core with me.
LD01269	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Team Weird Critters!?
LD01270	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	As much as I hate being stuck with feathers...
If that's your decision	 Panther	 I'm in!
LD01271	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	So the enemies will come once we trip the
sensor	 yes?
LD01272	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Okay	 then here goes!
LD01290	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So we just need to chop these guys up?
LD01291	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That's right!
LD01292	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Their blood shall soak my blade. I'm getting
that ramen!
LD01320	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Okay	 looks like it worked out! The Core's
all ours!
LD01321	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This is a Core...? It's like some framed
certificate with a star on it.
LD01322	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	We ain't got time to be standing around.
Taking it makes this place collapse	 right?
LD01323	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? But it doesn't look like the walls are
gonna come down on us.
LD01325	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Right? Last time we got a Core we had to
book it right away.
LD01326	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As I mentioned before	 there are two Cores
here. Perhaps that is the reason.
LD01327	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Oh	 that's right. I could smell the presence
of more than one.
LD01328	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	So I guess just stealing one won't cause this
place to collapse?
LD01329	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	That just means we'll have to find this other
Core.
LD01330	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Ah... But that means putting my ramen on
hold!
LD01331	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 did you just say ramen?
LD01332	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Okay	 out with it. I need details!
LD01333	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Oh	 yeah. I promised to make him ramen as
thanks for saving Wonder.
LD01334	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Seriously? Like you're gonna make it from
scratch!?
LD01335	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Then I'd like a bowl too	 sil-voo-play!
No ramen	 no life	 as they say!
LD01336	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Wow	 someone's sounding cultured today...
LD01337	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I beg of you! I'd like an extra-large
serving!
LD01338	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hah! All right	 fine.
LD01339	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I second that! Oh	 and Joker's a big eater
too!
LD01340	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay	 okay. Extra-large for everyone. I'll
even throw in some gyoza too.
LD01341	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hell yeah!
LD01342	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	All right	 enough ramen talk! We still have
another Core to find	 remember?
LD01343	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Panther's right. I'm worried about the rest
of our friends	 too.
LD01344	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah. There's still no sign of Joker	 Queen	
or Closer...
LD01345	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Yes	 indeed. Queen in particular. She's not
used to the Metaverse yet.
LD01346	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You sure about that? I feel like Queen would
just lay the beatdown on any baddies.
LD01347	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	They sound like a dependable bunch. Well	
we should get goin'	 and fast.
LD01348	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I can smell the Core... It's coming from
outside!
LD01349	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I concur. I sense it as well. Let's head in
that direction.
LD01350	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	At the end of the day	 you two seem to make
a pretty good duo	 you know?
LD01351	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>na & L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We absolutely do not!
LD01370	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 see that thing behind the guard? I swear
it looks just like the other Core.
LD01371	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What!?
LD01372	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You know	 something about this feels super
familiar to me...
LD01373	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Yes. A rather detestable memory... but it
seems we may have been lured to another
forgery.
LD01374	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Another one	 you say? So were you fooled
in a similar way by this Madarame fellow in
his Palace?
LD01375	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	MREOW! No	 I can't take it! The Phantom
Thieves deceived into stealing a fake twice?
LD01376	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Yeah	 the award in that frame might actually
be a little different from ours...
LD01378	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	True. It doesn't matter which is the real
one. We just have to take both.
LD01379	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	That does simplify matters.
LD01380	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Despite how cool you two act	 you really do
like brute-force solutions...
LD01381	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Of course	 I'm not opposed to them either!
LD01382	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	All right. In that case	 let's make quick
work of this guy!
LD01400	D<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>esha	Hate... Hate...
LD01401	D<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>esha	Hate	 hate	 hate	 hate	 HATE!
LD01402	D<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>esha	I hate everything that dares disturb my
heart!
LD01383	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Damn	 it's tough... Nothing's working on it
at all!
LD01384	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems we can't hurt it
while its mouth is closed.
What should we do...
LD01385	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	We could try aiming for the nose? Then
it'll have to open its mouth to breathe!
LD01386	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So we will simply force it to open its
mouth... Yes	 I think that could be worth a try.
LD01387	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Huh	 what...? Why's it staring at us like
that!?
LD01388	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems it's chosen the target for its next
attack... Keep your guard up!
LD01389	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	In that case	 what if we take out both eyes
before it's able to attack?
LD01390	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Quite a brutal strategy.	. But not a bad
idea. Let's aim for the eyes!
LD01391	Du<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>isa	I can't see! Where... Where are theeeey!?
LD01392	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Nyahaha! Perfect! It went exactly as
I predicted!
LD01393	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph... Must've just gotten lucky. But
I must commend your strategy	 just this once.
LD01394	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What's got your feathers so ruffled?
LD01395	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 don't you feel like the rest of it got
stronger after we took down the eye?
LD01396	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Indeed. It seems that simply blinding it
won't be sufficient.
LD01397	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Whoa	 wait	 what're we supposed to do
now	 then?
LD01398	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	We may just have to wing it. Assess the
situation	 find an opening	 and make a
decisive strike!
LD01399	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This guy's seriously getting' on my nerves.
But we'll just have to take him down!
LD01403	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What? Of course... These ones will revive
themselves too!
LD01404	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...What do you mean	 "of course"? You speak
as if you already knew.
LD01405	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ah. We did fight an enemy similar to this one
before...
LD01406	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why didn't you say so earlier? Don't you
think that might've been helpful?
LD01407	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Shut up! I don't think it's EXACTLY the same!
LD01408	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Geez	 stop fighting and focus on the actual
enemy! If it gets back up	 just knock it down
again!
LD01409	Mona & Lufel	Grrr...
LD01410	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	It seems that it takes some time for the
defeated parts to revive. If that's the
case...
LD01411	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Then we just need to take them all down
before they can come back. Alright	 let's
finish 'em off all at once!
LD01420	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mrrraaahahaha! This time we got our hands
on a real Core!
LD01421	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	That enemy just now	 though... It was like
Madarame but different. What was it?
LD01422	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I'm only just remembering this	 but wasn't
the last guy defending a Core like Kamoshida?
LD01423	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Still	 nothing's happening to this Palace.
LD01424	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I wouldn't say that... I sense a strange omen
of change near the entrance.
LD01426	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I agree! And who knows	 maybe that's where
Joker and the others are!
LD01440	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I smell a Core this way...
LD01441	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 and I sense a being with strong desires
up ahead.
LD01442	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Strong desires? But I don't see anyone
around here...
LD01443	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa!
LD01444	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey! Over there! Is that...!
LD01445	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	It indeed does look familiar.
LD01446	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hold on	 could that be...
LD01447	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Yeah. It looks just like Kaneshiro's Palace.
The one we were just infiltrating!
LD01448	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Kaneshiro? Who's that?
LD01449	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Err...
LD01450	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We can discuss that later. As I mentioned
a moment ago	 I sense someone up ahead.
LD01451	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	In other words	 there is a strong possibility
that we can find our friends there	 too.
LD01452	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes	 precisely.
LD01453	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Gotcha. No wonder we couldn't find them
here. Turns out they were in an entirely
different Palace.
LD01454	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	...If it even IS a Palace.
LD01455	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	An uncharted territory lies beyond this
point. Wonder	 could you take the reins?
LD01457	A<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>l	Yeeeaaah!
LD01480	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	This really is just like Kaneshiro's Palace.
LD01481	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You're right	 even down to all the creepy
parts. Doesn't it feel a little different	
though?
LD01482	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What the hell is that...? A walking ATM?
LD01483	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	The ruler of this Palace sees everyday
people as mere tools to bring him money.
LD01484	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This place is the spitting image of
Kaneshiro's Palace. They even have the
walking cash machines...
LD01485	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Imitation or not	 it feels so wrong. How
could anyone possibly think of using others
to line their own pockets?
LD01487	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You said it. It was some money-grubbing
moron who put Pops and Masa-san in a
bad spot.
LD01488	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I may not know this Kaneshiro guy	 but I'm
takin' this personally.
LD01489	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Money	 money	 money. It's nice to have	 but
I bet you'd feel empty obsessing over it.
LD01490	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose there is such a thing as excessive
desire.
LD01491	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	For sure. Money's good to have	 but only a
scumbag goes around tricking others to
get it.
LD01492	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Indeed. I cannot turn a blind eye to such an
underhanded scheme.
LD01493	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I ain't gonna sit around and take it either.
It's 'cause of assholes like him that
innocent people like Pops end up suffering.
LD01494	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That's why we gotta make sure that Kaneshiro
puts his money where his mouth is!
LD01495	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hm...? There appears to be someone near
the entrance.
LD01496	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I TOLD you!
LD01497	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We were only able to escape last time because
we found that Core thingy!
LD01498	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Woman	Even if what you say is true	 isn't it too
dangerous for us to go in alone?
LD01499	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Woman	We've both been separated from our allies.
Let's take a moment to analyze the situation
rather than running in blindly.
LD01500	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Urgh... I get your point	 but is waiting
around here really gonna get us anywhere?
LD01501	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think heading in first and gathering intel
would be more efficient...
LD01503	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wonder! Oh	 and everyone else is here too!
Phew	 I'm glad you're all okay!
LD01504	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? I don't think all of us here have met
before...
LD01505	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	You must be Closer. I've heard all about you.
I'm Fox	 it's a pleasure.
LD01506	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Queen! Good to see you're safe too!
LD01510	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wonder! Oh	 and everyone else is here too!
Phew	 I'm glad you're all okay!
LD01511	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	You too	 Closer! Good to see you're
doing well!
LD01512	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	And Queen! Everything okay? We were
worried since you're new to using Personas.
LD01515	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do you mean	 "odd little guy"!?
LD01516	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Wait	 we didn't introduce ourselves yet.
How'd you figure that out?
LD01518	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	She sure interrogated the hell out of me!
Queen was convinced I was a bad guy when
we first bumped into each other.
LD01521	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's okay	 we can put that all behind us now.
LD01524	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	She's right about that. I may have found
myself in a similar predicament if it wasn't
for Panther.
LD01525	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Well	 about that...
LD01526	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems that leaving this place causes one
to lose their memories of all that occurred.
LD01527	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Really? Again!? Stop stealing my lines out
from under me!
LD01528	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm a Phantom Thief. Stealing is my patented
move	 no?
LD01529	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	So that's why we couldn't tell you even if we
wanted. We'll probably forget this too...
LD01533	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Whoa	 you already figured all that out?
LD01535	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Hmm	 good point.
LD01536	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	There's a lot we don't know	 sure	 but we
do know that finding the Core will send
us back!
LD01539	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 hold on a sec... Is it me	 or am I
getting grilled for answers!?
LD01540	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	The desperation is clear in her voice.
LD01542	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'm envious of you...
LD01544	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Your intellect and insight are truly
remarkable.
LD01545	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've been searching for an advisor. What say
you to joining our Phantom Thieves?
LD01546	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Heeey! Watch what you're saying!
LD01548	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Listen	 I don't know about trying to poach
someone right in front of her friends.
LD01549	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph... Fine then. I will ask no more.
LD01551	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 if you do ever grow tired of them	 I'd
be more than happy to welcome you.
LD01552	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	What happened to not asking anymore?
LD01553	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Stop it	 Cattle. Sorry about the little guy.
He doesn't know when to shut his beak
sometimes.
LD01554	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Little guy!?
LD01555	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Anyway	 why don't we head inside? We still
need to find Joker.
LD01556	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I agree! I'm getting fidgety just standing
around here.
LD01580	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Unsurprisingly	 even the interior resembles
Kaneshiro's Palace.
LD01582	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	It was right around here	 wasn't it?
LD01583	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm? What was?
LD01584	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	You shoulda seen Queen. She awakened her
Persona and was suddenly on a motorcycle.
LD01585	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A motorcycle...!?
LD01586	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	She was like	 "Screw you and your new
money!" and blew the baddies away!
LD01589	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	What a valiant sight it was. I regret not
capturing the moment with a painting.
LD01590	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I know! Do you think you could do it once
more? Right here.
LD01594	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You say that	 but you did seem to be
enjoying yourself.
LD01595	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah... Fist of the Phantom Star...
LD01598	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	M-My bad...!
LD01599	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Heh. You seem reliable	 Queen. You come
across as a strong female leader!
LD01600	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	No kidding. You put the boys in line whenever
they say something stupid.
LD01601	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Now then. Would you tell us about this
Palace? We're entirely unfamiliar with it.
LD01602	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Well	 unlike Madarame's Palace	 we haven't
seen much of Kaneshiro's...
LD01603	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 right. I guess you won't know everything
about it then.
LD01604	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Well	 we haven't even pinned down where
Kaneshiro's Treasure is.
LD01605	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What's more	 Joker isn't here either.
LD01606	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	He must be off on his own looking around.
This is Joker we're talking about.
LD01607	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	All by himself? Sounds like a reason to
worry.
LD01608	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Eeeh	 I don't know if we really need to.
LD01609	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Huh?
LD01610	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
I mean he should be fine on his own.
LD01611	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Joker is swifter and more careful than us
all. I doubt any enemies will find him.
LD01612	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	True. The way he fought last time was just
incredible.
LD01613	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Indeed. So we can look for the Core on our
own without having to worry about him.
LD01614	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That's the deal!
LD01615	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Given your confidence	 we can make finding
the Core our primary objective. Now	 where
is it...
LD01616	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I sense something in the basement. I only
smell one this time around too.
LD01617	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmph! I was going to say that...!
LD01618	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Heh heh	 I got you good. Smooth like a
Phantom Thief!
LD01640	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Look at all these wads of cash... I wonder
how much all of this adds up to.
LD01641	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I'm sure it's all fake	 but imagine how much
stuff you could buy if it wasn't.
LD01642	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 what would you guys spend it on?
LD01643	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Painting equipment for me. Not just
canvases	 but new palettes and painting
knives	 too.
LD01644	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I don't know much about art supplies. Are
they pretty expensive?
LD01645	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	It depends	 but high-end tools come in
the six-figure range.
LD01646	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Six figures...!?
LD01647	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	They say a true artist can paint with any
brush	 but quality supplies are always nice.
LD01648	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	A number of my fine-tipped brushes have
seen better days... I'd replace those first.
LD01649	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	All that cash and the first thing you think
of is brushes? Man	 you sure are an
art freak.
LD01650	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I can't use money in the real world	 so I'd
give it to you as a gift	 Panther!
LD01651	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Seriously? Wow! Thanks	 Mona!
LD01652	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Given that the fake feline does not benefit
from wealth	 it appears he would rather
direct it toward his... other ambitions.
LD01653	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What's that supposed to mean!? Okay	 then
what would you spend it on?
LD01654	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Why	 steaks	 of course. Thick-cut and
cooked rare... *shlurp*
LD01655	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I've never actually heard anyone make
that kind of sound with their mouth before.
LD01656	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Steak	 you say? Then I hope you'd invite
me along!
LD01657	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Do you really have to jump in every time
food comes up?
LD01659	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Me? Well... I'd open my own store.
LD01660	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh! So a ramen joint	 right?
LD01661	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. Who knows how many years it'll be
until I can really make it happen	 though.
LD01662	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 I bet it'll totally be worth the wait!
Hit me up when you open shop and I'll
stop by!
LD01663	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I will. Thanks.
LD01664	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Heh heh... And I'll be tagging along	
of course!
LD01665	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Did you not hear what I just... Oh	 whatever.
LD01666	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey	 do you think this much money'd be
enough to build a ballpark?
LD01667	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I've always wanted somewhere to play
baseball near my house!
LD01669	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huuuh? No way! But there's heaps of it!
LD01671	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 right... I didn't know you had to pay for
that. Urgh	 curse you expensive land...!
LD01672	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hahaha! What's a plot of land ever done to
deserve your rage?
LD01673	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Honestly	 I wouldn't know what to do with
all this money.
LD01674	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yeah. I don't even know how to go about
buying fancy stuff in the first place.
LD01675	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	It's actually kind of fun seeing how far you
can stretch a little change.
LD01676	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I bet buying snacks wouldn't be fun at all
if you had stacks of cash like this.
LD01677	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You wouldn't even need to choose. Just walk
in and buy up all their stock.
LD01678	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Though with this much money	 I could say
farewell to bean sprout bowls...
LD01679	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Bean sprouts...? As in bean sprouts over
plain rice?
LD01680	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Oh	 no. There's no rice.
LD01681	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So just plain bean sprouts	 then?
LD01682	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What about you	 Wonder? What would you do
with all of this cash?
LD01684	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah... What strong desire. Of course	 it is
said that the riches can lead one to
distortion.
LD01685	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Remember	 moderation is important	 Wonder.
LD01686	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wait	 really?
LD01687	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I guess that seems like something you
would say.
LD01688	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Uhh	 I asked what you would want to do
with it...
LD01689	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Also	 what's with that look?
LD01690	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If you see this much money in real life	
don't just take it. You'd be a plain old
robber	 not a Phantom Thief.
LD01720	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>truder Alert System	Intruders! Intruders!
LD01721	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>truder Alert System	Multiple intruders spotted! To the security
room	 at once!
LD01722	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa	 this is bad!
LD01723	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh no! Look at the monitor!
LD01725	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>curity Guard	Intruders! Prepare to be eliminated!
LD01740	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's no end to them! How are there this
many?
LD01741	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	We triggered the security system. They'll
keep on coming forever at this rate!
LD01742	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ugh! Isn't there something we can do? I don't
know how long we can keep this up!
LD01743	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>truder Alert System	Intruder spotted! Intruder spotted!
LD01744	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	There's more!?
LD01746	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Huh...? Joker!?
LD01748	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>truder Alert System	Stop the intruder! Don't allow him to pass
through!
LD01749	I<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>truder Alert System	Defend the basement at all costs! Do not
let him in!
LD01750	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	We'll just have to eliminate you right here!
LD01752	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So that's Joker? Even on that old monitor	
you can see he's got some serious moves!
LD01753	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Could he be drawing their attention to help
us out?
LD01755	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	In that case	 we gotta make quick work of
these guys and track him down!
LD01760	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	All right! Let's crush these guys and meet up
with Joker!
LD01771	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Unbelievable... Did he figure out the
location of the Core all by himself?
LD01772	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Who can say. He does have sharp instincts	
so it doesn't surprise me.
LD01773	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Anyway	 let's hurry over to him right now!
LD01790	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What a place...
LD01791	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears to be a giant safe. A typical
cognition for a man obsessed with money.
LD01793	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Ah	 Joker! You're okay!
LD01794	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hey	 we were so worried about you!
LD01795	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Eh	 I figured you'd be safe. But you did make
me sweat a little.
LD01796	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Indeed. It's good to see that you're well.
LD01799	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Yup.
LD01800	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Nice to finally meet you. Allow me to
introduce myself	 I'm Soy...
LD01802	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Maybe Joker's gonna learn how to make
ramen next.
LD01803	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	So it won't be long until they'll be serving
ramen at Leblanc	 hmm? Heh heh.
LD01805	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	What!?
LD01806	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	But what of my ramen?
LD01807	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Since when did this become "your" ramen?
LD01808	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right. I sense the Core is close. It's
surely just beyond this door.
LD01809	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Which means there's probably an enemy
guarding it.
LD01810	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 right. I guess there was a big fight
last time	 too.
LD01811	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	In that case	 let's pump ourselves up!
LD01813	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Me!?
LD01814	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Uh	 wh-what do you want me to do?
LD01815	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I'm still not used to using my Persona	
so I might hold everyone back. But still...
LD01816	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I intend on doing everything I can.
I'm countin' on you guys!
LD01817	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Very well	 leave it to me.
LD01818	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	I believe that something like fate has
brought us all together today.
LD01819	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Let us treasure this bond and join together
to overcome this challenge.
LD01820	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	We will defeat the ruler of this Palace and
get our hands on that Core!
LD01824	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa	 now that's a speech!
LD01825	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	She's in student council president mode...
LD01827	A<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>l	Yeeeaaah!
LD01829	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Then let's go. This false Palace's Core is
ours!
LD01840	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That looks like the kinda guy that'd be
guarding the Core.
LD01841	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	He feels extra creepy... like	 that's no
normal Shadow.
LD01842	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Stay sharp	 everyone! Let's go!
LD01860	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	I feel it... the anger coursing through
me...!
LD01861	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	The sky... the earth... I hate all that
I see! I despise it all...!
LD01862	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	I want to destroy everything... just as
I desire!
LD01863	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	Oohhh...
LD01864	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	Why...? Why do you stand in my way!?
LD01865	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	Hate... Hate... Hate	 hate	 hate	 hate	 HATE!
LD01866	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	I will bury anyone that stands in my way...!
This time	 I will unite the powers into one!
LD01867	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	AAAAAA==
LD01868	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	AAAAAA==
LD01880	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	MEEEAAAH!
LD01881	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I got the Core!
LD01882	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just as I thought. This place is collapsing!
Hurry	 it's time to escape!
LD01890	A<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>l	AAAAAA==
LD01910	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Phew... We finally made it out of there!
Great job	 everyone.
LD01911	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All that's left is to leave now... right?
LD01912	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh! Wait	 Closer! I know we didn't have
much time to talk	 but...
LD01913	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I was able to get revenge for my best friend
in the end.
LD01914	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Really? Oh	 that's wonderful to hear!
LD01915	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I think I was able to do the same. And it
might be thanks to the courage you gave me.
LD01916	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I'm so happy to hear that! You know	 I have
you to thank	 too.
LD01917	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I woulda been in real deep trouble without
you around today	 Soy. Thanks!
LD01918	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I should be the one thankin' you	 Skull.
All of you	 really... I appreciate it.
LD01919	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Please	 there is no need. We couldn't have
done it without all of you.
LD01920	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	More importantly	 I'd like an extra-large
ramen and rice... and three plates of gyoza
when we get back.
LD01921	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	That's way more than what you asked for
before. Besides	 we're gonna forget
everything when we leave.
LD01922	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Haha! Still	 though. Now that there's this
connection between us... I'm sure we'll
meet again.
LD01923	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	You're right about that. These bonds are
eternal.
LD01925	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I imagine it should be possible. Regarding
that advisor position	 Queen...
LD01926	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You still haven't given up on that!? We're
not gonna have any recollection of what
happened here once we leave!
LD01927	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Nothing in life is certain	 you know.
LD01928	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	No way! Not on my watch! Queen's OUR
precious ally!
LD01930	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Indeed... You're right. Until we meet again	
Queen.
LD01931	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You'd better not try to steal her next time
we meet either!
LD01932	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All right	 all right. I'm not that much of
a boor. She makes an exceptional ally. I hope
you cherish her.
LD01935	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Yeah. All of my friends were okay	 and we
have you to thank for that.
LD01936	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Hope we meet again.
LD01950	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hm...?
LD01951	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Uh	 were we heading to Mementos today?
LD01952	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. I'm still gettin' used to fighting	 and
I don't want to drag you guys down...
LD01953	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	So I'll just watch you guys from the
sidelines.
LD01954	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Learn? From us? You're taking this way
too seriously! Oh wait...
LD01955	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Does that mean I get to be your coach?
That actually gets me kinda hype!
LD01958	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hey	 what's the matter? You seem to be
staring into space.
LD01959	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Are you feeling unwell?
LD01960	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... I see. Then perhaps we ought to take
the day off.
LD01961	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	True. No reason to push yourself too hard!
LD01980	Du<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>isa	I won't let you have my money! No one
can have it... No one!
LD01981	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He summoned a guard... Looks like he's
serious about protecting that money.
LD01983	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You might be onto something. If only we
could find a way to steal it...
LD01990	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	What's up with this guy? He's super tough!
LD01991	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Perhaps it has something to do with
the guards he summoned.
LD01992	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That does seem likely. Let's try taking
out the guards!
LD01993	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Got it!
LD02000	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Did it drop something? Wait	 is that
the money he was talking about?
LD02001	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa	 for real!? If we take out more	
we'll be rich!
LD02002	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Settle down	 Skull. That's not real money.
LD02004	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Of course. Figures it'd be something
like that!
LD02005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 I can sense some sort of power
from that imitation money... It might be
advantageous to collect them.
LD02006	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Okay! Then let's keep taking down the guards!
LD02015	Du<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>isa	Aghhh! Money... I need more money!
LD02016	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I know it ain't real cash	 but I feel kinda
bad for him.
LD02017	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Ah... That cry of anguish	 welling up from
deep within the soul! You can feel the pain
so vividly!
LD02025	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Wh-What is that? A giant pink...pig?
LD02026	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	That shape... It could only be a large
piggy bank. How fascinating...
LD02027	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	No way	 it's gigantic! How are we supposed
to beat something like this!?
LD02028	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't worry	 that "money" beefs us up too.
We can't lose!
LD02030	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	This just means we made it to the
main course!
LD02031	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. Your unanimous bravery in the face
of such peril is heartening.
LD02032	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Alright	 let's do this! Don't get too scared	
Skull!
LD02033	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Who're you callin' scared? Let's just beat
the hell out of this guy!
LD02041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense it too. A potent attack is imminent.
Everyone	 stand your ground!
LD02055	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? More fake money?
LD02057	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... It likely gives us the counterfeit
bills only to collect them again.
LD02059	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	What's this got to do with a laundromat?
I don't really get this	 but it sounds
like a pain.
LD02060	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we all have the counterfeit bills	 most
of them will be taken back. In short...
LD02062	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You catch on quick. We can use skills on
our allies to transfer the cash.

LD10011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Caf√© Leblanc? Hm... By the looks of it	
this establishment is closed.
LD10023	???	...Welcome.
LD10024	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Voice	Hm?
LD10025	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Voice	This sensation... Are you...
LD10026	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>t-Like Voice	No	 it's more like... Have we met somewhere?
LD10028	Ta<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>king Cat	You can hear my voice then!
LD10029	Ta<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>king Cat	That must mean you perceived me
speaking in the Metaverse...
LD10030	Ta<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>king Cat	I feel like I should remember that	 but...
I don't. What about you?
LD10032	Ta<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>king Cat	Hmm. Well	 no need to sweat the details.
You don't seem dangerous	 anyway!
LD10033	Ta<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>king Cat	It's only a vague recollection	 but...
you're also a Persona-user	 correct?
LD10034	Ta<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>king Cat	In that case	 let me reintroduce myself!
I'm <color=#FF423F>Morgana</color>	 and this is...
LD10035	???	<color=#FF423F>Ren Amamiya</color>. Nice to meet you.
LD10037	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	I see.
LD10038	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	I didn't think there were Persona-users
out there besides our group.
That's quite the surprise.
LD10039	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	It's a vast world out there! It's not
that odd for there to be more
Persona-users who we don't know.
LD10042	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	That we are! But I think we should all
keep the details of our operations
to ourselves.
LD10043	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Phantom Thieves must operate in secret.
I take it you're in the same line of work?
LD10044	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Then it's best we both avoid sharing info
that could blow our covers.
LD10045	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Let's make an agreement for neither side
to investigate the other's activities.
LD10046	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	We're all leading a double life here.
This way we can at least relax
with each other.
LD10047	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Make yourself at home.
If you'd like coffee or curry	
you can have some here anytime.
LD10049	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	I'd say... I'm more of a freeloader
who's looking after this place
while the manager's out.
LD10050	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	So... what can I get for you?
LD10052	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Glad to hear it.
LD10053	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Mewhehehe... You can't beat
the coffee or curry at Leblanc!
LD10054	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Ah‚Äî Before I forget...
LD10055	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Occasionally my friends come by the shop.
I hope you can meet them sometime.
LD10056	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	They're all... good people.
LD10057	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	See you again sometime!
LD10101	???	...ey!
LD10102	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hey! Are you even listening to me?
LD10103	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My goodness... You just stopped there	
staring into space. Are you quite all right?
As I was saying	 this place is closed!
LD10104	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But the aroma of coffee still lingers here.
The beans must have been high-quality.
LD10301	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>eerful Punk	Yo	 I heard about you from Ren!
LD10302	Ryu<#000000	j	#FFFFFF>i Sakamoto	Name's <color=#FF423F>Ryuji Sakamoto</color>. Nice to meetcha!
You can just call me Ryuji	 don't sweat
the formalities.
LD10303	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	We can't talk about any of the big stuff	
but we can hang out! Right	 {NAME2}?
LD10311	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>del-like Girl	Oh	 you're... {NAME2}? It's nice to
meet you. I'm <color=#FF423F>Ann Takamaki</color>.
LD10312	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	I grew up abroad	 but don't worry	
my Japanese is just fine!
We can chat as much as you like!
LD10313	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	It'd be a shame to waste the chance	
after all!
LD10321	A<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>tistic B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y	I am called <color=#FF423F>Yusuke Kitagawa</color>. Ren told me
about you	 {NAME2}...
LD10322	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	You belong to a different group of
Phantom Thieves? I won't ask for details	
but I do have one request...
LD10951	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Good to see you	 {NAME2}.
LD10952	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Ren's grinding some beans right now.
Want to join me for a cup or two?
LD10953	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Hm... The middle letter is C... Balaclava?
No	 that won't work...
LD10954	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Oh	 {NAME2}	 I was just doing a crossword puzzle. Care to join me?
LD10955	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Oh	 {NAME2}	 perfect timing.
Do you want to play?
LD10956	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	AAAAAA==
LD10957	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Hello. Oh	 yes... If you hear loud noises
from upstairs today	 don't worry about it.
LD10958	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Yusuke is borrowing Ren's room to work on
a painting for school. Apparently	 he was
taken by inspiration...
LD10323	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	Please model for one of my sketches.
Hmph... why the suspicious look?
LD10331	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nor Student-like Girl	Nice to meet you	 {NAME2}.
I'm <color=#FF423F>Makoto Niijima</color>	 this group's...
manager of sorts.
LD10332	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	We have a lot of oddballs	 but I hope we can get along. They're all excited to get to know you more.
LD10333	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Oh... Me? Right	 yes... I've also been looking forward to the chance to speak with you.
LD10341	AAAAAA==	Y-Y-Y-You're here! I'm <color=#FF423F>Futaba Sakura</color>...
Just call me Futaba!
LD10342	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Um... Unlike everyone else	
I'm not very good at talking...
LD10509	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Good work today.
Which coffee would you like this time?
LD10510	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	I just happened to have some beans that Haru brought over.
Should I brew these ones?
LD10343	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	I'd really love to talk to {NAME2}	 so...
I-I'm counting on you!
LD10351	AAAAAA==	How do you do? You're {NAME2}	 correct?
My name is Haru Okumura. Nice to meet you!
LD10352	AAAAAA==	I think it's wonderful to get the chance to
talk to someone from another group of Phantom
Thieves.
LD10353	AAAAAA==	I understand we can't talk about details	
but I hope we can have a fun time together.
LD10501	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Welcome! Take whatever seat you like.
LD10502	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	We got some new beans in today.
Feel free to have a coffee to
try them if you'd like.
LD10503	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	You're looking tired today	 {NAME2}...
LD10504	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Want me to get you something sweet to eat?
Or put some extra sugar in your coffee?
LD10609	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Mewehehehee... Treasure... Discovered...
Mewhehe...
LD10610	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Huh...!? I didn't say anything weird just
now	 did I? Right!?
LD10505	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	You can read the books over there
if you want. Feel free to take it easy
while you're here.
LD10506	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	A recommendation? Hm... The second from the
left there? I don't know why	 but I always
feel a bit bolder after reading it.
LD10507	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Have you met everyone in our group	
{NAME2}? I feel like there's
a connection between us Persona-users.
LD10508	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Maybe someday a group of Persona-users
neither of us knows will show up here...
Who knows.
LD10601	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Oh	 {NAME2}!
You came again today!
LD10602	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Mewehehe	 it's pretty cozy here	 isn't it?
I've got my own reserved seat here	
so I get it!
LD10603	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	The manager of this caf√©	 the chief	
he's an extremely gracious gentleman	
isn't he?
LD10604	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	He always provides me with the finest milk	
after all!
LD10709	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Hey. {NAME2}	 have you been eating enough?
LD10710	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Yusuke was so hungry earlier that he
collapsed. Make sure you're getting enough
food in you before you end up like him.
LD10605	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	I do sometimes think I'd like to try
Ren's coffee	 but...
LD10606	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Oh	 {NAME2}! Could you blow on it
a bit for me? This tongue of mine
is pretty sensitive.
LD10607	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	{NAME2}! Are you here for curry today?
LD10608	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	I'd say they've just finished cooking	
so you should get it while it's
hot and fresh!
LD10701	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Hey	 {NAME2}	 you want some soda?
LD10702	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Nobody else around here drinks it!
You've gotta join me! C'mon	 please!
LD10703	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Argh... I'm gonna drown in homework...
LD10704	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	There's math	 English	 and... damn	
something else too... I wonder if
I can ask for an extension...
LD10809	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	Hey there	 {NAME2}! Oh	 did I sound too
excited there? Hmm...
LD10810	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	Maybe it's because I was talking with Makoto
about going shopping sometime. I just can't
wait!
LD10705	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	So	 {NAME2}... There's actually this
ramen shop I REALLY recommend!
LD10706	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Ugh	 just the thought of those noodles
soaking in that rich broth is
making my stomach growl!
LD10707	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Yo	 {NAME2}! Sorry	 we started eating the
curry without ya!
LD10708	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I really worked up an appetite in gym class
today... But you make sure to dig in too!
LD10801	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	How's it going? Are you also here for
some coffee	 {NAME2}?
LD10802	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	Ren's coffee's the best! It's the perfect
drink to sip as you chill!
LD10803	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	Hey	 {NAME2}	 are you good at school?
LD10804	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	I'm	 uh... Well... Actually	 I'm sorry
I brought this up	 forget I said anything...
LD10909	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	Hmm... a motif for the painting... I feel
something coming to me but...
LD10910	Yusuke Kita<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>awa	Perhaps a cup of Ren's bitter coffee will
help me find inspiration.
LD10805	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	You have girls in your Phantom Thief
group too	 right	 {NAME2}?
LD10806	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	I'd love to meet them! We're all
Persona-users and high schoolers.
How can we not get along!?
LD10807	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	Get this! So I'm on a major diet
right now	 right? Like	 capital D diet.
LD10808	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	But then Ren subjected me to the smell of
today's curry! So now it's like what other
choice do I have... None	 right!?
LD10901	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	Ah	 {NAME2}. Have you come for
some curry? What a coincidence; so have I.
LD10902	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	I just lost three days of food money on
art supplies	 so this curry will have to
last me for that time.
LD10903	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	I go to a different school from Ren and
the rest	 but I sometimes study here
with them.
LD10904	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	You should come join us some time.
You could witness Ryuji's devastating
study techniques.
LD10959	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Agh...
Phew. Staying in the same position for so long
makes my shoulders go stiff...
LD10960	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Don't forget to stretch too	 {NAME2}.
LD10905	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	Hello there. You look tired today...
LD10906	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	I recommend you have some of Ren's coffee.
It removes fatigue with truly
unnatural efficacy.
LD10907	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	{NAME2}	 good to see‚Äîwait!
Don't move... Just look this way
and hold that pose!
LD10908	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa	I've been struck by inspiration...!
Please	 let me draw you in this
exact position!
LD12001	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Excellent work	 {NAME2}!
LD12002	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	I'm digging in to the curry first!
LD12003	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Hm? You're interested in my PC?
Mweheh	 this is my masterpiece right here!
LD12004	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	If you ever want to build a PC	 feel free
to ask me for advice anytime!
LD12005	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	I'm starting to want to squish Mona's paws.
Mona? Monaaa? Is he not here?
LD12006	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Knowing he's not here makes me want to do it
even more!
LD12007	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	Ryuji tried to down a whole bottle of soda in
one go earlier. He's actually really good at it...
LD12008	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	There's no way I could do it. What about you	 {NAME2}?
If you wanna try	 I won't stop you!
LD12009	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	What's your version of Oracle like? I'm the only
one in our group with my kind of Persona	 so...
LD12010	F<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>taba Sakura	I can't help but wonder about what they'd be like!
But I guess it'd be best not to ask too much...
LD12051	AAAAAA==	It's strange	 isn't it? Now it feels like
coffee pairs with curry	 and curry with coffee.
LD12052	AAAAAA==	Have you every felt that way too? Hehe.
LD12053	AAAAAA==	Yusuke just burst in and collapsed from hunger...
Said he ran out of money for art supplies again.
LD12054	AAAAAA==	It's nice to see he's passionate about drawing	 but
I worry about him sometimes...
Should I bring him something	 too?
LD12055	AAAAAA==	Nice timing. The curry's ready.
LD12056	AAAAAA==	A message from Ren: "Have as much as you
want." I might have a second helping too.
LD12057	AAAAAA==	About that part-time job you and Ren have
after school... I must admit	 I'm a little curious...
LD12058	AAAAAA==	I've been wondering what job might suit me	
but I haven't followed up on it...
LD12059	AAAAAA==	Ah	 I can't believe I've been here so long already.
I always lose track of time when I'm here...
LD12060	AAAAAA==	Just goes to show how cozy this place is	 right?
Do you feel the same way	 {NAME2}?
LD11001	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	{NAME2}	 how do you take your coffee?
LD11002	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Black	 milk	 sugar?
LD11004	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Got it	 I'll make sure to have some
on hand next time I make you coffee.
LD11005	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	You're the type who likes to taste the flavor
of the beans alone then? Me too.
LD11006	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Oh	 let me know if you don't actually
like coffee	 though. I can get you
something else.
LD11021	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Oh	 you cook at your place too	 {NAME2}?
A big kitchen must be nice!
LD11022	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	I just use this kitchen here...
Only to make curry	 though	 to be honest.
LD11024	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	I guess I could manage that.
Okay	 new recipe next time!
Will you taste-test for me?
LD11041	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	It's about time I reorganize this
fridge anyway... We got too much stuff from
that big sale at the supermarket.
LD11042	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	With all of this we could even make
something besides curry. I'm sure Ryuji
will be happy.
LD11071	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Didn't Morgana say something to you earlier?
LD11072	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	He asked for sushi? Sorry about that	
I'll talk to him...
LD11073	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	How much more can he want...? I feel like
I just got some the other day.
LD11043	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Oh	 {NAME2}	 just say the word and
I'll save you a plate too. So long as you
don't mind a barebones meal...
LD11061	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	With that hint... No	 that's not right...
That wouldn't fit with the
horizonal answer...
LD11062	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	This crossword's trickier than usual...
Free or not	 it bugs me if I can't
solve these!
LD11063	Ren Ama<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>iya	Any ideas	 {NAME2}? I need a
vertical five-letter word over here...
LD11101	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	So	 {NAME2}	 have you ever
had really high-end sushi?
LD11102	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Like fatty tuna	 or sea urchin	
or fatty tuna	 or medium tuna	
or kuruma shrimp	 or fatty tuna!
LD11104	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Really	 you have!? Are all high school
students rich these days?
LD11105	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Mewhehehe... I see	 I see.
Eating high-end sushi should be
reserved for special occasions anyway!
LD11106	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	What!? How perceptive of you...
Not too shabby!
LD11107	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	This is making me crave sushi...
I wonder if Lady Ann would share
some with me? Probably not...
LD11121	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Why are you staring at me like that?
Don't tell me you're thinking of
petting me...
LD11122	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Hmm... Well	 I guess I can let you give me
a few strokes. But! Don't touch my tail!
LD11124	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	You're... a much more skilled petter
than I expected. It's so nice	 I could
doze... off... Mewhehe...
LD11141	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	But to think there were other
Phantom Thief groups out there...
It really is a small world!
LD11142	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Is it possible there are also other groups
aside from us Phantom Thieves that
also use Personas?
LD11171	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	So	 {NAME2}	 have you ever
had a cr√™pe before?
LD11172	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Ren stops in front of the cr√™pe shop
sometimes... Do high school boys really like
to eat that stuff?
LD11173	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	...Is that so? Well... if you offered me a bite	
I might not stop you.
LD11143	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	If there are	 I'd love to meet them and
learn more! At least if they're as
friendly as you.
LD11161	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	Oh	 right. You should give that book
right there a read some time.
LD11162	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	It's a new one our chief brought in recently.
It's about home vegetable gardens	 I think.
LD11163	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rgana	You raise plants too	 right?
It might come in handy!
LD11201	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I've been doing tons of working out and stuff
since becoming a Phantom Thief!
LD11202	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	How 'bout you	 {NAME2}?
You got any special training regime?
LD11204	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Oh	 nice! Yeah	 you gotta use
the right equipment if you want results!
LD11501	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	{NAME2}	 do you get enough rest?
LD11502	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	{NAME2}	 do you get enough rest?
LD11504	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Oh	 I guess I don't need to be worried about you then. Still... take care of yourself.
LD11505	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	I understand trying to power through	 but you can't overwork yourself. Don't forget before it's too late that you can also rely on your friends.
LD11506	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	I think we'd all hope this place is at least
somewhere you feel you can rest.
LD11521	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Curry with coffee... I still think
the combination is odd	 but
I've gotten used to it.
LD11522	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Whenever I eat curry these days	 it doesn't feel quite right if I don't have coffee as well.
LD11271	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Ah! {NAME2}! Sorry 'bout this!
LD11272	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I feel like I'm gonna burp up for days.
I tried drinking a whole soda in one go earlier...
LD11273	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	...! Oh no here it co‚ÄîAh! Aaagh!
LD11524	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	I suppose that speaks to just how good Leblanc's coffee and curry are. Hehe	 great minds think alike and all.
LD11541	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	We just received the results from our
mock exams... Only I have discovered I made
some careless mistakes. How regrettable.
LD11542	Makoto Ni<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>jima	Despite my best efforts to give everything
another once over before handing it in...
I'll need to try harder going forward.
LD11543	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Maybe I should try studying here next time.
Would you care to join me	 {NAME1}-kun?
LD11561	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Today's coffee was a bit acidic	 but
once I started drinking it	 I couldn't stop.
LD11562	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	I just kept getting refills... Ren's really getting good at brewing coffee!
LD11563	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>koto Niijima	Perhaps he is more committed to it than I thought. Of course	 all the better I'm sure if he's developing a talent.
LD11205	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	The batting cages!? Huh...
Actually	 batting's probably not too bad
an upper body workout!
LD11206	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Good stuff! I'd better add another hundred
push-ups to my set to keep up with you	 man!
LD11221	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	It was crazy in the last Palace we
went to	 man! Or wait	 am I not s'posed
to tell you that?
LD11222	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Damn	 we finally meet another Persona-user
and we still hafta hide stuff? What a pain...
LD11224	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	Right!? Maybe if we all run into you
in the Metaverse someday	 yeah?
LD11241	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I'm in deep shit if I fail this next test...
Even Ann said so...
LD11242	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I'm doing the best I can	 okay!?
I just can't remember crap like
numbers and dates...
LD11371	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	I just saw some person wearing a weird mask!
It almost made me scream...
LD11372	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	... when I looked more closely	 I realized it was
Futaba. If you see her too	 don't be surprised...
LD11373	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	Why were you wearing that if you were only with
people you knew? Just one of those days?
LD11243	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	You know any good memorizing tricks?
Like that "PEMDAS" thing or somethin'?
LD11261	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I feel like Ren really goes nuts with
his cooking and coffee stuff for you here.
LD11262	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	I guess having someone new around
makes it feel special or somethin'?
LD11263	R<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>uji Sakamoto	So go on and dig in	 {NAME2}!
We're growing boys	 y'know!
LD11301	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	I was just out for cr√™pes	 and
they had a new seasonal special!
LD11302	A<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>n Takamaki	When I see the words "limited time only	
I feel like have to try it! What about you?
LD11304,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Right? When you know this might be
your only chance to try it, you gotta get it!
LD11305,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,True... Specials do have some weird
flavor combinations sometimes. But you
can't go wrong with the classics!
LD11306,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Ahh, this conversation is making me
want cr√™pes! I'm totally getting one
after this!
LD11321,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Hey, {NAME2}, do you have
a part-time job or anything?
LD11322,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,I was thinking getting a more active job
might be good exercise, but...
LD11324,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Oh, so like, exercising by moving heavy stuff
around? Good idea! I'll check if
any are hiring!
LD11341,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Can I say, {NAME2}...
I'm kind of curious what sort of outfits
your Phantom Thief group wears.
LD11342,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Ryuji and I have totally different styles,
so maybe you guys are like that too?
LD11471,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,I hear a lot of stories from Haru
about vegetables they harvested.
LD11472,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Even though they're the same plant, the way they
grow is so different. I'd love to sketch them!
LD11473,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,... Of course, I'm also interested in the taste of the vegetables themselves.
LD11343,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Ahh, I wanna see! I'll just have to hope
we run into you all in the Metaverse someday!
LD11361,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Mmmmm! Oh, {NAME2}!
Did you come for some curry?
LD11362,Ann Taka<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>aki,Be careful then! Ren put a lot more spice
in today's curry than usual!
LD11363,A<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>n Takamaki,Not that it isn't still delicious!
Spicy can be good! But my mouth
is on fire now...
LD11401,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Yesterday, I finally managed to complete
a painting I've been working on
for quite a while.
LD11402,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,The process was quite involved with
a lot of trial and error, but I think it
turned out well, if I do say so myself.
LD11404,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Hmhm, have I piqued your interest?
Such praise is the greatest blessing
an artist can have.
LD11405,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,It's... difficult to describe in words.
I'd prefer to let it speak for itself.
LD11406,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,All right, I'll bring it here sometime.
Then you can look and tell me
your impressions.
LD11421,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Ann recently introduced me to a song
that is supposed to be popular right now.
LD11422,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Unfortunately, my experience with music
is rather rudimentary. I can't even tell
if the song is good or not.
LD11424,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,It's very up-tempo. She said the music video
features a totally lit dance challenge	
whatever that means...
LD11441,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Ah... So... hungry...
LD11442,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,{NAME2}, do you happen to have
anything to eat on you?
LD11571,M<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>koto Niijima,Futaba's PC was making a really loud noise...
I thought that maybe it was broken or something.
LD11572,M<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>koto Niijima,She said it can withstand the proccessing though,
so I guess it'll be okay.
LD11573,M<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>koto Niijima,I'm a little worried, but if Futaba said so,
it's prboably fine, right?
LD11443,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,Or if you could make something,
that would be good. For free at the moment.
But I'll repay you... someday!
LD11461,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,The other day, I discovered a rare spice.
I gave it to Ren for today's curry...
LD11462,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,But the heat of it was shocking!
It was more than spicy‚Äîit was
somehow revitalizing!
LD11463,Y<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>suke Kitagawa,However, I can't remember what that spice
was called. Perhaps it was meant to simply
be a once-in-a-lifetime encounter...
LD13001,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Don't you think having just a coffee seems
a bit weird?
LD13002,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,The angel and devil inside me are fighting
about if I should be more productive in my
free time...!
LD13004,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Hmm, I could learn from you and Ren...
I wonder if I can cut the curry ingredients?
LD13005,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Cleaning... I'm not very good at it... Maybe
I could mop the hallway at least...?
LD13006,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Mweheheh, thanks for your input! I'll talk
about it with Ren later!
LD13021,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Actually, I sometimes have a part-time job
here, serving coffee and curry!
LD13022,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,... I'm still not good at customer service
though, so I have to wear a mask
all the time.
LD13024,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Heh heh heh... This mask is surprisingly
handy! It hides your face, but your vision
is great!
LD13041,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Lots of people seem to like this crossword
puzzle, so I got curious and decided to give
it a try.
LD13042,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,There's some surprisingly tough ones in here.
Well, they'll be easy for me, of course.
LD13043,Fu<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>aba Sakura,Wanna give it a go? I can give you some hints
if you need, hehehe!
LD13061,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Gaaah! Will you hear me out, {NAME2}?
LD13062,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Inari messed with all the figures in my room
again and now they're in all sorts of
strange poses!
LD13063,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,I hate that artsy feel they all have now!
What should I do? Should I just leave it?
LD13081,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,Secret ingredient... secret ingredient...
Ah, {NAME2}! What secret ingredient should
I add to the curry?
LD13082,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,When I looked it up, some of the more common
ones included chocolate, honey, and
grated apple...
LD13083,F<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>taba Sakura,I'm overwhelemed by all the options. If you
have any ideas, I'd love to hear them!
LD13201,AAAAAA==,Since I grow vegetables as a hobby, my school
lets me use a space on the roof for planting...
LD13202,AAAAAA==,I'm not sure what I should plant next,
though. Do you have any
recommendations, {NAME2}?
LD13204,AAAAAA==,That could work! Once they're ready, we could
roast them together, too... Hehe, that sounds fun.
LD13205,AAAAAA==,Zucchini... could that grow at school?
It might be tough, but it's worth a try!
LD13206,AAAAAA==,Melons! You're not wrong, some melons are
handled like vegetables. I never thought
of that before!
LD13207,AAAAAA==,Thanks for the input. I'll go look at the
seeds I have available and decide.
LD13221,AAAAAA==,Good day. Did you come to drink coffee today?
If so, I have some recommended beans for you...
LD13222,AAAAAA==,If you're up for a taste test, I'd like you
to try them too, {NAME2}. What do
you think?
LD13224,AAAAAA==,If you ask Ren, I'm sure he'll make it
for you, so please enjoy your order...
or something along those lines.
LD13241,AAAAAA==,All the books on the counter look like
they're worth reading.
LD13242,AAAAAA==,But who's lining them up? Today, there's even
a continuation of a series I read recently...
LD13243,AAAAAA==,I really enjoyed reading it, so I wanted to
thank them. I'll have to ask Ren about it later.
LD13261,AAAAAA==,...Ah, this? This is Ryuji's assignment.
Ah, I'm not doing it for him, though.
LD13262,AAAAAA==,He finished already, but he asked me to check
his answers. I'm just marking them off.
LD13263,AAAAAA==,The results were... well... there's
definitely some room for improvement...
LD13281,AAAAAA==,Mako-chan and I are third-years, so that
makes us everyone's senpai...
LD13282,AAAAAA==,But no one treats us differently, so it's
always nice to spend time with everyone.
LD13283,AAAAAA==,Are any of your friends older, {NAME2}? You
may find that you can be more frank with them
after all.

LD00031,AAAAAA==,A Shadow?|Is that even possible?
LD00071,AAAAAA==,What do you mean?|What is this?
LD00074,AAAAAA==,Lost Shadows?|A gathering place?
LD00080,AAAAAA==,Is that bad?|Should we do something?
LD00084,AAAAAA==,How do we do that?|Can we do anything?
LD00090,AAAAAA==,Sounds like a plan.|Guess we have no choice...
LD00109,AAAAAA==,AAAAAA==
LD00107,AAAAAA==,The Metaverse Navigator's
screen is all staticky...
LD00123,AAAAAA==,Looks like a castle.|What's with the big banner?
LD00139,AAAAAA==,Let's go inside.|We should investigate the castle.
LD00148,AAAAAA==,It's unlocked?|What a careless castle.
LD00174,AAAAAA==,You stay with Closer.|I'll go save those two.
LD00301,AAAAAA==,I told them my code name...
LD00230,AAAAAA==,Mona's cuter.|You're the cute one, Cattle.|I think you're both adorable.
LD00265,AAAAAA==,You do?|But how?
LD00285,AAAAAA==,Sounds like a plan.|Let's escape together.
LD00295,AAAAAA==,It's the heart of this place, so...|It's something important, so...
LD00818,AAAAAA==,Exercise the anger away!|Run to lift your mood!
LD00827,AAAAAA==,She's doing this for you.|That's Closer's style.
LD00884,AAAAAA==,Whoa!|Ah! Over there!
LD00889,AAAAAA==,Lufel's being pretty loud
himself, but I guess
I should stay silent...
LD00324,AAAAAA==,I'm Wonder.|Nice to meet you.
LD00342,AAAAAA==,We all introduced ourselves
and got up to speed...
LD00362,AAAAAA==,Thanks.|You're making me blush.
LD00940,AAAAAA==,You said it.|This guy is unforgivable.
LD00381,AAAAAA==,The volleyball court is full
of young women being put
through a grueling punishment.
LD00425,AAAAAA==,Everyone is clearly exhausted.
I guess it's up to me to get
us out of this...
LD00430,AAAAAA==,What's going on...
LD00432,AAAAAA==,Of course.|Sure. Can you?
LD00463,AAAAAA==,......
LD00679,AAAAAA==,Rings a bell.|I don't think I have...
LD00688,AAAAAA==,......
LD00689,AAAAAA==,Sounds like Joker and Mona
both stay at Caf√© Leblanc...
LD00690,AAAAAA==,Maybe I should pay a visit
if I ever have a chance to go
to Yongen-Jaya...
LD00691,AAAAAA==,Anyway, looking for this Core
is our priority right now...
LD00710,AAAAAA==,I picked up the Book of
Baseball and started flicking
through the pages...
LD00730,AAAAAA==,I picked up the Book of
Domination and started
flicking through the pages...
LD00750,AAAAAA==,I picked up the Book of
Punishment and started
flicking through the pages...
LD00507,AAAAAA==,What's going on?|He sure is excited.
LD00520,AAAAAA==,Yeah!|You said it!
LD00590,AAAAAA==,Same to you.|Thank you.
LD00615,AAAAAA==,I feel like I've already gone
somewhere today... I just
can't remember where.
LD00617,AAAAAA==,There's something in
my pocket...
LD00956,AAAAAA==,Let's go.| I need a bit longer.
LD00970,AAAAAA==,The Metaverse Navigator's
screen is all staticky...
LD00993,AAAAAA==,It's happening again.|It's like that weird castle...
LD01006,AAAAAA==,Let's go find her.|I'm worried about Closer.
LD01013,AAAAAA==,Other Phantom Thieves.|Other Persona-users.
LD01030,AAAAAA==,They're good people.|They were an interesting bunch.
LD01056,AAAAAA==,That's a lot of enemies...
Looks like I'll have to
face them alone!
LD01091,AAAAAA==,Thank you for all of your help.|I appreciate it.
LD01130,AAAAAA==,Find the others.|Let's search for that Core.
LD01201,AAAAAA==,That's the spirit.|Time to get super involved!
LD01228,AAAAAA==,Sup...|Same as ever, I see.
LD01245,AAAAAA==,Force our way through.|We can take them.
LD01260,AAAAAA==,Like cats and dogs...|Two peas in a pod...
LD01324,AAAAAA==,Nothing's happening...|I wonder why.
LD01377,AAAAAA==,Let's go get it.|They're both ours.
LD01425,AAAAAA==,Let's go there.|We should check it out.
LD01456,AAAAAA==,Let's find our friends.|Time to get that Core!
LD01486,AAAAAA==,Money isn't everything.|Moderation is key.
LD01502,AAAAAA==,Sorry to keep you waiting.|Hi there.
LD01507,AAAAAA==,Somehow, yes.
LD01508,AAAAAA==,Oh, right... I'm Queen. Nice to meet you.
LD01509,AAAAAA==,But is this really the time for casual
introductions? This all does feel quite
surreal.
LD01513,AAAAAA==,More or less. I was with Closer this whole
time, and somehow, we managed to avoid
enemy contact.
LD01514,AAAAAA==,Um... So you're Wonder, that's Soy, and this
odd little guy is Cattle?
LD01517,AAAAAA==,Closer told me all about you.
LD01519,AAAAAA==,I'm... sorry about that.
LD01520,AAAAAA==,Suddenly finding myself in a strange place
put me on high alert, and the next thing I
knew, there was a stranger here...
LD01522,AAAAAA==,Judging by what Closer told me, this isn't
the first time something like this has
happened.
LD01523,AAAAAA==,If that's true, then why didn't anyone bring
this to my attention before?
LD01530,AAAAAA==,I suppose that means we won't even be
able to process what happened once we're
back, either.
LD01531,AAAAAA==,Like, why were we sent here and why some
of us were separated.
LD01532,AAAAAA==,Or how this place is similar yet so different
from a Palace we already know...
LD01534,AAAAAA==,Not to mention the Core and everything
else... Is it really just a Meta-Nav error?
LD01537,AAAAAA==,That may have worked before, but who knows
whether it'll work this time?
LD01538,AAAAAA==,There are just too many uncertainties to
draw any conclusions.
LD01541,AAAAAA==,Oh, I didn't mean to sound like I was
criticizing you.
LD01543,AAAAAA==,What?
LD01547,AAAAAA==,S-Sorry. That offer is quite hard to accept.
LD01550,AAAAAA==,Hehe, I am flattered though.
LD01557,AAAAAA==,You're right. And it should be safer with
this many people... Let's go.
LD01581,AAAAAA==,It really does...
LD01587,AAAAAA==,That's so cool...|Wow...
LD01588,AAAAAA==,Oh, er, I got a little carried away there,
that's all...
LD01591,AAAAAA==,What? No way!
LD01592,AAAAAA==,Just seeing Kaneshiro's gluttonous face
caused me to snap.
LD01593,AAAAAA==,It was something that happened in the heat
of the moment. I couldn't pull it off again
even if I wanted.
LD01596,AAAAAA==,Don't call me that!
LD01597,AAAAAA==,Let's move on already! We need to look
around this place.
LD01619,AAAAAA==,In that case, I think we should head to the
basement first. Joker might even be there.
LD01658,AAAAAA==,How about you, Soy?|What would you buy, Soy?
LD01668,AAAAAA==,Sorry to shatter your dreams, but... I highly
doubt it.
LD01670,AAAAAA==,You live in Tokyo, don't you? I doubt this
would even cover the cost of the land.
LD01683,AAAAAA==,Spend it all.|Money doesn't interest me.|It's all mine!
LD01691,AAAAAA==,Okay, I think that's enough discussing
hypothetical situations.
LD01692,AAAAAA==,We should hurry up and search elsewhere.
There is the issue of Joker too.
LD01724,AAAAAA==,Are all those Shadows heading here? We're
in trouble!
LD01745,AAAAAA==,No, wait! Look over there!
LD01747,AAAAAA==,So he's okay. Where do you think he's
heading, though?
LD01751,AAAAAA==,Their numbers have thinned out. I think we
can handle them now.
LD01754,AAAAAA==,I imagine so. Still, even Joker is in danger
acting as bait all on his own.
LD01770,AAAAAA==,Just as I thought. Joker's heading to the
basement.
LD01774,AAAAAA==,You're right. Let's get going.
LD01792,AAAAAA==,Now... where is Joker?
LD01797,AAAAAA==,I really do feel more at ease with you
around. Now, this means we've managed to
fully regroup.
LD01798,AAAAAA==,Been a while.|Glad you're okay.
LD01801,AAAAAA==,Those two are really getting into it. But...
it seems like they're talking about food.
LD01804,AAAAAA==,I don't know about that. You lose your
memory of this place once you leave,
remember?
LD01812,AAAAAA==,Take it away, Soy.|Fox, you're up.|Queen, the floor is yours.
LD01821,AAAAAA==,Me...? Well, okay then.
LD01822,AAAAAA==,Ahem. We've managed to come this far
thanks to our united efforts.
LD01823,AAAAAA==,Each and every single one of us played their
part, the other Phantom Thieves included.
LD01826,AAAAAA==,While our escape is not assured... we must
still work together and get that Core!
LD01828,AAAAAA==,Everyone seems pumped up...
LD01924,AAAAAA==,Phew. Well, we got this Core thanks to all
of you. I just hope we can return now.
LD01929,AAAAAA==,Okay, you two. That's enough. This whole
world could collapse at any moment, so
there really isn't time to waste.
LD01933,AAAAAA==,Looks like this is where
we must part ways...
LD01934,AAAAAA==,Thanks again.|See you next time.
LD01956,AAAAAA==,I feel like I've heard this
conversation somewhere
before...
LD01957,AAAAAA==,Not to mention it feels like
I'm already done for
the day...
LD01962,AAAAAA==,There's something in
my pocket...
LD01982,AAAAAA==,Seems like it. Maybe the money is actually
giving him power?
LD02003,AAAAAA==,You're right, unfortunately. This is the
Metaverse, so these must be products
of cognition.
LD02018,AAAAAA==,Huh? Do you feel sorry for him or something?
Anyways, let's press the attack!
LD02029,AAAAAA==,Yes. Together, we are invincible.
LD02040,AAAAAA==,This aura... I have a bad feeling!
LD02056,AAAAAA==,Why is he scattering it around like that?
What's going on?
LD02058,AAAAAA==,I see... It's like money laundering.
LD02061,AAAAAA==,We should keep it all in one place instead.

Seems like a relaxing caf√©...
LD10001,AAAAAA==,I should come back
another time.
LD10012,AAAAAA==,......
LD10013,AAAAAA==,I can't really recall why...
But I feel like I somehow
know this place...
LD10021,AAAAAA==,I'm... inside the caf√©?
For some reason... it feels
a bit like the Metaverse.
LD10022,AAAAAA==,Yet safe at the same time...
LD10027,AAAAAA==,A talking cat?|Did you just talk?
LD10031,AAAAAA==,I don't remember...|Sounds familiar...
LD10036,AAAAAA==,My name is {PLAYER_NAME}.|I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.
LD10040,AAAAAA==,They don't seem dangerous.

LD10041,AAAAAA==,You're Persona-users, too?|Are you also Phantom Thieves?

LD10051,AAAAAA==,Thank you!|That was delicious!|You've earned a repeat customer!
LD10105,AAAAAA==,Lufel's right,
the caf√© is closed...
LD10106,AAAAAA==,And yet...
I can still taste that coffee
and curry in my mouth...
LD10107,AAAAAA==,It seems I can only go in
at certain times...
LD10108,AAAAAA==,I should come back

LD11003,AAAAAA==,Milk and sugar, I guess.|Black.
LD11023,AAAAAA==,Maybe try a new kind of curry?|How about a stew?
LD11103,AAAAAA==,I've had it.|Not really, no.|You sure like fatty tuna.
LD11123,AAAAAA==,Don't mind if I do then!|So much softer than feathers...
LD11203,AAAAAA==,I go to the gym.|I go to the batting cages.
LD11503,AAAAAA==,I sleep like a rock.|I don't really...
LD11523,AAAAAA==,I get what you mean.|It's become a staple combo.
LD11223,AAAAAA==,I know how you feel.|I'd like to share someday.
LD11303,AAAAAA==,I go for the specials too.|I stick with the classics.
LD11323,AAAAAA==,Try a flower shop.|Bookstores are good.
LD11403,AAAAAA==,I'd like to see it.|What does it look like?
LD11423,AAAAAA==,Now I'm curious.|What kind of song is it?
LD13003,AAAAAA==,How about cooking?|How about cleaning?
LD13023,AAAAAA==,What kind of mask?|Can you even see through it?
LD13203,AAAAAA==,Sweet potatoes, maybe?|How about zucchini?|Melon is king.

MOV00013,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom, so that girl used her quick wits and
persuasiveness to get her way...
MOV00014,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Her skills of negotiation are truly something
to aspire to.
MOV00015,Protagonist's Thoughts,Through watching Anne's
exploits, I learned how to put
my <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> to good use.
MOV00023,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Astounding... The gorilla stopped rampaging
to rescue that woman!
MOV00024,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,The way it climbed up Skytree with her
in one hand was simply remarkable...
MOV00025,Protagonist's Thoughts,I guess that inside the
gigantic body of the gorilla,
there was a gentle heart...
MOV00033,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I see... All their training in the lush
forest was to acquire the skills for that
climactic final.
MOV00034,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I guess their martial art techniques really
gave them the upper hand... Or would that be
the upper foot in soccer?
MOV00035,Protagonist's Thoughts,The swiftness of the
monks' movements
was a sight to behold.
MOV00043,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Although he rose to stardom through unusual
circumstances, his desire was just as strong
as when he was an office worker...
MOV00044,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,His unwavering spirit must be the key
to his <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>.
MOV00045,Protagonist's Thoughts,Watching Shiro's performance
taught me how to woo people

MOV00053,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Good heavens! Did you see all the chili in

MOV00054,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Just looking at it made me break out
in a sweat...
MOV00055,Protagonist's Thoughts,I couldn't help but cheer for
Spicy-Man as he boldly
slurped up those noodles.
MOV00063,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,So in the end, all was well... The boss who
refused to treat his employees like human
beings was brought to justice.
MOV00064,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It would have taken great courage to confront
their boss... and even more to break into
song in the middle of the street!
MOV00065,Protagonist's Thoughts,I respected the bravery of
the employees who stood up
for their rights...
MOV00073,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,So the kid thought he could outsmart
his teacher, and wound up trapped
in mind detention...
MOV00074,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,It goes to show that not everybody is
cut out to be a Phantom Thief...
MOV00075,Protagonist's Thoughts,I learned that there are no
shortcuts in the pursuit of
<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>...
MOV00083,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Blu's upbringing was not too dissimilar to
those poor children's...
MOV00084,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Right and wrong... We consider them
opposites, but in truth, they're merely
two sides of the same coin.
MOV00085,Protagonist's Thoughts,I realized that not even the
world's biggest ruby is more
precious than <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
MOV00093,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Not even the strongest of bonds can
clear away the sins of the past...
A harsh message, indeed.
MOV00094,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,And yet, it was that same bond that led the
policeman to rescue the crime boss... One
can only imagine how conflicted he felt.
MOV00095,Protagonist's Thoughts,I respected the officer's
<sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color> as he stayed
true to his values...
MOV00103,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,To think that young monkey could master
kung fu in such a short span of time...!
MOV00104,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,...Say, have you ever considered taking up
kung fu yourself?
MOV00105,Protagonist's Thoughts,I was impressed by
the monkey's skills and
unflinching devotion...
MOV00113,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom... To think that they could take on a
corporation like that with only a single
blade!
MOV00114,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,After avenging his father, I wonder what that
salesman will go on to sell next...
MOV00115,Protagonist's Thoughts,I was inspired by the <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>
of the protagonist as he
walked off into the sunset...
MOV00123,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,How enthralling! The two chefs were so close
to being caught at numerous points,
yet they always maintained their cool...
MOV00124,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I suppose if they couldn't handle the
heat, they wouldn't be in the kitchen!
MOV00125,Protagonist's Thoughts,I was amazed by the spies'
proficiency, stealing secrets
without being detected...
MOV00133,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Hoom. While much of the technobabble went
over my head, it was certainly quite the
exhilarating story!
MOV00134,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,I hope that young man enjoys his life
in the real world...
MOV00135,Protagonist's Thoughts,I gained some obscure game
<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> while watching
the movie...
MOV00143,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Wow! To think that stoic agent would take
that young girl under his wing...
MOV00144,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,Though in a way, I feel as though she helped
him as much as he helped her.
MOV00145,Protagonist's Thoughts,The bond that formed between
the agent and the girl
touched my heart...
MOV00153,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,True justice means trusting in your
muscles..."
MOV00154	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	When you stop and think about it	 it doesn't
make much sense... but it is persuasive.
MOV00155	Protagonist's Thoughts	I admired the cop's guts for
building himself into the
muscular arm of the law...
MOV00163	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though he may not have been able to save
his wife in time	 his cure went on to save
countless lives around the world.
MOV00164	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	His desire was formed from love	 knowledge	
and passion... Marvelous	 indeed.
MOV00165	Protagonist's Thoughts	Seeing the world through
the scientist's eyes gave
me new <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>...
MOV00173	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It was only once the townspeople recognized
the pain in their hearts that they could
finally begin to rebuild from the war...
MOV00174	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps that was the reason the violinist
came to the town‚Äîto signal the true end
of the war...
MOV00175	Protagonist's Thoughts	I was deeply moved by both
the artistry of the movie
and the man's <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
MOV00183	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So he used that expensive wine as
disinfectant to save the father who
disapproved of their marriage...
MOV00184	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The two of them gave up everything they had
for the sake of love... What a bold decision
they made.
MOV00185	Protagonist's Thoughts	The way the two boldly fought
for love in times of turmoil
pulled at my heartstrings.
MOV00193	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My my	 so the humans managed to fend off
the alien invasion. Impressive	 indeed.
MOV00194	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But how will Planet Earth survive without
its moon...?
MOV00195	Protagonist's Thoughts	The deep sci-fi story really
sparked my imagination...
MOV00203	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I get the impression that much of the
back-and-forth is improv...
MOV00204	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...but the mystery itself is quite
fascinating. I can see why people are
saying the film is interesting.
MOV00205	Protagonist's Thoughts	I was charmed by the
comedians' witty adlibs...
MOV00213	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Good gracious. The ninja brutally murdered
almost everyone that crossed his path	
all to reclaim his master's gold...
MOV00214	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The corruption of wealth is truly something
to be feared.
MOV00215	Protagonist's Thoughts	I could feel the young
samurai's bravery amidst the
tense psychological warfare...
MOV00223	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Who would have thought that the director's
hip pain would be cured by belly dancing?
MOV00224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose one is never too old to dance!
MOV00225	Protagonist's Thoughts	My heart was warmed
by the depth of the
caregiver's compassion...
MOV00233	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Though her cybercrimes were unforgivable	
you can't help but sympathize with
the poor idol.
MOV00234	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps even AI idols long to be loved.
MOV00235	Protagonist's Thoughts	I was captivated by the
deadly <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color> of
the AI pop idol...
MOV00243	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the two mermaids were able to see past
their scales and learned to love one another.
How heartwarming.
MOV00244	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...Shame about the ship crash	 though.
MOV00245	Protagonist's Thoughts	I was moved by the romance
that bloomed between
Tita and Nick...
MOV00253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My word. That blind agent's sense of smell
is simply stupendous!
MOV00254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...But how did he know what aliens smelled
like in the first place?
MOV00255	Protagonist's Thoughts	I was floored by the blind
agent's sharpened senses...
MOV00263	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't believe they used the enemy's
man-made planet to pull off such an
audacious trick shot!
MOV00264	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The gravitational force was strong in her	
indeed...
MOV00265	AAAAAA==	It would have taken true
skill to master billiards
on a galactic scale.
MOV00273	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the park became the domain of
mutant pigs... Frankenswine's monsters	
if you will!
MOV00274	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I must say	 I did find the part where the
child evolved by eating genetically enhanced
bacon to be a little far-fetched...
MOV00275	Protagonist's Thoughts	I was shaken by the ingenuity
of those clever little pigs...
MOV00283	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the pilot fulfilled his destiny and
became the pharaoh of legend...
MOV00284	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You know	 the bond that formed between the
man and the bird feels curiously familiar...
MOV00285	Protagonist's Thoughts	It must have taken real guts
to ride into the danger zone
like that...
MOV00293	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Spectacular... That little carrot uncovered
the arson plot that threatened to divide
Plantopia.
MOV00294	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Her passion to protect both fruit
and veggies alike was stronger than
the hottest flames.
MOV00295	Protagonist's Thoughts	I gained lots of <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>
about fruits	 veggies	
and even firefighting...
MOV00303	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Some like it cold. Who knew the prima donna
would say that as she gunned down the mafia?
MOV00304	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That woman... She was far scarier than the
mafia boss	 wouldn't you agree?
MOV00305	Protagonist's Thoughts	I learned that charm
comes in many forms...
both graceful and deadly!
MOV00010	AAAAAA==	You say your gonna talk your way into taking over their ship...?
You've gotta be kiddin'! They'll never listen to ya!
MOV00011	AAAAAA==	One day	 they'll tell tales of Captain Curly-Hair Anne	
the greatest pirate to ever sail the seven seas!
MOV00012	AAAAAA==	I'll confront their greed with knowledge!
When I make a decision	 I always see it through!
MOV00020	AAAAAA==	Bombing the capital will wipe out that rampaging gorilla... and the
government with it! But don't you worry‚ÄîI'll have this city functioning again!
MOV00021	AAAAAA==	That's your master plan!? Don't be so full of yourself!
MOV00022	AAAAAA==	The greatest threat to humanity isn't the gorilla... It's humanity itself!
MOV00030	AAAAAA==	It's all coming back to me...
MOV00031	AAAAAA==	What?
MOV00032	AAAAAA==	I can feel it. The passion from our days training
in the forest together... It's all flooding back to me!
MOV00040	AAAAAA==	Let's run! Don't fight that idol!
MOV00041	AAAAAA==	Why not? I've had enough of running away.
And now I've finally realized what it is that I want...
MOV00042	AAAAAA==	This burning soul... yearns to be a superstar!
MOV00050	AAAAAA==	...But I'm nothing without my Spicy Suit!
There's no way I can slurp down those fiery noodles now!
MOV00051	AAAAAA==	Hmph! If you can't do it without your suit	
then you don't deserve to call yourself a hero!
MOV00052	AAAAAA==	C'mon	 eat the spicy ramen! You're the friendly neighborhood food fighter
we're all counting on	 aren't you!? Then stand up and start chomping!
MOV00060	AAAAAA==	You dare blame me for the stress of my employees?
MOV00061	AAAAAA==	I don't blame you	 sir. I blame the company's
policies that treat people like machines.
MOV00062	AAAAAA==	The only way to bring about change is to reform the system and hire
reasonable managers who put the wellbeing of employees first!
MOV00070	AAAAAA==	I've successfully infiltrated Sensei's subconscious!
Now to find the answers to the test...
MOV00071	AAAAAA==	This is my mind	 so you're going to play by my rules!
MOV00072	AAAAAA==	Sensei! Forgive me for my actions! I'll forget everything I saw	
so please just let me out of here!
MOV00080	AAAAAA==	We're going to steal the world's biggest ruby...
One that's even bigger than a watermelon!
MOV00081	AAAAAA==	You mean we get to be thieves? Awesooome!
MOV00082	AAAAAA==	That's right	 kiddos. You can use whatever weapons
and gadgets and cool cars you like!
MOV00090	AAAAAA==	You drove off the bridge to save me... I owe you my life	 brother!
MOV00091	AAAAAA==	Now	 we've got an important job tomorrow...
We're gonna hit that armored truck and rob 'em blind!
MOV00092	AAAAAA==	Brother... The truth is... I'm a police officer	
and I'm here to arrest you for that hijacking incident!
MOV00100	AAAAAA==	It's clear you aspire to rule the valley	 but I will stop you!
Now enough of this nonsense! Let's settle this in battle!
MOV00101	AAAAAA==	Zen-jou-in...? Preposterous... That secret technique was lost to time!
MOV00102	AAAAAA==	Oh	 you've heard of it	 have you? Mastering this move
marked the final stage of my training! Hiii-yaaah!
MOV00110	AAAAAA==	With my knack for sales and your talent for swordmaking	 we can
take down that damn company and make money lying down.
MOV00111	AAAAAA==	Can I ask	 who are you exactly?
MOV00112	AAAAAA==	I'm a humble salesman who plans to take over
that company and bleed them dry.
MOV00120	AAAAAA==	I had no choice back then. But now	 I want to
devote myself to savory tofu pudding.
MOV00121	AAAAAA==	You're a spy who came here on your master's orders	 aren't you!?
Your love of savory tofu pudding is a total lie!
MOV00122	AAAAAA==	No	 I truly do love them... but I'm also quite fond of sweet tofu pudding.
MOV00130	AAAAAA==	Cheating isn't the solution! To find the key	
all you need is knowledge of the game!
MOV00131	AAAAAA==	I've got it! The password was the first ever easter egg:
the name of the game creator's dog!
MOV00132	AAAAAA==	Congratulations! A new Player None is born!
MOV00140	AAAAAA==	You're a national security agent? Wow... I think I'm swooning!
MOV00141	AAAAAA==	What happened to your family was unforgivable. I'll take you in	
but don't misunderstand; I'm doing it out of sympathy	 not love.
MOV00142	AAAAAA==	You'll never be alone again... I just need to complete one last mission.
MOV00150	AAAAAA==	You set me up! I never took the money! It was you!
MOV00151	AAAAAA==	You're not a cop anymore. All the cops in the country are on
your tail and they're out to arrest you	 not me.
MOV00152	AAAAAA==	Then I'll have to take the law into my own hands	
and make sure that justice is served!
MOV00160	AAAAAA==	Dear	 I don't have much longer... But I need you to understand
the difference between what's real and what's in your mind...
MOV00161	AAAAAA==	I won't give up... Not on my research	 and not on your life!
MOV00162	AAAAAA==	Eureka! I've discovered a miracle cure for the illness
using the mysterious formulas of love!
MOV00170	AAAAAA==	Thank you for saving my life. How can I ever repay you...?
MOV00171	AAAAAA==	Thank music	 not me. It is the wonder of music that
gives us the strength to persevere through the war.
MOV00172	AAAAAA==	Please	 at least tell me your name! I wish to hear you play again someday...!
MOV00180	AAAAAA==	I never sell anything without expecting something in return.
You desire wine	 and well	 I desire an extraordinarily beautiful woman.
MOV00181	AAAAAA==	If you think our country can afford your wine	
then I'm afraid you're sorely mistaken...
MOV00182	AAAAAA==	Frankly	 my dear	 I don't give a hoot.
MOV00190	AAAAAA==	Leave our planet and go back to Centaurus	 you filthy vermin!
MOV00191	AAAAAA==	Those horrid humans...! Launch the planet generators!
We'll use them to propel the Moon back to our home!
MOV00192	AAAAAA==	This voyage across the cosmos will last 400 years... What awaits us we know not	
but our courage and perseverance will shine as bright as the stars.
MOV00200	AAAAAA==	Humans come into this world naked. Leaving it with even a pair of underwear
on is lucky. But it seems our vic has left with everything but his hat...
MOV00201	AAAAAA==	So either it was stolen by the culprit	 or‚Äîmaybe	
just maybe‚Äîthe victim misplaced it...?
MOV00202	AAAAAA==	Oh	 c'mon! If you think the hat's irrelevant to the case	 then just say that!
Or doncha have the guts to admit to your mistakes!?
MOV00210	AAAAAA==	Heads or tails? Call it. If you get it wrong	 you lose everything.
MOV00211	AAAAAA==	But if I'm right	 do I stand to win all these gold coins!?
MOV00212	AAAAAA==	The longer you refuse to return what you stole	
the more you risk to lose...
MOV00220	AAAAAA==	Come on	 everybody. Let's practice our dance moves to ring in the New Year!
MOV00221	AAAAAA==	But the doctor told me I can't leave from my bed...
MOV00222	AAAAAA==	...I can't believe it! They've all regained their vigor!
Thank you for bringing dance into this home! Please	 I beg you to stay!
MOV00230	AAAAAA==	Dear Mr. President! What do you get when you piss off a psychotic AI idol
that's been abandoned by the internet and treated like malware?
MOV00231	AAAAAA==	Stop the livestream! Somebody get rid of this virus now!
MOV00232	AAAAAA==	You get what you deserve! For I am this country's one and only idol!
MOV00240	AAAAAA==	Stay back! If you come any closer	 I'll throw myself overboard!
MOV00241	AAAAAA==	If you do	 I'm gonna have to jump in there after you.
MOV00242	AAAAAA==	I can't believe you really jumped after me!
Don't tell me... you're a mermaid	 too!?
MOV00250	AAAAAA==	Sir! That woman is the vice principal of the school!
She was the one who threatened to have me expelled!
MOV00251	AAAAAA==	Kid... When you've lived in the dark for as long as I have	
you can detect a person's true nature from their scent alone...
MOV00252	AAAAAA==	And underneath that skinsuit is a translucent	
faceless	 four-legged alien with glowing guts...
MOV00260	AAAAAA==	Fear... The order of this galaxy shall be maintained
through fear of the Star Killer!
MOV00261	AAAAAA==	Is this... Slatewalker's cue stick?
Can an amateur like me really wield it...?
MOV00262	AAAAAA==	You're holding it wrong! Just close your eyes
and let your inner pool shark guide you...
MOV00270	AAAAAA==	Those mini-pigs have learned to teleport! Get rollin'! We've gotta catch 'em!
MOV00271	AAAAAA==	Say what!? Then it's going to take more than brute force to stop them!
MOV00272	AAAAAA==	What if we send the kid? He's evolved already	
so this should be a piece of cake!
MOV00280	AAAAAA==	With the power of the sun in my hands	 your fate is sealed. Prepare to die!
MOV00281	AAAAAA==	I'm always prepared... but I'm afraid I won't be kicking the bucket today!
MOV00282	AAAAAA==	Is that... the Storm Crow!? Impossible!
How can you control the ultimate Mecha Beast!?
MOV00290	AAAAAA==	Nothing's impossible in Plantopia!
I'm gonna be a great firefighter someday	 just watch!
MOV00291	AAAAAA==	That's what all the new plants say when they come here.
Just give up on those foolish dreams already	 you silly carrot.
MOV00292	AAAAAA==	No way! As long as I study hard	 I know I'm capable of putting out fires!
I'll make this city a safer place!
MOV00300	AAAAAA==	You want to match me	 a Queen Swan?
You'll have to practice all night	 lest you wish to remain ugly ducklings!
MOV00301	AAAAAA==	-Arabesque? You expect us to do that right off the bat!?
-But that's impossible! Nobody's perfect...!
MOV00302	AAAAAA==	Perfect isn't all about skill. Adding a dose of charm is just as important!

Nah	 that's a stretch...
MP100011	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	They use code words to communicate in spy

that too?
MP100013	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Will I remember the code?
MP100014	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's uhhh... Well... Ahahahaha...
MP100021	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You're pretty skilled	 {NAME2}.
MP100022	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The way you handle wires to infiltrate each
Palace blows me away.
MP100023	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Not to mention	 you're the one who makes all
our break-in tools!
MP100024	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That sort of stuff is too fiddly for me.
Guess you could say I'm kinda jealous!
MP100101	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I put on my swimsuit and everything	 but...
MP100102	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We can't even swim here. This kinda sucks...
MP100103	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	At the bare minimum	 this place needs an
indoor pool. Ooh! How about we make one now!?
MP100111	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Hey {NAME2}! When I say "summer" and "sports	
what comes to mind?
MP100112,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,For me, it's Koshien Stadium and the sizzling
drama between Japan's top teen baseball
stars at nationals!
MP100113,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Everyone giving each ball 110%...
Now THAT'S youth!
MP100114,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Huh? Whaddya mean you've never been to Koshien!?
MP100121,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,It hit me again that the cognitive world
really is something else.
MP100122,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Even wearing a swimsuit can change my
Persona's abilities.
MP100123,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,What if I try on other clothes? Will her
abilities change again?
MP100124,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Ooh, now I gotta find out!
MP100201,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, this place got a kitchen?
MP100202,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I wanna treat everyone to ramen,
since we're here.
MP100203,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But where do I even get the ingredients?
Whatever, I'll figure it out!
MP100211,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Bein' a Phantom Thief is tougher than
I thought.
MP100212,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Especially when we gotta hide from
the enemy...
MP100213,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I ain't a particularly stealthy guy...
MP100214,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But I made a commitment. I probably shouldn't
talk like that now.
MP100215,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Sorry. Forget I mentioned it.
MP100221,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Random question. Ain't it hard to juggle
multiple Personas?
MP100222,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,I've only got Mandrin, so that ain't
too bad...
MP100223,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,But more than one sounds hella confusing.
I don't think I could deal with it.
MP100224,Shun K<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>no,Hey, {NAME2}. You really know how to kick
ass without breaking a sweat.
MP100301,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,What manner of place is this?
MP100302,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,It feels like a Palace, yet the atmosphere is
slightly different...
MP100303,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,At any rate, I'm curious. It appears safe,
but I feel the need to investigate further.
MP100311,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I'd like your honest opinion.
MP100312,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Do you all think the support I provide in
battle is... adequate enough?
MP100313,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I'm doing my best, but there is always room
for improvement.
MP100314,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,If you have any feedback, please do not
hesitate to tell me.
MP100321,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,As head of the Disciplinary Committee, I can
only somewhat empathize, but...
MP100322,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Leadership isn't easy, is it?
MP100323,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I'm sure you have your fair share of fears
and concerns...
MP100324,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,But do not bear those burdens alone.
My door is always open.
MP100401,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I find it difficult to relax under
such circumstances.
MP100402,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Yes, my outfit is different. But I also feel
boundless energy brimming within me.
MP100403,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I fear I may lose control if my mind drifts
for even a moment.
MP100411,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I have a rather strange question... How do
you like my new Thief outfit?
MP100412,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Hm? It's cute, you say? No, that's not what
I meant...!
MP100413,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I only asked because I wondered if it was too
flashy for a Phantom Thief...
MP100414,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Still, thank you.
MP100421,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Utilized properly, this power will be a
valuable asset to our cause.
MP100422,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,But conversely, the slightest mistake could
endanger everyone.
MP100423,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,Please, {NAME2}, look out for me so that
my powers may never hurt anyone.
MP100424,Riko Ta<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>emura,I have complete faith in your guidance,
{NAME2}.
MP100501,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Honestly though, the beach house's food was
pretty expensive, wasn't it?
MP100503,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,I know that, and I get that it isn't going to
change, but it's hard on a student budget.
MP100504,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,You ate a lot of stuff there though, Motoha!
MP100505,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Hey! What do you expect me to do when there's
so much yummy food right in front of me!?
MP100506,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,And shaved ice is like 50% tastier when you
eat while looking out at the sea, too!
MP100507,Mo<#000000,t,#FFFFFF>oha Arai,Not to mention that seafood ramen Shun
tempted me into was amazing, too! Mmm!
MP100508,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Ahaha... Yeah, I understand. I even get
tempted when I'm sending orders.
MP100509,Tomoko No<#000000,g,#FFFFFF>e,Like, Aah	 this looks so good	 I'll need to
get some for myself later!" Y'know?
MP100510	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Then I'd forget about how obvious a food
baby's gonna look in a swimsuit...
MP100511	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	So you're saying you also gave in to the
beach house delicacies too	 Tomoko?
MP100512	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What about you	 {name2}? Is there
anything from the beach hut you really
like to eat?
MP100514	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The toppings were arranged so nicely	 it made
me want to try all the flavors!
MP100515	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yeah	 comparing the different flavors was so
much fun! My favorite was... Agh	 I
can't choose!
MP100516	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe	 I hope we all get to go on another
trip like that next year	 too!
MP100800	AAAAAA==	Aaahh	 {NAME2}-kun! Save me	 please!
MP100804	AAAAAA==	Eeeek! That woman	 she's so... so peppy...
It's freaking me out!
MP100812	AAAAAA==	You know Shichi-kun!? Are you a fan?
I love Shichi-kun!
MP100815	AAAAAA==	Oh	 I see! Well	 any fan of Shichi-kun must
be a good person!
MP100816	AAAAAA==	And a good person's friend must also be
a good person... right?
MP100818	AAAAAA==	Then	 then... Why don't we all talk about
Shichi-kun together! It'll be great!
MP100900	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The acoustics here are perfect.
MP100901	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I bet it'd feel great to let loose and sing
my heart out...
MP100902	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe I'll do that when no one's around.
MP100920	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	A lot of people come by around here.
MP100921	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm not good at approaching people myself...
MP100922	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Luckily	 they've been coming up to talk to
me instead. I'm glad.
MP100923	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I should try to break the ice myself
sometime though.
MP100940	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	This place is so nice. It makes me want
to stay forever.
MP100941	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I feel like I can express my thoughts and
feelings without putting up a front.
MP100942	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I think I can write some good lyrics or tunes
when I'm here...
MP100960	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The sixth sheik's sixth sheep's sick...
The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick...
MP100962	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I practice these sometimes so I don't mess
up my enunciation while singing.
MP100963	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's my secret talent	 I guess. The sixth
sick sheik's sick's sheep's sixth...
MP100964	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	......
MP100980	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	It's hard to play an instrument that's not
my usual guitar.
MP100981	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I bought a kalimba a little while back just
to try it out.
MP100982	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	The positions of the notes were so different	
it took forever just to remember them!
MP100983	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Can you play any instruments besides bass?
Or are there any you'd like to try?
MP100985	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ooh	 nice! I'd love to see you play sometime.
MP101000	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	{NAME1}-kun	 have you ever
traveled abroad before?
MP101002	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I've never set foot outside Japan myself.
MP101003	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I'm actually pretty good at foreign
languages. The proof is in my college
grades	 hehe...
MP101004	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	But if I actually went abroad	 I might get
too nervous to talk to anyone.
MP101005	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe I could do it if I had someone
traveling with me.
MP101006	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Next time you're planning a trip overseas	
you should take me with you.
MP101020	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hm-hm hm-hmm<sprite=1 tint=1>
Hmhm-hmmm<sprite=1 tint=1>
MP101022	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Ack! Wh-When did you get here!?
MP101023	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Er... A nice tune just popped into my head	
so I started humming it out.
MP101024	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I didn't think anyone was listening!
God	 that's embarrassing...
MP101026	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Thank you!
MP101027	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Maybe I'll try using that melody for a
song then.
MP101028	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I was thinking of that bit as the hook...
I'll have to figure out the rest.
MP101029	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Hmm... For example	 do you think it'd work
if I followed that part like this?
MP101050	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh	 great timing!
MP101051	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	That girl over there	 that's Kotone Montagne	
right? The figure skater!
MP101052	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh my god	 what do I do!? I've never seen
a real celebrity up close before!
MP101053	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 {NAME2}-kun. Good to see you.
MP101054	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You know her!?
MP101056	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	You seriously know a celebrity? That's...
That's kind of crazy to think about.
MP101057	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Is that... You actually know her!?
MP101058	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Huh? M-Me?
MP101060	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I've seen her before! Outside the theater in
Yongen-Jaya	 practically swimming in cats!
MP101061	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Aw	 that. Yeah	 the cats in Yongen-Jaya
really love to come out and play.
MP101062	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Also	 I've seen her performing outside
Shibuya Station. I often pass by.
MP101063	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	What!? Oh... Oh	 I	 I see!
MP101064	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	I usually try not to look at the crowd too
much	 so I never noticed...
MP101065	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I always wanted to say hi to you sometime	
but I never got the chance. Nice to meet you!
MP101066	A<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>aka Sakai	Oh man	 I can feel my face burning up...
It's nice to meet you too! Haha...
MP101100	AAAAAA==	{NAME2}. Have you been
honing your gun skills?
MP101101	AAAAAA==	The key is to always visualize your aim.
MP101102	AAAAAA==	When talking to people	 I imagine lining
my sights for a head shot.
MP101103	AAAAAA==	I'm joking. Why aim for critical hits at
point-blank range?
MP101120	AAAAAA==	This place kind of feels like an arcade.
MP101121	AAAAAA==	I'm not the type of person to get excited
over the ambiance of a location	 but I
could get used to this.
MP101122	AAAAAA==	All we need is a shooting game cabinet.
MP101140	AAAAAA==	Shooting games at the arcade are my forte	
but a real life fight with airsoft guns
sounds pretty interesting	 too.
MP101141	AAAAAA==	Wouldn't it be fun if everyone here played
a round against each other?
MP101142	AAAAAA==	I'm kidding. But as the backbone of this
group	 you should consider it.
MP101160	AAAAAA==	I first got into shooting games to improve
my focus and concentration.
MP101161	AAAAAA==	Both correlate to one's surgical skills.
MP101162	AAAAAA==	However	 it's now my biggest pastime.
MP101164	AAAAAA==	Yeah. Even if I did quit medicine	 you would
still see me firing away on that arcade game.
MP101180	AAAAAA==	Lab coats are so convenient. It doesn't
matter what you wear underneath.
MP101181	AAAAAA==	No need to coordinate outfits	 plenty of
pockets	 and not to mention multifunctional.
MP101182	AAAAAA==	To say I became a doctor for the lab coat
wouldn't even be an overstatement.
MP101184	AAAAAA==	I'm obviously joking. Besides	 you don't need
a license to wear the coat.
MP101185	AAAAAA==	You should wear one sometime. Here	 I'll let
you try mine on.
MP101200	AAAAAA==	Did I tell you I have an older sister?
MP101201	AAAAAA==	She says I'm different lately.
MP101202	AAAAAA==	According to her	 I seem to be enjoying
life more	 whatever that means.
MP101203	AAAAAA==	Nothing feels any different	 but what do
you think?
MP101205	AAAAAA==	Hmm	 I see... Yes	 before there were very
few people I could call actual friends.
MP101206	AAAAAA==	It's fascinating to know our friendship
has changed me.
MP101207	AAAAAA==	Are we really friends though? How would
you even define what a friend is?
MP101208	AAAAAA==	I need to do more research and figure
this out. You're in this for the long haul.
MP101250	AAAAAA==	Unlike me	 you seem blessed with
many companions.
MP101251	AAAAAA==	Does having lots of them truly make
you happy? Do numbers really matter?
MP101253	AAAAAA==	Right	 quality over quantity.
MP101254	AAAAAA==	In that case	 I guess I should thank my
lucky stars.
MP101255	AAAAAA==	How did a loner like me get to make such
a remarkable friend like you?
MP101257	AAAAAA==	Conclusive evidence has proven so. There's
no doubt you are a true friend to me.
MP101258	AAAAAA==	It's not like anything will really
change	 but...
MP101259	AAAAAA==	{NAME2}	 I want our
friendship to remain solid.
MP101300	AAAAAA==	Howdy there!
MP101301	AAAAAA==	This place is kinda weird	 huh? There's
all these people I don't really know...
MP101302	AAAAAA==	That's why I'm glad to run into you!
I was feeling a little anxious...
MP101320	AAAAAA==	Good morning? Hello? Good evening?
I can never tell what time it is here...
MP101321	AAAAAA==	So you know what that means...
MP101322	AAAAAA==	Yep!
MP101323	AAAAAA==	The phrase to say is "howdy there"!
MP101340	AAAAAA==	Oh	 it's {NAME2}-kun!
Howdy there!
MP101341	AAAAAA==	What're you doing right now? Oh	 are
you free?
MP101342	AAAAAA==	Then why don't we chat for a while?
MP101360	AAAAAA==	Hmm... This is a hard one.
MP101362	AAAAAA==	Oh	 {NAME2}-kun! That's my buddy
for you	 always ready to help.
MP101363	AAAAAA==	So	 well... I'm having trouble deciding what
to have for breakfast tomorrow.
MP101364	AAAAAA==	Boom Bang Burger's morning set	 or
Yang-Yang's AM combo... Which should it be?
MP101380	AAAAAA==	Sometimes people mistake me for someone
rich when I tell them I live in Shibuya.
MP101381	AAAAAA==	But I'm not at all	 you know! We've just
happened to own a house there
for generations.
MP101382	AAAAAA==	The place is old	 and it's not even close
to being big.
MP101384	AAAAAA==	You? Want to come to my place?
MP101385	AAAAAA==	N-No! It's too soon for that! I need time
to emotionally prepare!
MP101400	AAAAAA==	I feel like more people are taking note of
Shichi-kun these days.
MP101401	AAAAAA==	But sometimes I get this	 well... chill down
my spine	 you know?
MP101402	AAAAAA==	I get a bad feeling that someone's trying to
expose Shichi-kun's true identity.
MP101404	AAAAAA==	No	 I'm not! I can feel it! Just yesterday
afternoon	 Shichi-kun's...
MP101405	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that wasn't coming from me	 okay?
It's what Shichi-kun said yesterday!
MP101420	AAAAAA==	So	 there's actually been something I've
wanted to ask for a while... Is that okay?
MP101422	AAAAAA==	Yesss	 thanks!
MP101423	AAAAAA==	I was born and raised in Shibuya	 so I
love it to death!
MP101424	AAAAAA==	But why do you like Shibuya so much? I really
want to hear all the details on that one!
MP101425	AAAAAA==	Because	 well... I'm the type who loves
hearing others praise the things I like!
MP101427	AAAAAA==	Whaaat? Don't be like that! Please	 I'll even
give you something nice in return!
MP101428	AAAAAA==	Look! It's a limited edition	 super rare
sticker Shichi-kun gave out two years ago!
MP101429	AAAAAA==	Hey	 wait! Don't run away! Tell meee!
MP101500	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Isn't this place kinda like a nightclub?
Omigosh	 this is so rad!
MP101501	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I feel like dancing all night! Wanna join me?
Haha	 just messing around!
MP101520	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 bummer! My nail polish is starting
to peel!
MP101521	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hey	 is there a salon around here? Aah...
I guess not.
MP101522	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	This is such a BK. Oh	 that's short
for buzzkill!
MP101540	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wanna get dolled up tonight and head to
Ginz' for some yummy soosh?
MP101541	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	It's important to treat yourself now and then!
You gotta stay fresh.
MP101542	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 then we could belt our hearts out
to some bangers down in Shibs!
MP101560	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Morning! How're you doing	
{NAME2}-chan?
MP101561	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	My skin has NOT been feeling it today. It's
kind of lame	 not gonna lie!
MP101562	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Plus the charms on my cell are falling off!
Like	 OMG	 WTF!
MP101564	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hah! You're always so funny	
{NAME2}-chan!
MP101565	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	All right	 it's time to switch gears! Time to
get groovy!
MP101580	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hey	 we gotta talk! Me and my hubby got
into an argument the other day.
MP101581	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	We both got sooo PO'd that we didn't talk
to each other for	 like	 two full days!
MP101582	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But we couldn't keep that up forever	 so
when I went to tell him how sorry I was...
MP101583	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	...I found out he'd only gone and bought
me my favorite cake!
MP101585	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I was this close to falling right back in
love with him	 for realsies!
MP101600	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hey	 {NAME2}-chan? Are you like	
actually super popular or something?
MP101601	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Sometimes I see you talking to people and
it's like	 where are you even from?
MP101603	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Wow	 are you sure you're a high schooler	
{NAME2}-chan? You need to seriously
take a chill pill.
MP101604	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Then again	 I guess people might see me
and think	 "Who's that cute tanned chick?"
Right?
MP101620	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hey	 so be real with me. Do you have
a GF right now	 {NAME2}-chan?
MP101622	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	What	 are you embarrassed? You don't have
to hide it from me!
MP101623	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I'm sure you must have a lady friend or two!
MP101624	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I think it's great! Get out there and fall
in love while you're young	 y'know?
MP101625	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	I met my hubby pretty early in life	
you know.
MP101626	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But if we'd met just a little later	 I woulda
been loving it up all over the place!
MP101628	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Whaaat? You're so innocent	
{NAME2}-chan!
MP101629	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	But listen	 I'm always here to give love
advice! Just leave it to moi!
MP101700	AAAAAA==	Hello!
MP101701	AAAAAA==	Wait	 did you injure your hand?
MP101702	AAAAAA==	Even if you're feeling fine now	 don't get
carried away and hurt yourself	 okay?
MP101720	AAAAAA==	I'm really impressed by how accomplished
everyone here is.
MP101721	AAAAAA==	I should follow their example	 y'know?
Like help out with my dad's shop more.
MP101722	AAAAAA==	And study more... Mostly study more...
Really study more...
MP101723	AAAAAA==	*sigh* Maybe someone here can tutor me?
MP101740	AAAAAA==	Hmm... Do you think alcohol is really
that tasty?
MP101741	AAAAAA==	Dad and the regulars drink it every night
like it's really delicious or something...
MP101742	AAAAAA==	Just to be clear	 I've never had alcohol.
Not even a sip!
MP101743	AAAAAA==	No drinking until age twenty	 no sir!
MP101760	AAAAAA==	Little kids really have so much energy!
MP101761	AAAAAA==	I was playing tag with them at the park	 and
we were running for an hour straight!
MP101763	AAAAAA==	Hehe	 well	 it was nice to get some
real exercise in.
MP101764	AAAAAA==	I am exhausted	 though!
MP101780	AAAAAA==	I was watching TV with the usual kids
a while back...
MP101781	AAAAAA==	They were running all around the room	
and making a huge ruckus too.
MP101782	AAAAAA==	But the second cartoons were on the
screen	 they'd stop in their tracks
instantly!
MP101783	AAAAAA==	I swear they didn't move an inch until that
show was over.
MP101785	AAAAAA==	I could see the sparkle in their eyes! They
were really cute	 actually!
MP101800	AAAAAA==	My school friends recommended this foreign
TV drama	 and I binge watched the
whole thing.
MP101801	AAAAAA==	It was interesting	 but then the story got
so heavy it was hard to watch...
MP101802	AAAAAA==	The ending was so hopeless and depressing
it actually left a bad taste in my mouth.
MP101803	AAAAAA==	Guess it wasn't really for me.
MP101805	AAAAAA==	Yeah... I never really thought about it	 but
I'd say I prefer bright and uplifting stories.
MP101806	AAAAAA==	Something with a lot of laughs	 and a little
something heartwarming at the end.
MP101807	AAAAAA==	Say	 do you know any good shows or movies
like that?
MP101820	AAAAAA==	The neighborhood kids are staying over
at my place this weekend.
MP101821	AAAAAA==	What kind of food do you think little kids
would want?
MP101823	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that makes sense! The kind of stuff
you'd see on a kids' menu!
MP101824	AAAAAA==	My dad always wants to serve the kids
pickles from his shop.
MP101825	AAAAAA==	They might go well with sake	 but I don't
think little kids would find them tasty...
MP101827	AAAAAA==	Hmm... I guess that is an option.
MP101828	AAAAAA==	It's not really for me to decide what those
kids will or won't eat.
MP101829	AAAAAA==	But I do want to try and make something
they'd like	 regardless of what my dad says.
MP101830	AAAAAA==	Oh	 why don't you come? You can eat with
us too!
MP101900	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So this is the fortress of the
chosen ones...
MP101901	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	It's truly splendid	 {NAME1}-san. As a
kindred spirit	 I am truly proud of you!
MP101902	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Now that we've secured our base	 we must
prepare to face the threat!
MP101920	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	To be honest with you	 I've always wanted a
secret base.
MP101921	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Somewhere your parents can't just barge in
and make you clean up	 you know?
MP101922	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Do you think we could add a book corner?
That way	 we could really strengthen
our noggins.
MP101940	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Feel free to reach out if you ever need me.
MP101941	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	As a kindred spirit	 I vow to always stand
by you.
MP101942	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Remember	 you're never alone! As long as
I'm still standing	 at least.
MP101960	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I know this is a bit out of nowhere	 but do
you read much	 {NAME1}-san?
MP101962	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I see. I personally consider myself an
avid reader.
MP101963	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	If writing is the greatest human invention	
books must embody our species' sapience!
MP101980	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 do you read
light novels at all?
MP101982	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I see. I read a fair number of them myself.
Libraries stock them these days.
MP101983	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Sadly	 there are some that are prejudiced
against light novels based on their genre
and cover art.
MP101984	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	To those people I would like to say	 please	
let go of your preconceptions and try one!
MP102000	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 when buying books	
do you prefer physical or digital?
MP102002	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I see. I was a staunch believer of
paperbacks myself...
MP102003	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But now I'm running out of space and my
parents want me to get rid of them.
MP102004	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	With that in mind	 having them all on an
app makes it way more convenient. I can
read anywhere!
MP102005	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	However	 I still love flicking the pages by
hand! And the smell of old books
is wonderful!
MP102006	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 but if I go digital	 I can get new books
the minute they come out!
MP102007	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Ahh	 I can't seem to decide...
MP102020	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san	 do you ever read
parallel world novels?
MP102022	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I see. I read a good few myself. You don't
have to worry about running out of them
either. The genre is seemingly endless.
MP102023	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	The stories tend to follow a template	 so
you know what you're getting.
MP102024	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Usually the protagonist dies	 is reborn in
another world and becomes OP.
MP102025	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	On the other hand	 when you pick up a book
you know nothing about	 it might not go well.
MP102026	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Say	 the story takes a depressing turn	 or
there's a sudden tragic ending.
MP102027	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Which is fine if you're going in prepared
for that kind of story!
MP102028	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	But if I'm reading something to have a good
time	 why break my heart!?
MP102029	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Were they trying to betray my expectations?
Well	 now I don't expect ANYTHING from them!
MP102031	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Right! I-I apologize. I got too excited.
MP102032	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	My point is	 the appeal of parallel world
stories is the promise of certain victory.
MP102033	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Especially for us chosen ones	 for our own
battle guarantees no such promise.
MP102100	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh? Are you free	 Sensei?
MP102101	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Lucky me	 then.
MP102102	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'd appreciate if you could help me out.
You see	 there's a word I've been
wondering about...
MP102120	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Ah	 Sensei. Fancy bumping into you here.
MP102121	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 right. I'd like you to lend me an ear.
MP102122	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I can't	 for the life of me	 come up with the
right gift to give to a friend.
MP102123	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I just know you'd know waaay better
than I would!
MP102140	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Sensei! Sudden	 I know	 but do you like
brown sugar syrup or vinegar and soy sauce
for tokoroten noodles?
MP102141	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even in China	 we have more gelatin-based
sweets than you can shake your stick at.
MP102142	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Tokoroten noodles may have the completely
opposite flavor profile	 but they taste
simple yet profound.
MP102160	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 Sensei. Your timing never ceases
to amaze me.
MP102161	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The honorific prefix in Japanese can be
pronounced as both "o" and "go	 right?
MP102162,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I can't make tails or heads of how to
figure out which to use...
MP102164,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Hmm... I see. I feel like I'm getting closer
to understanding but am still oh so far away.
MP102165,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Anyway, I guess I'll just have to hit the
books. I'll do my best!
MP102180,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I just realized that daikon radishes in Japan
are really big.
MP102181,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,At first I thought it might be tough and
tasteless, but that's not the case.
MP102182,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,You usually cook for yourself, right? What
do you make with it?
MP102184,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Mmm-mmm, good. It sounds like an
essential item on the Japanese dining table!
MP102185,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,I enjoy daikon radish in oden or paired with
miso, but one day I'd like to try
pickled takuan.
MP102186,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Pickling it myself seems like a hassle, but
it's all about the experience, right?
MP102200,Yaol<#000000,i,#FFFFFF>ng Li,Eating gyoza with rice is such a Japanese
thing. It's what pops into a lot of Chinese
people's minds when you hear Japan."
MP102201	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	The yakisoba pan sold at the convenience
stores are quite the spectacle	 too.
MP102203	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh yeah. At this point	 who even knows
what's a main dish and what's a side?
MP102204	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But I wouldn't say I dislike that side of the
culinary experience here.
MP102205	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Sure	 traditional Japanese food steeped in
history is also great...
MP102206	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But	 no matter the combo	 only your tongue
can be the judge! I think that's wonderful.
MP102220	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 Sensei. I received a care package from
my parents	 and it was full of scrumptious
tea.
MP102221	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I want to share it with you since you've
done so much for me.
MP102222	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Do you like white or black tea?
MP102224	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Well	 white is made from only the new buds
of the plant	 and it's light and refreshing.
MP102225	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	On the other hand	 black is fermented over
many years and has a strong taste and aroma.
MP102226	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But it's probably quicker to just try them
than to listen to me explain.
MP102227	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'll make some for you on my next day off.
We can brew both and do a taste test!
MP102228	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	In that case	 it would be good to have both
heavy and light snacks...
MP102229	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Please find some sweets that you think will
go well with it	 Sensei!
MP102250	AAAAAA==	Oh	 wow	 look at you. That suits you nicely.
MP102251	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh...! Th-Thank you so much! I've been as
busy as a bee lately with celebrations
and such...
MP102252	AAAAAA==	Mmm-hmm	 I see. You should make the most of
wearing stunning outfits like that while
you're young.
MP102253	AAAAAA==	There are some styles that you can only
get away with at your age.
MP102254	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	So now's my chance	 huh. As someone with
experience beyond my years	 I'll be sure to
take your advice to heart.
MP102255	AAAAAA==	That said	 I'm not saying that fashion no
longer matters once you get older.
MP102256	AAAAAA==	Someday	 you'll reach the age when your
aesthetic will also mature like fine wine.
MP102257	AAAAAA==	I don't want to become a miserable old wretch
who has no motivation to do anything.
MP102259	AAAAAA==	Thank you	 but don't go trying to butter
me up.
MP102260	AAAAAA==	If you've got compliments to spare	 maybe
you should throw a few her way?
MP102261	AAAAAA==	You'd have better luck with her than with me.
MP102263	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 no	 Sensei. There's no need to start
fussing over me all of a sudden.
MP102264	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	But hearing what Chizuko-san has to say
makes me feel a whole lot better.
MP102265	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	There are so many kind people here
in Japan...
MP102266	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Even if they don't always express themselves
all that clearly.
MP102267	AAAAAA==	Is that so? Well	 I'm the type to just say
what's on my mind.
MP102268	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I'm happy to hear that. Plus	 it's also a
great opportunity to learn. Please	 tell
me more!
MP102275	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Oh	 welcome... I mean	 hello	
{NAME2}-kun and Yaoling.
MP102276	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You're in college	 aren't you	 Yaoling? Are
cocktails popular with the kids in China?
MP102277	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Actually	 I found a rather interesting recipe
that uses Chinese wines such as Shaoxing...
MP102279	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	That's right. I came here to study abroad
right after graduating from high school.
MP102280	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I come from Sichuan	 which is famous for
making a strong alcoholic drink called
baijiu.
MP102281	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Unfortunately	 I'm still not allowed
to drink.
MP102282	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I see. Well	 that can't be helped.
MP102283	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Ah... But you like tea	 don't you? I think
{NAME2}-kun mentioned that before.
MP102284	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Yes. Actually	 I'm making an effort to try
many things	 not just tea and the usual
stuff they sell here.
MP102285	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Kyushu's kuma tea	 Okinawa's sanpin tea
made with Jasmine leaves...
MP102286	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Great	 that might work. I could make you
a non-alcoholic cocktail	 or a "mocktail"
in other words.
MP102287	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	There are a lot of recipes that use tea
as a base with added fruit or mint.
MP102288	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I think both you and Yaoling will be able
to enjoy this one	 {NAME2}-kun.
MP102290	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Oh	 I see. Rather than a substitute for
alcohol	 it's a new way to drink tea for me.
MP102291	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	I would love to try it to see how it captures
the true essence of the tea's flavor!
MP102292	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Okay	 got it. I'll keep the ingredients in
stock so I can make it whenever.
MP102293	Yaol<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ng Li	Thanks to you	 Yuumi-san	 I'm expanding
my horizons more than ever before!
MP102300	AAAAAA==	Hey	 fancy meeting you here.
MP102301	AAAAAA==	Are you hungry by any chance?
MP102302	AAAAAA==	Want to go get something to eat once
you're done here?
MP102320	AAAAAA==	This is such an unusual place.
MP102321	AAAAAA==	Something about it is calming	 though.
It really feels very "you" in here.
MP102322	AAAAAA==	Oh	 wait. That came out weird.
MP102340	AAAAAA==	I noticed there were other people here	
so I thought about talking to them	 but...
MP102341	AAAAAA==	How do I break the ice?
MP102342	AAAAAA==	I don't want to screw up my first impression
and make them think I'm an antisocial weirdo.
MP102360	AAAAAA==	Did you know that flowers can have both
positive and negative meanings?
MP102361	AAAAAA==	For example	 what do you think yellow casa
blanca lilies represent?
MP102363	AAAAAA==	That's exactly right. I'm impressed.
MP102364	AAAAAA==	Actually	 yellow casa blancas can symbolize
both joy and betrayal.
MP102365	AAAAAA==	Some often take them for the latter meaning	
so it's said they don't make for good
gifts	 but...
MP102366	AAAAAA==	I wish that more people would see them for
their positive meaning.
MP102380	AAAAAA==	So	 about the language of flowers...
MP102381	AAAAAA==	Did you know that according to the language
of flowers	 a watermelon means "thick
and heavy"?
MP102382	AAAAAA==	I guess it's more influenced by its fruit
than its flower.
MP102383	AAAAAA==	Watermelon flowers are these cute and tiny
little things.
MP102385	AAAAAA==	You think so?
MP102386	AAAAAA==	Hmm	 now that I'm hearing it from you	
maybe you are right!
MP102400	AAAAAA==	As far as a flower that matches its
meaning perfectly goes	 do you know what
coffee means?
MP102401	AAAAAA==	Coffee flowers mean "let's take a break."
MP102402	AAAAAA==	Coffee's the perfect thing when you want
to relax for a moment	 right?
MP102403	AAAAAA==	Oh	 that reminds me. I found a great coffee
shop the other day.
MP102404	AAAAAA==	Would you like to go?
MP102406	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 of course!
MP102407	AAAAAA==	Oh	 and since I'm the one who invited you	
I'll take care of the bill.
MP102420	AAAAAA==	You can borrow my book about the origin of
the language of flowers if you want.
MP102421	AAAAAA==	Customers ask about their meanings all the
time when you work at a florist.
MP102422	AAAAAA==	I think it wouldn't hurt if you went ahead
and learned some of them.
MP102424	AAAAAA==	Oh... Then I can teach you myself when
there's downtime at work.
MP102425	AAAAAA==	That'd be okay	 right?
MP102426	AAAAAA==	If that's the case	 I'd better brush up on
my studies myself.
MP102427	AAAAAA==	I can't be giving you wrong information	
after all.
MP102440	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	...And that's when I knew my opponent had
no way of turning the tables!
MP102441	AAAAAA==	I see	 I see.
MP102442	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	So I leaned in and told them...
MP102443	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Too bad, but that was your final turn!
MP102444	AAAAAA==	Wow	 that's so cool!
MP102446	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh	 it's nothing serious. Just telling
Ashiya-san about some of my old battles.
MP102447	AAAAAA==	Kurotani-kun says he's good at card games.
MP102448	AAAAAA==	Apparently the goddess of victory loves him
so much that she even grants him the power
of destiny.
MP102449	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Well	 it's what you might call my
destiny draw.
MP102450	AAAAAA==	Oh	 I've heard of that one before. I play
a lot of card games myself.
MP102451	AAAAAA==	I'd love to play against you some time. When
would you be free?
MP102452	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Huh?
MP102453	AAAAAA==	You'd rather not?
MP102454	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No	 it's just... It'd be rude for a
first-year student like me to challenge
a third-year.
MP102455	AAAAAA==	Really? I don't think so.
MP102456	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I-If the two of us face off like this	 I'm
not sure my destiny powers will really
activate...
MP102457	AAAAAA==	Huh? Oh	 I get it! I'm sorry! Yeah	 you'd
start feeling nervous!
MP102458	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Oh! I-I know	 why don't the three of us play?
We can find a time that works	 and‚Äî
MP102459	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Yeah	 that'll give me time to prepare... Er	
not that destiny requires preparation!
MP102460	AAAAAA==	Great idea! You're right	 it'd be more fun if
all three of us played together!
MP102500	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	You know how some places are quite busy	
yet surprisingly cozy and welcoming?
MP102501	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Whenever I come across a spot like that	
I start to picture it as a nice little
reading nook...
MP102502	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I wonder why...
MP102520	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Hmmm...
MP102521	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 I'm sorry. I was just thinking
about something.
MP102522	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Whenever you find a spot to relax	 the
thoughts just bubble right up	 don't they?
MP102540	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I always get nervous when strangers
approach me looking to start a
conversation...
MP102541	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	But everyone here is so nice	 I feel much
more comfortable.
MP102542	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Maybe I should try being the one to approach
them sometime?
MP102560	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Hmm... I don't know...
MP102562	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 yes... I received a box of mini cakes
from some relatives recently.
MP102563	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I appreciate the gesture but	 with my dietary
restrictions	 there's no way I can eat them.
MP102564	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I'm not sure what the best course of
action is.
MP102580	Koto<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>e Montagne	I've been getting a lot of requests for
autographs lately.
MP102582	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Hrm... I'd like to oblige you	 I promise.
MP102583	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	But	 I don't really have a proper	
distinctive autograph.
MP102584	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I've always just written my name in cursive
as best I could...
MP102585	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I feel like people will be disappointed with
something so plain-looking.
MP102586	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Say	 what kind of style do you think would
be good for an autograph?
MP102600	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	There's something I've noticed while chatting
with people here...
MP102601	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	The things figure skaters think of as common
knowledge aren't actually very widely known.
MP102603	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Hm	 like for example...
MP102604	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	The edge of your skates' blade... You know	
the part that touches the ice?
MP102605	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Well	 it's not flat	 and it's not sharp like
a regular blade either.
MP102606	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	It's indented in an arch shape in the middle!
You'll see if you look at one yourself.
MP102607	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	You set your weight on one side of the arch
to turn when you skate into a curve.
MP102608	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Did you know that?
MP102620	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	*sigh*
MP102622	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 {NAME2}-kun... No	 it's
nothing like that.
MP102623	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I passed some girls earlier who were
discussing their favorite caf√©s.
MP102624	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	They just kept talking about which cakes
go best with coffee.
MP102625	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	And they all just sounded so good... *sigh*
MP102626	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I really do love sweets. Like the little ones
my coach gives me as a reward from time
to time.
MP102627	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	But you have to keep to a very strict diet
to be a figure skater.
MP102628	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Ah... I wish I could taste all those
different cakes	 too.
MP102630	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 yes! We should absolutely do that
when we get the chance!
MP102700	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I haven't had much time to relax at home
because a competition is coming up.
MP102701	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	A lapse in concentration is the last thing
I want while I'm performing...
MP102702	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I'll need to rest whenever I can.
MP102720	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	It's pretty tough when I need to study for
tests and practice skating at the same time.
MP102721	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	The school is flexible when it comes to my
competition schedule	 but still...
MP102722	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I need to study more efficiently... *yawn*...
MP102740	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I was out running an errand near the
movie theater in Yongen-Jaya the
other day.
MP102741	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Did you know there are batting cages nearby?
MP102742	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	They're up a flight of narrow stairs.
I couldn't believe it when I found them.
MP102743	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Why don't we go there together sometime?
MP102760	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	A classical piece I recognized started
playing in a video on my feed.
MP102761	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	But I just can't remember the name. It's on
the tip of my tongue...
MP102763	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 wow! I didn't know you could search
for it like that!
MP102764	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Although I'm always using my phone	 I never
knew that was possible!
MP102780	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Hmmm...
MP102781	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Maybe I'm just not photogenic...
MP102783	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I was running out of pages in my passport	
so I got it renewed the other day.
MP102784	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I took an ID photo for it	 but...
MP102785	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	The way it came out	 I barely recognize the
person I'm looking at.
MP102786	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Does that happen to anyone else?
MP102800	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I've been drinking lemon-flavored soda water
after practice lately.
MP102801	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	But I couldn't believe it when I saw all the
other flavors they make online.
MP102802	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Pineapple	 strawberry	 green apple...
They all sound delicious.
MP102804	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	We should try them together some time. I'd
like to sample lots of different flavors.
MP102805	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Apparently they used to say that drinking
carbonated water was bad for you...
MP102806	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	But my sports physician said it was all about
when and how much you drink.
MP102807	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Lately some people even say it's good for
you	 but apparently drinking too much can
negatively impact your health.
MP102808	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	When it comes to enjoying food and drink	
it's important to be aware of what you're
really putting into your body.
MP102820	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I get lots of flower bouquets from my fans
at the end of a competition.
MP102821	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Getting flowers really does lift one's heart	
don't you think?
MP102823	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Well... Lately I have had trouble knowing
what to do with all the flowers I've been
getting.
MP102824	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I decorate my home with them	 or place them
by the entrance to the skating rink...
MP102825	AAAAAA==	But these days I get so many I've run out of
places to display them.
MP102826	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I just can't bring myself to toss them out
before they start to wilt	 though...
MP102827	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	I wonder if there's something I can do
with them?
MP102829	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Good idea... It's not very common to find
yourself overwhelmed with flowers.
MP102830	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Maybe taking up a new hobby so as to not
waste them is a good idea.
MP102860	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Ah... Those clothes are so lovely! I wish I
had your fashion sense!
MP102861	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Hehe	 thank you.
MP102862	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 {NAME2}-kun!
MP102863	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Word up! We were just talking about
Kotone-chan's sense of style!
MP102864	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	She just showed me her competition costumes
on her phone too...
MP102865	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Can you believe these? They're so rad!
She's like fashion incarnate!
MP102867	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Thanks. I'll let my designer know next time
I see them.
MP102868	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	You must hire some super-famous designer
considering your level	 right?
MP102869	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 no	 I go to the same specialty shop in
Kichijoji that I've always used.
MP102870	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Kichijoji... Wait	 could you mean the store
that's near the jazz bar?
MP102871	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	You know it?
MP102873	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	That designer is super talented! Anyone who's
in the know has heard of them.
MP102874	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	They're	 like	 my idol! No wonder you look
so amazing!
MP102875	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Oh	 I never knew they were so famous!
MP102876	K<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tone Montagne	Wait	 so how old are they now? They looked
to be only in their thirties at most...
MP102900	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Feels like a secret base for a team of
superheroes. Not bad.
MP102901	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	All that's missing are the boarding gates for
everyone's personalized mech.
MP102902	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You'll be the red ranger	 right {NAME1}?
I want to be blue or black then!
MP102920	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Red's not really my favorite ranger color	
actually.
MP102921	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Red's usually the main hero	 sure	 but
I think support roles like Blue are
really cool.
MP102922	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	A rival role like a Black Ranger's real
rad too!
MP102940	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Action scenes are where stuntmen shine	 so
I want to build up my stamina.
MP102941	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Could I use this place for running or
weightlifting? You wouldn't get mad	
would you?
MP102942	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Okay then... I'll just think up names for my
moves instead. How's Justice Blast sound?
MP102960	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	What's your favorite type of live-action
hero	 {NAME1}-kun?
MP102961	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Heroes that fight together as a team of
rangers	 or ones that bash heads solo?
MP102963	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Cool! I don't think I could pick one over
the other	 personally.
MP102964	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	The idea of fighting evil alongside your
comrades gets me real excited.
MP102965	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But there's plenty to admire of an unnamed
hero who battles on alone with no one to
cheer them on!
MP102966	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I do think you're more of a Red Ranger than
anything else.
MP102967	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You're quiet	 but I can picture you leading
your friends in battle	 y'know?
MP102980	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	The outfits live-action rangers have to wear
can be so tight	 every contour of their
bodies can be seen.
MP102981	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	That means they can't get too fat or too
skinny	 since they all wear the same suits.
MP102982	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But there are times when the show looks for
more diverse actors of different builds
or height.
MP102983	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Some roles require a tall actor or a short
one	 y'know?
MP102984	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Back in the day	 there weren't a lot of
female live-action rangers	 right?
MP102985	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	So back then	 a lot of female characters
were just played by short men!
MP102987	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You'd never know if someone didn't tell
you	 right? That's the charm of the stuntman
behind the mask!
MP102988	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	In my case I'm of average height and build	
so I don't really stand out there...
MP102989	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But you could also say it makes me versatile.
I could fit a lot of different roles.
MP103010	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	{NAME1}-kun	 have you ever seen
Shichi-kun in Shibuya?
MP103012	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	It really makes an impression	 huh?
Definitely caught me off guard the first
time I saw it.
MP103013	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But actually	 I'm more interested in the
person inside that suit.
MP103014	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Not just anyone can move and perform like
that in that kind of outfit!
MP103015	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Maybe it's actually a famous actor...
I'd love to talk to them sometime.
MP103016	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But	 even as an aspiring costumed stuntman	
I can't just talk to them if they're on
the job.
MP103017	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	So if you ever hear anything about
Shichi-kun's actor	 fill me in	 okay?
MP103030	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	You know	 you're a pretty mysterious guy.
MP103032	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Sorry	 it just slipped out. I didn't mean it
in a bad way though.
MP103033	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	A lot of people say I'm not the kind of
person I look like... in a bad way	 y'know.
MP103034	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	It gets really annoying. I end up expecting
the same reaction from everyone.
MP103035	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I thought that you might be similar to me
in that way.
MP103036	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But you're always acting natural. You don't
put yourself down to praise others.
MP103037	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I think that's... I guess I'm kind of
jealous	 to be honest.
MP103039	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	See	 that's exactly what I'm talking about!
Ugh	 I can't win.
MP103040	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Anyway	 I think what I'm trying to say is...
I'm glad we're friends.
MP103041	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	So I'm looking forward to seeing where
our future ventures take us	 {NAME1}!
MP103060	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	The aura I sense from you... It's very
similar to that of a chosen one.
MP103061	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	A chosen one? Yeah	 I wanted to be something
like that once.
MP103062	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	But I found a goal for myself in this world	
so... I guess I wasn't special.
MP103063	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I see. However	 I still perceive radiance
from you even in this state.
MP103065	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san! Please	 try to match
the tone of the conversation!
MP103066	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Haha! You're fun. {NAME1}-kun always
keeps good company	 I guess!
MP103067	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	No	 no	 I should be saying that. Wait	 could
you be... another kindred spirit?
MP103068	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	A kindred spirit	 huh? I like it! I'd love to
join your group!
MP103069	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Of course! Even if you aren't a chosen one	
we can still face our battles together.
MP103070	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Thanks. I wish I'd met you and
{NAME1}-kun earlier.
MP103071	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	Hah! It's not too late yet. Time is on our
side	 after all.
MP103073	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	{NAME1}-san! Please	 you're supposed
to be our intermediary! Your job is to
introduce us to each other!
MP103074	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	We've made it this far into the conversation	
but we still don't know each other's names!
MP103075	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	Haha	 that's true!
MP103076	Leo K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>miyama	I'm Leo Kamiyama	 currently in training to
become a costumed stuntman! Nice to
meet you.
MP103077	Kiyoshi Kur<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>tani	I'm	 uh	 Kiyoshi Kurotani... currently a
chosen one.
MP103100	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Hello	 {NAME1}-san.
MP103101	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	There seems to be quite the number of
people here. Do you know them all?
MP103102	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I have much to learn from your example.
I'll need to apply myself to be more
sociable.
MP103120	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Ah	 {NAME1}-san. How are you doing?
MP103121	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I've been feeling slightly tired as of late	
but I'm making do with some ginger and honey.
MP103122	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I recommend a mixture of honey and lemon
on toast. I'm sure you'll find it to satisfy
your cravings in many delightful ways!
MP103123	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Oh... What am I going on about? In any case	
I just wanted to say	 I highly recommend
honey.
MP103140	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Some stop eating when they find themselves
busy	 while others eat more to relieve
stress.
MP103141	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The question of how to defeat both calories
and stress is an eternal one.
MP103142	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The temptation of something sweet when I'm
tired is quite something. It's a battle
I fight daily.
MP103160	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Oh	 {NAME1}-san. I'd like to speak
with you.
MP103161	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I saw someone who went to "borrow" an
umbrella during a sudden shower.
MP103162	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	When I pointed out that they may be
committing theft	 they froze up...
MP103163	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Were my words too harsh?
MP103165	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I suppose you're right... It's not always
about being correct.
MP103166	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	It made me realize I need to be more flexible
in my thinking and careful with my words.
MP103180	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The term "modus operandi" refers to the
trademark behavior of a criminal that can
be used to link them to multiple crimes.
MP103181	Yukimi Fuji<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>awa	Outside the legal system	 people tend to
use "MO" casually to refer to their habits
and guilty pleasures.
MP103182	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	But given its original meaning	 I can't help
but feel taken aback when people use it
like that.
MP103183	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Do you have any similar phrases that make
you feel that way?
MP103185	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Ah	 yes. There are many terms and phrases
mistakenly used in that way as well.
MP103186	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	One usually hesitates to correct others
about them	 though. You just have to stew
on it.
MP103200	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The word "faith" means to believe and trust
in something that may not be based on proof.
MP103201	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Yet the legal concept of "good faith" means
to uphold a standard of honesty and integrity
when dealing with others.
MP103202	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Good faith and fair dealing also extends to
third parties too.
MP103204	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I agree. But this is the sort of knowledge we
need to work matters out between people.
MP103205	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Everyone may wish to call themselves good	
but its definition varies greatly from person
to person.
MP103206	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	The concept may seem uncaring at first	 but
in reality	 it helps us respect one another.
MP103220	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	At times	 I'll compare my way of thinking
to those of others.
MP103221	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	It makes me think that I'm too constrained
by insisting on formal correctness.
MP103222	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	But after having interacted with those who
come to different conclusions?
MP103223	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I now realize that some value only the ends	
while others value the means as well.
MP103224	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	That difference strikes me as something very
important in and of itself.
MP103226	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Heh heh. Yes	 something like that.
MP103227	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I enjoy speaking with you because you see
depths that I cannot...
MP103228	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I imagine it won't be long until I find a
conclusion I couldn't have reached alone.
MP103229	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I hope to be able to spend more time with
you for that to happen.
MP103250	AAAAAA==	My	 she seems awfully proper for someone
you know	 {NAME1}-kun.
MP103251	AAAAAA==	She kind of reminds me of a teacher I had in
middle school. She even gets me nervous.
MP103252	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I do get that from time to time	 yes...
MP103253	AAAAAA==	You know	 you might lose sight of what's
truly important if you're too by the book.
MP103254	AAAAAA==	Think you could relax a little more? At least
when you're around me?
MP103255	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	What's truly important... Indeed	 you may
be correct.
MP103256	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I'm glad to hear your thoughts. I shall
strive to keep it in mind going forward.
MP103258	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Heh heh heh. I'm sorry. It was just a
refreshing lesson to receive...
MP103259	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	I spoke that way intentionally because I
thought it'd be amusing. My apologies.
MP103260	AAAAAA==	......
MP103261	AAAAAA==	Huh	 okay then. I think you'll be just fine.
MP103262	AAAAAA==	You have a lot going on inside. It's not
like you're putting on a fake mask.
MP103263	AAAAAA==	You don't seem to be unconsciously trying
to act like some authority	 either.
MP103264	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Are you sure? I do feel as though I am
putting up quite a front...
MP103265	AAAAAA==	Well	 anyone's gonna be a bit wary talking
to an old lady like me.
MP103266	AAAAAA==	In any case	 let me correct what I said at
the start here.
MP103267	AAAAAA==	You're no ordinary girl. Just like someone
I'd expect {NAME1}-kun to know.
MP103269	Y<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>kimi Fujikawa	Should I take that as a compliment? I do
feel as if you've given me some form
of approval.
MP103270	AAAAAA==	I am. No need to feel intimidated. Take my
words however you like.
MP103300	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	{NAME2}! I don't know where
we are	 but it looks fun!
MP103301	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Let's explore together!
MP103302	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I wonder what mysteries await us?
I'm so excited!
MP103320	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hrmmm...
MP103321	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'm thinking up a hard quiz.
MP103322	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Once it's ready	 you'll be my first
contestant	 {NAME2}!
MP103340	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Perspective is key to solving a puzzle
or quiz.
MP103341	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Simply changing your mindset can spark
totally new ideas!
MP103342	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	If you're stuck	{NAME2}	 try thinking
outside the box!
MP103360	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	{NAME2}	 do you know the story
of Shibuya's Buchiko?
MP103362	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Yes	 that one! Rumor has it that...
MP103363	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	The statue takes walkies in the middle
of the night! Is it true?
MP103364	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I want to see for myself	 but Mom said I'm
not allowed to roam about outside when
it's dark.
MP103365	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So	 I want you to check out Buchiko at
night for me!
MP103380	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	{NAME2}	 does your school
have clubs?
MP103382	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Lucky! My elementary school doesn't have any.
MP103383	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	If we did	 I'd join the Explorer Club!
MP103384	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Oh	 I know! Since we don't have one	 I'll
make my own!
MP103385	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Will you join my Explorer Club	 {NAME2}?
MP103400	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	{NAME2}	 do you know
Shibuya's Shichi-kun?
MP103402	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	So you do know! Isn't Shichi-kun the cutest?
MP103403	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	It always waves when my friends and I
are exploring!
MP103404	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Shichi-kun doesn't even mind Kyo-kun's
punches and kicks!
MP103405	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Still	 Shichi-kun is full of mysteries.
MP103406	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	And someday	 I will uncover them all!
MP103410	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Hey	 hey! {NAME2}	 what's your
school like?
MP103412	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Wow! I'd love to go there!
MP103413	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But after elementary school	 I'll be
attending college in America.
MP103414	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I guess we won't get to go to
school together...
MP103416	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Wait	 really!? Yaaay!
MP103417	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Actually	 I'm kinda scared to go to the US.
MP103418	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	But if I have you	{NAME2}	
I'll be just fine!
MP103420	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	*stare*
MP103421	AAAAAA==	......
MP103422	AAAAAA==	Hey	 {NAME2}. Little help?
MP103424	AAAAAA==	Go get your eyes checked. I'll introduce you to an optometrist I know.
MP103425	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Are you a doctor	 mister?
MP103426	AAAAAA==	Well	 kind of. I'm still in residency.
MP103427	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	Amazing! Doctors have to study lots	 right?
MP103428	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'm Haruna	 and I love studying	 but I don't
think I have what it takes...
MP103429	AAAAAA==	Haruna? As in Haruna Nishimori?
MP103430	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	That's me! You've heard of me before?
MP103431	AAAAAA==	My work is buzzing about the kid genius
Haruna Nishimori.
MP103432	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I'm no genius.
Doctors are way cooler!
MP103433	AAAAAA==	Look at you	 charming your way to making
a friend like that.
MP103434	Haruna Nishim<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ri	I can't believe it	{NAME2}!
You're friends with a doctor!
MP103500	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 hello!
MP103501	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Umm...
MP103502	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Eheh... Never mind. I'm just happy to see
you is all!
MP103520	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmm... What part-time job should I try
out next?
MP103521	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Is there any place you'd recommend?
MP103522	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I don't mind hard work	 either! I'm stronger
than I look!
MP103523	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hee hee. It'd be nice if we got the chance
to work together again	 too.
MP103540	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	This is a strange place.
MP103541	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's somehow exciting and relaxing at
the same time...
MP103542	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I wonder why.
MP103560	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey	 {NAME1}-kun	 what's your
favorite kind of cr√™pe?
MP103561	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Or	 what kind would you most like to eat
right now? Just curious about your tastes!
MP103563	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 I see	 nice! I could go for one of
those	 too!
MP103564	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe next time I work at a cr√™pe stand
I'll practice those	 just in case!
MP103580	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I get a little nervous whenever I talk to
people at work about sports.
MP103581	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's always awkward if it turns out our
favorite teams are rivals or something...
MP103582	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	But if I mention I used to play baseball	
they always ask what pro team I like!
MP103583	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	*sigh* I'm never sure how to answer when
that happens...
MP103585	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Yeah	 you're right. It's not like I support
teams just to get into fights over them.
MP103586	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Thanks.
I'll try doing that from now on.
MP103600	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmm... Maybe some adventure is just
what I need?
MP103601	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun	 I've got
a question...
MP103602	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Whenever you spot a strange-looking drink
in a vending machine	 do you buy it?
MP103604	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I see... I always end up going for the
safe option instead.
MP103605	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I do think it might make a fun story to try
a weird one	 but I never go through with it.
MP103606	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Next time I see it	 I'm definitely gonna try
that oyster sauce cider!
MP103620	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hey {NAME1}-kun	 so	 I've
got a question...
MP103621	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Which do you think are better	 glasses
or contacts?
MP103622	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've always worn glasses	 so I think I'd
feel kinda weird going out without them.
MP103623	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Anyway	 I just thought I'd ask for a
second opinion	 so...?
MP103625	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Really!? Y-You think so? Th-Then maybe
I'll go with that...
MP103626	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've been thinking about my style lately	
not just the glasses	 but like	 hair
and clothes...
MP103627	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I work at a bunch of places but	 well	 I've
known you for a while. Thoughts?
MP103629	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	You think so? Well	 um	 thanks...
MP103630	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehehe.
MP103650	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's gooo!
MP103651	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Let's gooo!
MP103653	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hi	 {NAME1}-kun!
MP103654	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Noge-san was just getting me hyped up!
MP103656	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Things have been kinda rough lately	 and I
was feeling down...
MP103657	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Then Noge-san came and asked me what
was wrong!
MP103658	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I know how it feels to be going through
a lot	 you know? So I had to reach out.
MP103659	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	We just talked a little about some of the
stuff we've both been through	 that's all.
MP103660	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	But speaking with Noge-san	 I realized
I don't have time to spend feeling down!
MP103661	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Which means I need some energy! Like a
good dose of hype!
MP103662	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So she asked me what I do when I need to
motivate myself	 and... well	 I take a deep
breath	 and shout...
MP103663	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's gooo!
MP103664	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Let's gooo!
MP103665	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Heck yeah	 that feels great! Why don't you
join us?
MP103666	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe	 good idea! C'mon	 {NAME1}-kun	
all together!
MP103667	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Let's gooo!
MP103700	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Did I have a little too much to drink?
MP103701	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	How did I end up falling asleep in a place
like this?
MP103702	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Then again	 the atmosphere's not bad.
It kind of reminds me of a jazz bar.
MP103720	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	At least this place doesn't seem to have
any wacky drunks around...
MP103721	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	No brutes looking for fights	 either. That's
a relief.
MP103722	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Once you're old enough to start drinking	 you
need to be careful about where you do it.
MP103723	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Also	 you should never get too drunk. Even if
you're drinking to forget.
MP103740	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Maybe to you my love for jazz might seem
like something you'd expect from someone
my age.
MP103741	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	But you know	 what they call pop music
today was at its height even when I was
a kid.
MP103742	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Jazz is like a true hobby to me. It's never
been about what's in fashion.
MP103760	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	It would've been sixty years ago when I was
around your age...
MP103761	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	Right around then	 the world started to
become a lot freer	 but also faced its fair
share of troubles too.
MP103762	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	But I'm not a fan of people telling me that
I turned out like this because of when I
was born.
MP103763	C<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao	You can't stand it when people say "all
youths act the same	 right?
MP103765,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Yeah, that's exactly it. You're pretty good
at firing back at someone.
MP103766,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You know, I bet even diversity and universal
principles come and go with the times.
MP103780,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,When I was young, people liked to get
dead drunk to show how they really felt.
MP103781,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,But are we really ourselves only after we
let loose with some alcohol?
MP103782,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Of course, I did start drinking back in
those days...
MP103783,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I'm not the classiest drinker, but it isn't
that easy to understand someone's true self.
MP103785,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Some drink to spit up what's bottled up
inside of them. Others drink to bottle
things up.
MP103786,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,People drink for different reasons.
I suppose alcohol
is a bit like a screwdriver.
MP103800,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Try to live nice and long until you're as
old as this granny here...
MP103801,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Watching the world change around you
isn't the worst feeling, you'll come to find.
MP103802,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I had a time when I thought it was cool to
buck authority and stick to my beliefs...
MP103803,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,But perhaps it's wiser to find a way to
compromise with others in a way that also
benefits yourself.
MP103804,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Live long enough to see it all and you won't
be a slave to your instincts.
MP103806,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Well, that's the tricky part. While you may
get a good view of the path ahead by
climbing a tree...
MP103807,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You gotta come down to walk it eventually.
That was the case for me as well.
MP103820,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I struggled a lot back in the day. There are
things I've gained and also lost...
MP103821,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Before I know it, I'm already a granny.
These days, there aren't many things
I still cling to obsessively.
MP103822,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,I think that's normal though. But now that
the world's a more prosperous place...
MP103823,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Young people these days just don't know what
they should yearn for. Must be difficult.
MP103824,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Others can't go and tell you to start wanting
things. That's not how desire works...
MP103826,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Oh yeah? You think I shouldn't kick back
and relax now that I'm retired, huh.
MP103827,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,If that's how you feel about it though, maybe
you're right.
MP103828,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,Okay, no need to hold back. You're gonna
help me out too, you know.
MP103829,C<#000000,h,#FFFFFF>izuko Nagao,You're okay with that, right? Then
let's start...
MP103900,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,{NAME2}-kun, do you mind if I practice
my flair tricks here?
MP103901,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,It goes without saying that I won't be
making actual cocktails, of course.
MP103902,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,And if I spill anything, I'll be sure to wipe
it right up. That's good with you, right?
MP103920,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,I'm trying to come up with a new cocktail
recipe but nothing's coming to mind.
MP103921,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,If I don't narrow things down a bit first,
the cost of ingredients can get quite high.
MP103922,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Also, if I keep tasting what I make, I'll end
up totally smashed by the end.
MP103923,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,And then the recipe gets lost to the ages.
All that hard work for nothing...
MP103940,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,The names they give to cocktails can be
pretty wild, don't you think?
MP103941,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Bloody Mary, Screwdriver, and the like...
MP103942,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,They all sound like wrestling moves.
Don't you just want to scream them out loud?
MP103960,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,The flair bartending that I do also includes
duo performances.
MP103961,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,So, why not give it a go with me,
{NAME2}-kun?
MP103963,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,I'm kidding! Sorry, I just thought it
wouldn't hurt to ask, that's all.
MP103964,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Everyone's going to get the wrong idea if I
were to do it with someone your age.
MP103965,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Maybe I'll ask you again when you're
a little older.
MP103980,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,Female bartenders are sometimes
called barmaids.
MP103981,Yu<#000000,m,#FFFFFF>i Shiina,I feel like in Japan, the word maid" has
a very strong image associated with it.
MP103982	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	When you hear "barmaid"	 doesn't a maid
outfit come to mind?
MP103984	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Huh? Are you saying you've got a thing
for maids	 {NAME2}-kun?
MP103985	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Wait	 does that mean there's demand for it?
Maybe a full-on maid bar could work...
MP103986	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	No! That's not gonna happen! Get your mind
out of the gutter!
MP104000	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The other day	 I saw a girl doing a puppet
performance on the street in Shinjuku.
MP104001	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	She was pretty young	 probably about your
age	 but her performance was beyond
her years!
MP104002	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Flair bartending is also a type of
performance	 so I found it really inspiring.
MP104004	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	It's not like we're competing directly. What
we do is very different.
MP104005	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	But	 seeing someone so young work hard
reminds me that I have to work hard too!
MP104006	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I wanted to give her a tip but I didn't have
any change on me.
MP104007	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	So I tossed her a ten thousand yen bill instead!
MP104008	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Not that I regret it or anything	 but now
this month's looking a little tough...
MP104020	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Are your parents strong drinkers	
{NAME2}-kun? Or are they lightweights?
MP104022	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Well	 some kids end up weak to alcohol
even with parents who drink a lot.
MP104023	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	The opposite can be true as well. Only time
will tell how you'll turn out.
MP104024	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	No worries though! Even if you're not the
drinking type...
MP104025	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	I can always whip up a mocktail! Drink with
me when you're of age	 okay?
MP104027	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	C'mon! No matter how I drunk I get	 I'll only
ever show you my cool side.
MP104028	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	You can bet on it! For sure...
I think? Maybe?
MP104029	Yu<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>i Shiina	Yeah... I might be a problem	 so I'll teach
you how to take care of me	 okay?
MP104100	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	The cost of living is so high these days!
MP104101	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Food	 electricity	 heating... No matter how
I try to cut costs	 it all keeps adding up.
MP104102	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Maybe... I could just live here instead?
MP104120	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I don't want to assume	 but...
MP104121	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Do you actually know everyone here?
MP104122	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	What incredible networking!
MP104140	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	This could be a good place to practice
with my marionettes!
MP104141	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Aaah	 but I'd get in the way if I tried to
set up all my stuff here	 though...
MP104142	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Guess I'll just practice in my head for now.
'Kay	 time to get in the zone.
MP104160	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Oh	 I get it!
I should try that...
MP104162	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I'm renting a room	 but recently I've picked
up so much stuff that it's getting pretty cramped.
MP104163	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	So I decided to look up videos on how best
to organize it all.
MP104164	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I'm gonna go buy a storage rack right
after work tomorrow!
MP104180	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Aaah... It's so nice to relax.
MP104181	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	My main job and side gig have both been
sooo exhausting lately.
MP104182	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	But when I decided to call it a day and let
myself unwind	 it's like all the fatigue
just melted awaaay.
MP104184	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Thank you!
MP104185	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Ah... But I think all this relaxing's making
me hungry.
MP104200	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Ah... What a calming space you have here!
MP104201	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	My room these days feels so tiny‚Äîit's been
forever since I've had space like this!
MP104202	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Say	 does this place have any beds?
MP104204	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I think it would definitely be better to
have some! You'd sleep so well here!
MP104205	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	It could also use a bath	 massage chairs	
maybe a manga-reading corner...
MP104220	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I'm usually putting on shows with my puppet
here	 but I've been thinking...
MP104221	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Maybe I should try some new type of
performance from time to time?
MP104222	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	What do you think would be good?
MP104224	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Oooh	 yes!
That's a great idea!
MP104225	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I could get a whole new outfit too. I'm sure
it'd be a huge hit!
MP104226	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Well	 if that's what I'm doing	 I'd better
plan it out right away!
MP104227	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	I love how easy it is to wanna try new things
when I'm with you!
MP104229	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>yu Sahara	Hee hee! Thank you! I hope you'll come
to all my shows!
MP104300	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Oh	 hey.
MP104301	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Feels like it's been ages	 but also like
we just met the other day.
MP104302	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	What's up with that?
MP104320	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I've noticed that you never fail to greet me
whenever we cross paths. You really are a
polite one.
MP104321	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Hmm	 but maybe having such a kind attitude
is what draws so many people to you?
MP104322	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I should watch and learn from your example.
MP104340	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Huh? You need something?
MP104341	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Not that you need to have a reason to talk
to me. I didn't mean it like that.
MP104342	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I'm just not the type to strike up
conversations with others	 so I thought you
were going to break some news to me.
MP104343	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	So... Did something happen?
MP104360	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	What should I do...?
MP104362	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Oh	 {NAME1}! Perfect timing.
MP104363	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I was just pondering what book to
read next...
MP104364	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Should I read a short story or push through
a good chunk of a longer novel?
MP104380	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Hey	 {NAME1}. People always tell me
I'm too serious.
MP104381	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	But	 is that a bad thing? Do people prefer it
when others aren't serious?
MP104383	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Right? I suppose it depends on the situation	
but I wouldn't even know where to even start.
MP104384	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	You should do what you think is right instead
of trying to please people and regretting it.
MP104385	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Thanks.
MP104400	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	You've got to check out this book!
MP104401	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	It's by an author I deeply respect‚Äîthe debut
novel of Toshia Soomy!
MP104402	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Anyway	 it's a really good read. And a new
edition came out	 so I had to upgrade!
MP104404	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Well	 the cover's different	 but the inside's
exactly the same.
MP104405	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	But I read my old copy so many times it's
falling apart.
MP104406	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I was already thinking of buying it again	
and then the new edition came out.
MP104407	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I knew it was meant to be	 so I bought
five copies.
MP104408	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Now I know I'll never have to worry about
the wear and tear!
MP104420	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Remember when I told you I bought five of
Toshia Soomy's books?
MP104421	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Since then	 other authors have re-released
their books with new cover designs.
MP104422	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I'm happy	 of course	 but... I'm also running
out of money.
MP104424	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	At this rate	 five of each is a bit too much
for my wallet	 so I'm settling for only three
for now.
MP104425	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	But that's when it dawned on me...
MP104426	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I used to be happy with just one copy. But
after buying five	 three just isn't enough.
MP104427	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	If one gets too worn out	 then I only have
two left...
MP104428	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Not that I regret buying those five copies.
MP104429	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	But I fear I might have ventured too far
into forbidden territory.
MP104430	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Ugh	 I just need two more copies	 that's all!
MP104450	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	*sigh*
MP104452	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Oh	 hello. So	 I made a little mistake
at school...
MP104453	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I understand rationally that it's no big
deal	 but still...
MP104454	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Hey	 Sumi-san	 what do you do when you're
feeling depressed?
MP104455	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I don't often feel down in the dumps	 but
when I do...
MP104456	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Guess I just block it out with booze...
MP104457	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	...Huh?
MP104458	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Yup	 drown myself in hooch till I've
forgotten whatever was bothering me.
MP104460	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Well	 drinking till morning's enough to wipe
your memory of just about anything.
MP104461	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I can't say I recommend it... But maybe
there's a lesson to learn in there somewhere?
MP104462	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Well	 for now I know there's no point
in worrying.
MP104463	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	I don't know if what you said was useful	
but I can see that my situation isn't so bad.
MP104464	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Haha	 harsh words! But as long as I could be
of help	 that's all that matters.
MP104465	S<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>iji Shiratori	Um	 that wasn't supposed to be praise. And
I'm definitely not following your example!
MP104500	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	{NAME2}! It's you.
MP104501	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Didn't expect to run into you here.
MP104502	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Or maybe it's not so unexpected...
Who knows? Hehe.
MP104520	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Another nice day.
MP104521	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Nothing going on	 nothing to do...
MP104522	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	My favorite kind of day. Know what I mean?
MP104540	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Well	 if it isn't {NAME2}.
You doing all right?
MP104541	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I'm... fine	 I guess.
MP104542	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	But being fine is pretty stellar in my book.
MP104560	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	No one's going to come looking for me	 which
means no problems or issues.
MP104561	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	It couldn't be more peaceful... But
something's missing.
MP104563	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I just miss the fishing pond.
MP104564	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I think throwing my line in the water there
is my favorite thing in the world.
MP104580	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I bet a lot of girls like you.
MP104582	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Knew it. I can always tell with stuff
like that.
MP104583	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Throughout my life	 I keep bumping into
people who do good deeds for me.
MP104584	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Like the random stranger who gave me a
snack a minute ago.
MP104585	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	It'd be mean to reject them	 so I
accepted it.
MP104586	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	The world really is full of good people.
MP104600	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	The other day I was at the fishing pond as
always	 and some guy came up to me.
MP104601	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	He told me his whole life story and then
burst into tears.
MP104602	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I was a little taken aback.
MP104604	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Said he was the CEO of some company	 I think?
He thanked me so much I felt bad.
MP104605	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	But that wasn't all.
MP104606	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Later he asked if I'd become a board member
at his company!
MP104607	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	It was hard to turn him down	 haha.
MP104609	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Do you have a favorite author	
{NAME2}?
MP104611	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	Oh	 really? I never buy a book because of
the author.
MP104612	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I choose what to read based on what the
book is about.
MP104613	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	There are some authors I read more often	
but that doesn't mean I like all their books.
MP104614	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I do end up reading every book by certain
authors	 though.
MP104615	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	To me	 choosing a book by its author is
like gambling.
MP104616	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	It means you're buying a book without caring
what it's about.
MP104618	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I see. Maybe that's what it means to be
a fan.
MP104619	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I learn so much from talking to you.
MP104620	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>shiya Sumi	I couldn't care in the least.
MP104621	AAAAAA==	Really? Not what I expected. You really got
me thinking	 though...
MP104623	AAAAAA==	I was just getting advice from Sumi-san. You
see	 I have trouble keeping my distance
with others.
MP104624	AAAAAA==	I tend to give people presents or treat them
to meals even when they're my senior.
MP104625	AAAAAA==	And I said I don't care about things
like that.
MP104626	AAAAAA==	If someone prepared something special
for me...
MP104627	AAAAAA==	It would be ruder to turn them away	 right?
MP104628	AAAAAA==	I see	 I see... You've been very helpful!
MP104630	AAAAAA==	What? You think so?
MP104631	AAAAAA==	But I feel like he made all my worries
go away...
MP104632	AAAAAA==	He's so friendly and open minded. You don't
find people like him easily.
MP104633	AAAAAA==	Whoa now	 you're going too far with the
praise. I'm nobody special.
MP104634	AAAAAA==	Anybody would be happy to receive a
thoughtful present from you	 Masaki.
MP104635	AAAAAA==	I meant what I said.
MP104636	AAAAAA==	Sumi-san...
MP104638	AAAAAA==	Haha	 sorry. I went a bit too far	 huh.
MP104639	AAAAAA==	I shouldn't go accepting expensive gifts from
high schoolers... I guess?
MP104700	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hmm... For my next job...
MP104701	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Maybe I'll try something a little different!
MP104702	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I wonder if any place interesting
is recruiting?
MP104720	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I really loved the beach house!
MP104721	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	A place where you can fully enjoy the
moment and soak in the summer air...
MP104722	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hehe! Makes me wanna go back!
MP104740	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Customers stare at you if you wear anything
unusual to work...
MP104741	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's kind of embarrassing	 but it's also fun!
I could get used to it...
MP104742	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Er	 not in like an exhibitionist way
or anything!
MP104743	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	It's not like that. Promise.
MP104760	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	*sigh*
MP104762	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 {NAME1}-kun...
MP104763	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I've been pigging out a little too much on
the staff meals at the beach house...
MP104764	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	So	 now I'm trying to think of good ways to
lose that weight again... Ahaha...
MP104780	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	{NAME1}-kun	 what flavor of syrup
do you like on your shaved ice?
MP104782	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 I like that one too! It's so good!
MP104783	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Plus	 you get your tongue dyed a fun color
when you're done	 haha!
MP104784	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 that reminds me!
MP104785	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Some people say those syrups are actually
all the same flavor	 just different colors.
MP104786	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Do you think that's true? I swear they
taste different!
MP104800	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	There's something appealing about a job
you'd only get to do at the right place
and time.
MP104801	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Stuff like beach houses that only pop up
for one season and then disappear again.
MP104802	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I'd really like to do something like that
again	 so I've been searching.
MP104803	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Which do you think would be better to work at	
a Shinto shrine or a traditional inn?
MP104805	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Hm	 yeah	 I thought you might say that...
MP104806	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Okay	 sure! I'll try that.
MP104820	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ugh... This is why you should never
forget sunscreen.
MP104822	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 {NAME2}-kun!
MP104823	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	I forgot to put on sunscreen before work
the other day...
MP104824	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Without it	 I burn as red as a
boiled lobster!
MP104825	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	At least playing baseball	 I'd be shielded
by my hat and uniform...
MP104826	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Ugh	 sorry. It's kind of embarrassing to be
seen like this...
MP104828	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	Oh	 r-really?
MP104829	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	That's a relief... Haha...
MP104830	Tomoko No<#000000	g	#FFFFFF>e	B-But	 I still need to be careful next time!
MP104900	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Hey	 Wonder.
Good job out there.
MP104901	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	This place is pretty cozy	 and at the same
time	 somewhat familiar...
MP104902	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Sorry. That was a weird thing to say. Just
forget it.
MP104920	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	......
MP104921	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Oh hey	 Wonder. Sorry	 I was just lost
in thought.
MP104922	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	I was just thinking about brewing coffee...
The blend	 the process and what dessert
I would pair it with...
MP104923	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Talking about it is making me crave a cup.
How about we go grab one later?
MP104940	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Are you looking for something?
MP104941	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Just looking around? In that case...
MP104942	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Mind if I tag along? That display piece looks
like the perfect spot for a Phantom Thief
to hide.
MP105000	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Yo	 Wonder! You showed up too	 huh?
MP105001	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This place is pretty strange	 but meeting
you in this form feels like a bit of a bonus!
MP105002	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Mewhehehee!
MP105020	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	This place... It feels different from
Mementos or any Palace. Kinda mysterious	
you know?
MP105021	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	I wonder if that display piece has anything
to do with it? Hmm...
MP105022	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Well	 I'm not sensing any threats here	 so I
guess we'll be fine.
MP105023	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	But just what does this thing symbolize?
Fill me in if you know.
MP105040	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Anyway	 now that we have some downtime	
how about I teach you how to be a real
phantom thief?
MP105041	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Listen up. A true phantom thief is a
gentleman of class‚Äîelegant	 stylish	 and...
MP105042	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	...as stunning as Lady Ann! Heh	 got it?
...What's with that skeptical look of yours?
MP105100	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Ahh... I can't decide...
MP105101	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Wonder! You came at the perfect time	 man!
MP105102	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I was thinkin' of ramen for dinner. Should I
go with shoyu or miso?
MP105120	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Yo	 Wonder! What's bonkin'!
MP105121	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hmm? What does that mean? It's kinda like...
MP105122	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Good morning, "how are ya	 and stay
fresh" all jumbled together.
MP105123	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	It's a personal greeting! So	 what's bonkin'?
MP105140	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	This place is super weird	 but it's really
big	 huh.
MP105141	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I wonder how long it would take to sprint
from wall to wall...
MP105142	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	All right! I'm gonna gun it! Wait	 am I gonna
get in trouble for running indoors?
MP105200	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Goooood morning	 Wonder!
MP105201	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Wait	 is it still morning? Should I be saying
good afternoon?
MP105202	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Well	 whatever! What matters is that I said
hello	 right?
MP105220	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	This place has	 like	 a glamorous vibe to it.
MP105221	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	But it's not as intense as a Palace	 so it's
actually kinda cozy here.
MP105222	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I'm in my Phantom Thief clothes	 but there
aren't any Shadows. It almost feels like
d√©j√† vu.
MP105223	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh	 I know! It's like a Safe Room!
MP105240	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Ugh... What to do...
MP105241	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Huh? Ah	 no! Don't worry! It's not like a
serious problem or anything.
MP105242	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I was just wondering what dessert I should go
try next... Wait	 why are you laughing?
MP105300	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	So	 you're here too	 Wonder.
MP105301	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	This place sees its fair share of unfamiliar
faces‚Äîample material for observation.
MP105302	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Seeing someone I know brings a certain
sense of relief. By the way... may I sketch
you?
MP105320	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Hm? That installation... Is it new?
MP105321	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Such tumultuous emotions... and yet	 there's
a faint light	 sinking deep within.
MP105322	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Fwahaha! Inspiration hits! My muse...
MP105323	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	There isn't a moment to lose! I need
my brush! Wait	 where is it? Oh no	
it's missing!
MP105340	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	This place is truly peculiar. Even though
time passes	 I don't feel myself getting
hungry...
MP105341	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	But rather	 a longing to eat... A certain
craving	 if you will.
MP105342	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Oh	 that's it! With these numbers	 how about
hot pot? And we can finish the soup by
adding rice afterward.
MP105900	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	I see	 I see. So strength isn't the key...
MP105901	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Yeah. It takes a while before you get the
hang of it.
MP105903	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	No	 we're actually talking about shaving
bonito flakes.
MP105904	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	I want to try making my own ramen. I heard
Soy is an authority on the subject.
MP105905	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Well	 I'm still just an apprentice...
MP105906	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Don't be so humble. You've taught me so
much already.
MP105907	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Glad to hear it	 but I need to improve
quickly so that I can teach others.
MP105908	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Actually	 if there was a kitchen here	 then
we could all practice and teach each other.
MP105909	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	That'd be nice. Maybe I could show you
how to make curry	 too.
MP105911	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Don't worry	 you'd be on taste-testing duty.
MP105912	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Hmm... But there are a lotta people here	
so you might have some competition for
the role.
MP105913	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Right. And just between us	 Panther
loses it when it comes to sweet stuff.
MP105914	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	No kiddin'! I have a pretty big sweet tooth
myself.
MP105915	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Baking desserts is just a hobby of mine	 but
I'd love to get Panther to try a bite.
MP105916	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	And Mona loves sushi	 by the way.
MP105918	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sushi is bit high-end	 but if I had a
kitchen	 I'd try. Can you arrange for one?
MP105950	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Grrrrr...
MP105951	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Grrrrr...
MP105953	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I refuse to allow such a trivial matter
escalate into an undignified debate!
MP105954	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All I wanted was to open your eyes to the
correct way of the world.
MP105955	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Oh wow	 so this is how you think it ought
to be	 huh? Your world must be a total mess!
MP105957	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Meat is a staple for every special occasion!
Imagine the succulent flavors you are missing!
MP105958	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	No way! It's all about fish! Has this
lemur-wannabe even tried sushi?
MP105959	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I have	 indeed! I suppose you are yet to know
the sumptuous taste of meat on the bone?
MP105960	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Been there	 done that! I had more than my
fill at Noir's house!
MP105961	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	And yet	 I'd choose fish any day! One vote
for sushi coming right up!
MP105962	M<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>na and L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Grrr...!
MP105964	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm. You raise a fair point.
MP105965	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	You're right. It was selfish of me to get so
carried away.
MP105967	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	What Wonder says goes	 I suppose. I'll give
you your temporary ceasefire.
MP105968	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 I suppose a hearty bowl of ramen
wouldn't hurt. That juicy pork... *shlurp*
MP106000	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Hey	 that looks super heavy...
MP106001	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	I don't think it is. Wanna give it a try?
Oh	 wait. Might be a bit risky to do here.
MP106003	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	I'm talking about the weapon that Soy uses
in the Metaverse. I mean	 a Gatling gun!?
MP106004	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	We were talkin' about weapon mastery and
the conversation kinda blew up.
MP106005	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	When I said it wasn't heavy	 I wasn't
referring to the weight...
MP106006	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	But do hippos really weigh that much?
They'd flatten you in an instant!
MP106007	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	As fun as it is to talk about hippos... I was
talking about the gun I use.
MP106008	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	It's big and looks pretty heavy... but in the
Metaverse	 it doesn't feel that way.
MP106009	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Does this also have to do with cognition and
what not? Wind might know more about this.
MP106010	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Who gives about the details? It's awesome
you can easily use somethin' so cool.
MP106011	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	But you use that badass shotgun	 too	 right?
That's impressive	 if you ask me.
MP106013	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	For real!? But... There aren't any Shadows
here. Maybe it's best to give it a rest
for now.
MP106014	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	If we ever end up fighting together in the
Metaverse	 it might be fun to try it out.
MP106015	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Oh yeah	 it's a deal! Weapon swapping and
stuff like that sounds unreal!
MP106050	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Have you ever randomly got a huge craving
to eat a certain food?
MP106051	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh yeah! Like you suddenly want to eat
something even without watching a food
video or anything!
MP106052	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Right!? In fact	 I've got something in mind
right now.
MP106053	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But here's a question for you! What is it
that I want to eat?
MP106054	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	It could be pretty much anything! Hmm. Give
me a hint at least! Is it sweet?
MP106055	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	It's sweet... Well	 to me at least!
MP106056	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Umm... Okay. It's a cr√™pe! One of those
banana custard ones!
MP106057	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sorry	 but no.
MP106058	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Here I was thinking it was one of the
obvious ones! Hey	 Wonder! Any ideas?
MP106060	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Wrong! But now that you mention it	 I
wouldn't mind one of those right now...
MP106061	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	The correct answer is...
miso-flavored peanuts!
MP106062	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	That's right! Its sweet and salty flavor is
irresistible! But... how did you know?
MP106063	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I wasn't thinking about them	 but thanks to
Closer	 I'm now craving them myself...
MP106064	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Oh man	 I might not be able to think about
anything else now!
MP106065	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Heh	 heh	 heh. One more casualty for the
cause! Ahhh	 I really want some!
MP106100	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Panther	 got a minute?
MP106101	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Sure. What is it?
MP106102	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I wanted to ask you about your weapon.
Isn't a whip kind of difficult to use?
MP106103	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Is there some sort of trick to it?
MP106104	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Hmm	 good question... To be honest	 at times	
I just enjoy lashing it about.
MP106105	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I mean	 it's not like I'm using a whip in my
everyday life	 right?
MP106106	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Not to imply that you're using rifles or
swords on a daily basis	 either.
MP106108	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	So true. Being in a phantom thief outfit
allows you to pull off moves you can't
usually do.
MP106109	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I	 for one	 have never once fought by
throwing an umbrella before.
MP106110	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Gifted with the whip? I'm not sure if I
should feel happy about that or not.
MP106111	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	I know! Why not try using a whip	 Wind? It
might work out in the Metaverse!
MP106112	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Wh-What!? Hm... Maybe I should take you
up on that?
MP106113	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	It'd be easy to use somewhere this open.
Aim	 strike... and yell out your catchphrase!
MP106114	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	L-Let me hear you squeal!
MP106150	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	A sketch? You mean one of those sessions
where I'm not allowed to move?
MP106151	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	No	 you can move all you want. Actually	 it's
your motion that I want to capture.
MP106152	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	But there's no kitchen here	 so all we can
do is have you mimic the movements.
MP106154	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	You want me to pretend I'm boiling ramen?
Kinda like air guitar but with a strainer?
MP106155	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Right. It might be more convincing if you
had tools	 but that'd be difficult to
do here...
MP106156	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Well	 will you do it for me?
MP106157	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Sure. I'm not cool with stayin' still	 but
I'm game as long as I can move.
MP106158	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Also	 I'm always drainin' water and shavin'
bonito flakes. I can do it in my sleep!
MP106160	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Okay! Let me know if something's not
working for you	 Fox!
MP106161	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	Why're you talkin' like I'm your apprentice?
Well	 whatever. You'll see!
MP106162	Shun K<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>no	First	 I'll start with the straining motion.
Ha	 ha	 ha! Haaah!
MP106163	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Ohhh! Just as I expected! Expertly honed
movements... This is exactly what I wanted.
MP106164	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Fwahaha! It's coming along! And rather
swimmingly at that! Wooo!
MP106200	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 hey! Do you happen to have anything
to write with?
MP106202	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Yes! I mean like a pen or a pencil	
anything really...
MP106203	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I see... That's a shame. I guess I'll just
have to memorize it somehow.
MP106205	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	But... But... This is my big chance!
MP106208	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Queen's lessons are so easy to understand!
Even I can remember everything...
MP106209	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Or	 so I thought... It turns out that
listening just isn't enough!
MP106212	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh	 I see. Okay	 then! Let me give it a try!
MP106215	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Thank you	 Queen!
MP106302	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Seriously. You and Closer both have
outrageous appetites...
MP106303	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I was just talking with Queen about
plum dishes.
MP106305	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yes. Our main product is umeboshi	 but we
also have a restaurant that specializes in
plum dishes.
MP106306	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Also	 although we can't drink yet	 there are
some stores that specialize in plum wine.
MP106308	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Of course. It helps relieve fatigue	 making
it popular with athletes.
MP106313	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Then I'll bring a selection of drinks next
time. That way	 everyone can taste and
compare them.
MP106314	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	The refreshing	 tangy flavor of the plum
makes it goes well with fluffy rice. Shall I
ask Soy to make it for us?
MP106400	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	If I had even some tech knowledge	 maybe I
could learn to manipulate computer systems
like you	 Oracle?
MP106401	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	For example... hacking open a locked door.
MP106405	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Apprentice!?
MP106406	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Very well. The desire to learn is important.
This is not something you can pick up
overnight.
MP106407	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Please	 Oracle. Teach me everything you
know about hacking!
MP106415	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Yeah	 I suppose. Sorry. I just thought I
could support the team like you do	 Oracle.
MP106416	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Thank you. I will try to support everyone in
my own way the best I can.
MP106500	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Whoa	 you have a home garden?
MP106503	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Big vegetables	 huh. Sounds great! I bet
they're really filling!
MP106504	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Oh! If I had some of those carrots and
tomatoes	 I could make a dish I really love!
MP106506	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	You guessed it! It's delicious and has
tons of tomatoes in it!
MP106508	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Rata... what?
MP106510	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	All this talk is making me want to grow
some greens of my own!
MP106512	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Sure thing! Though I'd prefer it if we could
eat them all here together.
MP106513	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	I know! How about growing a vegetable
patch here?
MP106515	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Okay	 that settles it! I'll go look for
planters	 seedlings	 and a kitchen!
MP106602	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	B-Beautiful	 huh... You're really making
me blush...
MP106604	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Not you	 too...
MP106605	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	I	 myself	 never thought I'd end up looking
anything like this.
MP106606	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What if your phantom thief outfit happened
to change like this	 Noir?
MP106607	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	What do you think the design would be?
MP106612	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Me? In Queen's outfit!? I wonder if I could
seriously do it justice?
MP106615	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	Hehe	 it might be fun to try on each others'
phantom thief costumes someday.
MP106701	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Violet is an honest person	 so I think she
saw what she says she saw.
MP106704	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Violet claims to have seen a figure with
two heads.
MP106709	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	She claims to have seen it over there. And
she mentioned it was slender.
MP106712	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	A temporary detective team? Sounds fun.
Care to join	 too	 Wonder?
MP106803	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	The challenge is to eat a burger bigger than
your face within the time limit.
MP106807	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Anyway	 Violet was talking about wanting
to try it.
MP106809	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Well	 I was certainly shocked the first time
I saw one of your lunches...
MP106811	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	Well...
MP106813	J<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ker	......
MP106901	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. I may resemble an owl of sorts.
What of it?
MP106906	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Yes. I myself am able to fly. Only my outward
appearance bears similarity to an owl.
MP106907	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Therefore	 I am capable of flight.
MP106908	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Don't lie so brazenly! I can fly!
I always could!
MP106909	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 I sometimes think it'd be nice if
I could fly in the Metaverse as well...
MP106910	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	For example	 acquiring an item that's up
high can be quite the challenge.
MP106913	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Correct. Nothing gets past a detective
like you	 I see...
MP106914	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It is quite embarrassing to tell the truth...
So	 would you mind putting me down?
MP107002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are indeed many to choose from...
But the first thing that comes to mind
is frankfurters.
MP107003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Regular frankfurters are good	 but the
grilled ones are the best. They're
hooting sublime!
MP107005	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Of course! There are some things you can
only understand by refining your palate.
MP107010	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What's the matter	 Violet? You seem to be
making a strange face.
MP107013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I must say	 there are certain things I
refrain from doing in plain sight.
MP107014	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	My reputation as a Phantom Thief would be
tarnished if word were to spread!
MP107016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	......
MP107101	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Why	 hello there	 sugar. Welcome!

MP107154	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Sure was. I was certain that you were gonna
stop by. Call it a hunch!
MP107155	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Now	 ain't this just a sight to behold? It's
so wonderfully strange... right?
MP107156	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	If you ask me	 this place is a lot like them
Palaces you've been to‚Äîit's got that
same energy.
MP107157	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	That's not all! I actually feel the same aura
from... well	 you	 sugar pie!
MP107158	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Looks to me like this is your very own
Palace! How 'bout namin' it "Thieves' Den"?
Sounds fittin' for you and your friends!
MP107161	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Well	 darlin'	 I whipped up a bunch of real
nice surprises just for ya.
MP107162	Protagonist	Great	 a sales tactic...|This feels sketchy...
MP107163	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Now that's just plain cold	 doncha think?
MP107164	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I've been bustin' my chops to give y'all the
best customer experience I could... I guess
this ain't what y'all were lookin' for...
MP107165	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I guess it's time to roll up my sleeves‚ÄîI
promise to work my darndest to clear up all
your doubts!
MP107166	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	That's right	 if anythin' catches your

everythin' ya need to know about it!
MP107200	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah yes	 you have an eye for value	 doncha!
MP107201	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	This here is the Den Maker	 and it's
chock-full of all sorts of weird and
wonderful finds!
MP107202	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	As I'm sure you'll agree	 this place could
do with a splash of personality. Doncha
think it's a little... barren?
MP107203	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	But that's where this here Den Maker comes to
the rescue! I'm positively sure it's all you
need to make your Den a home.
MP107204	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	From costumes to furnishings... Anything
you desire can be purchased here!
MP107206	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Oh	 no! You don't need cash. Instead	 it
takes these P Medals!
MP107207	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Simply insert your P Medals into the slot	
and I promise somethin' real nice'll
come out!
MP107208	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Since this entire place is yours for the
decoratin'	 you can arrange your displays
any way you want!
MP107209	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	That sums everythin' ya need to know about
it. Now all that's left is to try it
for yourself!
MP107250	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	So first I do this...
Then I press this button...
And last but not least...
MP107251	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Yes	 looks like I've still got it! Ah... 
nothin' beats a sweet servin' of Marthym's
stellar customer service!
MP107252	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah	 good timing. I was just thinkin' we could do
with some music.
MP107254	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Well	 this is the first time I'm seein' one
of these	 so... bear with me while I figure
out how to explain it!
MP107255	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Let's see now... simply touch the screen
then select the name of a song...
MP107256	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	And it'll start playing some tunes! Now
ain't that somethin'?
MP107257	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Your turn! Go ahead and give it a whirl.
MP107300	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Hm... What have we here? I've never seen
such a contraption before.
MP107301	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Perhaps you know what it is?
MP107303	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Movies	 huh? Oh	 I've heard of those! Them
machines with big spools of film that go
round and round...
MP107304	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Hm? It seems to be missin' a place to put
the film in.
MP107305	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Seems to be a load of buttons on this thing.
I'll just go ahead and press 'em!
MP107306	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Well shoot... I s'pose this is probably more
your area of expertise so... I'm gonna leave
operatin' this thing to you!
MP107350	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah... ain't that a massive showstopper! This
has got to be the most gorgeous picture frame
I've ever laid eyes on!
MP107351	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	What do you think of it?
MP107353	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	You said it... 
I don't know why it's all by itself.
MP107354	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I've tried everythin' I could to get a few
more	 but... I've not had any luck.
MP107355	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Y'know what	 sugar? I'm gonna need your help
to turn this into a gorgeous gallery burstin'
with beautiful snippets from your life!
MP107356	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Your job is to go out there and make
loads of good memories for this collection!
MP107357	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I'm looking forward to seeing what

MP107400	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	C'mere	 sweet pea! I got somethin' to
show ya!
MP107401	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Does this look familiar?
MP107403	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Yup! Your very own dedicated Tycoon
playing area!
MP107404	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Just like in your Companio	 you can play
cards to your heart's content here.
MP107405	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Who knows? Maybe switchin' up the scenery
could give your games a whole new vibe!
MP107406	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Why not play a match right now	 sugar?
MP107450	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Over here looks like the way up to the
second floor!
MP107451	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I've got a hunch that somethin' mighty
incredible is up there...
MP107453	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Well	 I sure would love to take ya up there	
but I just can't!
MP107454	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	There seems to be some sort of invisible wall
keepin' me out...
MP107455	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Butter my biscuit	 looks like you're able to
get through! I just knew you had a special
connection with this place!
MP107456	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Whatever it is up there	 you're gonna get to
see it with your very own eyes!
MP107500	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Aaand it looks like we've covered everythin'.
If ya need somethin' else	 I'm just a
shout away!
MP107501	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah	 there is actually one last thing...
The shelves!
MP107502	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	As you make this place grow	 I'll give you
gifts to help ya fill out them shelves!
MP107503	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Consider it my way of sayin' thanks for
gussying up the place.
MP107504	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Through your continued support	 I'm certain
this place'll bloom into somethin' wonderful.
MP107505	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah... Oh	 yes	 I almost forgot.
MP107506	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	While I was inspectin' this area earlier	
a guest suddenly turned up outta nowhere.
MP107507	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	They looked like one of them friends of yours
that you go out adventurin' with.
MP107508	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Thing is	 when I offered them a friendly 
hello	 they suddenly disappeared!
MP107509	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Maybe you'd be able to talk to 'em?
MP107511	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Sorry	 pumpkin	 but I ain't seen 'em today...
MP107512	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	You should make sure to say hi to them next
time you see 'em!
MP107513	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I betcha somethin' good'll come out of it!

MP100621	AAAAAA==	Hello there!
MP100622	AAAAAA==	...Sorry	 but could you please return

Fire away!
MP100704	AAAAAA==	Nothing comes to mind...|I'll pass.
MP100705	AAAAAA==	B-But why!? This is your big chance to to
ask me anything you could ever think of!
MP100706	AAAAAA==	Ah	 I suppose I did catch you off guard.
Make sure to be ready with a question

MP100711	AAAAAA==	Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
MP100712	AAAAAA==	And now for the moment you've all been
waiting for: question time! Just ask
me anything!
MP100713	AAAAAA==	Go on	 ask away!
MP100714	AAAAAA==	What's your favorite subject?|Got a part-time job?
MP100715	AAAAAA==	Oh my! Do I look like a high schooler to you?
MP100716	AAAAAA==	Ah... Hm.
MP100717	AAAAAA==	No comment. Moving on!
MP100721	AAAAAA==	Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
MP100722	AAAAAA==	And now for the moment you've all been
waiting for: question time! Just ask
me anything!
MP100723	AAAAAA==	Anything... except questions that make me
sound like a high schooler!
MP100724	AAAAAA==	What's your favorite food?|Thing to bring to a desert island?
MP100725	AAAAAA==	Why	 potatoes	 of course!
MP100726	AAAAAA==	You can roast them	 mash them	 and even throw
them in a stew! Growing them is fun	 too!
MP100727	AAAAAA==	A life without spuds is truly terrible
to imagine!
MP100728	AAAAAA==	Don't you agree?
MP100729	AAAAAA==	I accidentally let Yui drag
me into her antics...
MP100741	AAAAAA==	Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
MP100742	AAAAAA==	Now	 it's time for ME to ask YOU questions!
MP100743	AAAAAA==	My question is... What is your favorite
vegetable?
MP100744	AAAAAA==	I'm a potato lover.|Do potatoes count?
MP100745	AAAAAA==	Of course	 of course	 just the reply
I expected!
MP100746	AAAAAA==	I'm a fan of potatoes myself! In fact	 it's
my favorite food altogether!
MP100747	AAAAAA==	We really are two potatoes in a pod!<sprite=1 tint=1>
MP100748	AAAAAA==	Now it's time for the goodbye greeting.
Say it with me!
MP100749	AAAAAA==	Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
MP100750	AAAAAA==	Pa	 payappa...?|Payappa!
MP100751	AAAAAA==	Well done!<sprite=1 tint=1>
MP100752	AAAAAA==	I joined Yui as she waved
to thin air...
MP100801	AAAAAA==	What's wrong?|You look scared...
MP100802	AAAAAA==	Oh my! Sounds like someone's in a pickle.
MP100803	AAAAAA==	What on god's green earth happened!?
MP100805	AAAAAA==	Oh! Are you trying to say that you're
lacking energy?
MP100806	AAAAAA==	In that case... I recommend a good helping
of vegetables!
MP100807	AAAAAA==	Heh... Helping people help themselves...
to helpings of vegetables!
MP100808	AAAAAA==	He he he	 dang I'm good	 or should I say	
I'm unbeetable!
MP100809	AAAAAA==	Take it down a notch.|You're going way too hard.
MP100810	AAAAAA==	Well	 if you say so	 then... Hmmm?
MP100811	AAAAAA==	You	 the one shaking like a rabbit. Is that
Shichi-kun you've got there?
MP100813	AAAAAA==	Yes	 I know Shichi-kun. I keep one at the
office‚Äîahem. Allow me to rephrase.
MP100814	AAAAAA==	What I meant was	 a friend of mine who works
in Shibuya keeps a Shichi-kun on her desk.
MP100817	AAAAAA==	Of course.|She sure is.
MP100819	AAAAAA==	Yui	 Runa	 and I had a lengthy
discussion about Shichi-kun...
MP100961	AAAAAA==	Tongue twisters?|You're pretty good.
MP100965	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I practiced
tongue twisters together...
MP100984	AAAAAA==	Keyboard.|A wind instrument.|Percussion.
MP100986	AAAAAA==	We talked for a while longer
about musical instruments...
MP101001	AAAAAA==	I have.|Never.
MP101007	AAAAAA==	I talked with Ayaka about
foreign countries we'd like
to visit someday...
MP101021	AAAAAA==	Someone's in a good mood.|What're you singing?
MP101025	AAAAAA==	It was a nice tune.|I'd like to hear the rest.
MP101030	AAAAAA==	Ayaka and I fleshed out
her new song together...
MP101055	AAAAAA==	Yup.|Kinda.
MP101059	AAAAAA==	You recognize Ayaka?|Ayaka's famous now?
MP101067	AAAAAA==	Ayaka	 Kotone	 and I laughed
about what a small world
we live in...
MP101163	AAAAAA==	It's good to have hobbies.|Passion makes perfect	 right?
MP101165	AAAAAA==	Kira and I talked more
about shooting games...
MP101183	AAAAAA==	Really? Just for the coat?|That's so you.
MP101186	AAAAAA==	Kira and I further discussed
the benefits of lab coats...
MP101204	AAAAAA==	You have a friend now.|You started hanging with me.
MP101209	AAAAAA==	Kira and I discussed the
meaning of friendship...
MP101252	AAAAAA==	More does not equal merrier.|Depends on the relationship.
MP101256	AAAAAA==	You consider me a friend?|What's gotten into you?
MP101260	AAAAAA==	I listened as Kira openly
talked about being friends...
MP101361	AAAAAA==	What's the matter?|Shall I lend a hand?
MP101365	AAAAAA==	In the end	 Runa wasn't
able to decide...
MP101383	AAAAAA==	I'd like to see.|Can I come over?
MP101386	AAAAAA==	Runa steadfastly refused my
request for a home visit...
MP101403	AAAAAA==	It's all in your head.|You're overthinking it.
MP101406	AAAAAA==	Runa remained convinced of
how much danger Shichi-kun
was in...
MP101421	AAAAAA==	Of course.|Hit me.
MP101426	AAAAAA==	Maybe next time.|That'd take two full nights.
MP101430	AAAAAA==	Runa kept begging until
I told her everything I love
about Shibuya...
MP101563	AAAAAA==	Sorry	 what?|I might need a translator...
MP101566	AAAAAA==	I'm not entirely sure what
she's saying	 but that's
Tomiyama for you...
MP101584	AAAAAA==	That's great.|Oh	 you just wanted to brag?
MP101586	AAAAAA==	Tomiyama kept gushing over
her husband for what felt
like forever...
MP101602	AAAAAA==	Things happen in life.|Hey	 stop prying.
MP101605	AAAAAA==	Tomiyama seems as
laid-back as ever...
MP101621	AAAAAA==	No comment.|Take a guess.
MP101627	AAAAAA==	Really?|I don't get it.
MP101630	AAAAAA==	Tomiyama ended up asking
me even more prying questions
about my love life...
MP101762	AAAAAA==	That's rough.|Sounds like a workout.
MP101765	AAAAAA==	Minami and I talked about
the struggles of looking
after kids...
MP101784	AAAAAA==	Was it that good?|I guess they liked it.
MP101786	AAAAAA==	Minami and I chatted about
the joys of watching
over kids...
MP101804	AAAAAA==	I know the feeling.|You prefer happy endings?
MP101808	AAAAAA==	I recommended some
comedies to Minami...
MP101822	AAAAAA==	Salisbury Steak?|Omelette rice?
MP101826	AAAAAA==	You could make both.|Let the kids choose.
MP101831	AAAAAA==	I told Minami about
my favorite dishes...
MP101961	AAAAAA==	I do.|Not so much.
MP101964	AAAAAA==	Kurotani and I had a lengthy
discussion about reading...
MP101981	AAAAAA==	I do.|Not so much.
MP101985	AAAAAA==	Kurotani and I chatted
about light novels...
MP102001	AAAAAA==	I'm more of a paperback person.|I prefer e-books.
MP102008	AAAAAA==	Kurotani and I discussed
the pros and cons of printed
and digital books...
MP102021	AAAAAA==	Sometimes.|Not really.
MP102030	AAAAAA==	I get it...|Take a chill pill.
MP102034	AAAAAA==	Kurotani recommended a number
of parallel world stories...
MP102163	AAAAAA==	Probably country of origin?|Just gotta memorize 'em.
MP102166	AAAAAA==	Yaoling asked me questions
about Japanese that she's
been wondering about...
MP102183	AAAAAA==	Miso soup.|I grate it into a condiment.
MP102187	AAAAAA==	Yaoling and I continued talking
about daikon dishes...
MP102202	AAAAAA==	What about croquette burgers?|How about okonomiyaki meals?
MP102207	AAAAAA==	Yaoling and I came up with
some examples of typical
foods in Japan...
MP102223	AAAAAA==	White and black are a thing?|I don't know the difference.
MP102230	AAAAAA==	Yaoling and I made plans for
our next tea party...
MP102258	AAAAAA==	You don't look like one to me.|Stubborn yet stunning.
MP102262	AAAAAA==	You're cute today	 Yaoling.|That looks really good on you.
MP102269	AAAAAA==	Yaoling	 Chizuko and I talked
about maturing with age...
MP102278	AAAAAA==	We're not old enough to drink.|Yaoling is underage	 too.
MP102289	AAAAAA==	Sounds like a great idea.|I'd love to try it.
MP102294	AAAAAA==	Yaoling	 Yumi	 and I talked
about Chinese tea-based
mocktails...
MP102362	AAAAAA==	Joy?|Betrayal?
MP102384	AAAAAA==	That seems just right.|What a lovely contrast.
MP102405	AAAAAA==	Once I'm done with everything.|Could you wait a bit?
MP102423	AAAAAA==	I don't really have time...|Seems like a lot to remember.
MP102445	AAAAAA==	What're you talking about?|You seem to be having fun.
MP102461	AAAAAA==	I ended up agreeing to play
a card game with them...
MP102561	AAAAAA==	What's going on?|Something bothering you?
MP102565	AAAAAA==	Kotone and I discussed what to
do with all those cakes...
MP102581	AAAAAA==	Ooh	 I want one!|Could I see it?
MP102587	AAAAAA==	The two of us designed a
new autograph together...
MP102602	AAAAAA==	Is that so?|Like what?
MP102609	AAAAAA==	Kotone kept the figure skating
facts coming...
MP102621	AAAAAA==	Is something wrong?|Tired?
MP102629	AAAAAA==	We'll find a low-calorie cake.|We should share one.
MP102631	AAAAAA==	Kotone and I discussed what
kind of cake would be best to
get with coffee...
MP102762	AAAAAA==	Why not check with your phone?|Isn't there an app for that?
MP102765	AAAAAA==	Kotone seems to have managed
to find the song name in
the end...
MP102782	AAAAAA==	What makes you say that?|That's not true at all.
MP102787	AAAAAA==	Kotone and I talked at length
about the intricacies of
taking passport pictures.
MP102803	AAAAAA==	I'd like to try those.|There are others too.
MP102809	AAAAAA==	Kotone and I had a spirited
conversation about our
favorite drinks...
MP102822	AAAAAA==	I agree.|You think so...?
MP102828	AAAAAA==	Why not press them?|Take up flower arrangement?
MP102831	AAAAAA==	Kotone and I continued to talk
about what she could do with
the flowers she receives...
MP102866	AAAAAA==	I agree.|I can't wait for the next one.
MP102872	AAAAAA==	Is it run by someone you know?|How do you know them?
MP102877	AAAAAA==	Our conversation about
Kichijoji's legendary designer
continued well after that...
MP102962	AAAAAA==	Teamwork makes the dream work.|I like lone heroes.
MP102968	AAAAAA==	Kamiyama and I talked about
live-action heroes for
a while...
MP102986	AAAAAA==	There's a lot to this.|I never imagined.
MP102990	AAAAAA==	Kamiyama shared his vast
behind-the-scenes knowledge
of live-action hero shows...
MP103011	AAAAAA==	Of course.|The big costumed mascot?
MP103018	AAAAAA==	Kamiyama told me his theories
about the person playing
Shichi-kun...
MP103031	AAAAAA==	You think so?|What do you mean?
MP103038	AAAAAA==	I think that's normal?|You look like you to me.
MP103042	AAAAAA==	Kamiyama and I reaffirmed
our friendship...
MP103064	AAAAAA==	What is this about?|You two are friends now?
MP103072	AAAAAA==	I still don't get it.|You two have fun.
MP103078	AAAAAA==	Kamiyama	 Kurotani	 and I
pledged ourselves as
kindred spirits...
MP103164	AAAAAA==	Not exactly...|I'd get a little scared.
MP103167	AAAAAA==	Yukimi and I ended up talking
for a while about how to be
more considerate...
MP103184	AAAAAA==	Duck tape.|All intensive purposes.
MP103187	AAAAAA==	Yukimi and I shared our
feelings about misused words
that are hard to point out...
MP103203	AAAAAA==	That's deep...|Talk about confusing.
MP103207	AAAAAA==	I got a sense of what Yukimi
is thinking by talking to her
about legal terminology...
MP103225	AAAAAA==	This is getting complicated.|You're saying you've grown?
MP103230	AAAAAA==	Yukimi seemed unaware that
she was being quite bold. I
gave her a vague response...
MP103257	AAAAAA==	You weren't listening.|I wouldn't call that relaxed.
MP103268	AAAAAA==	What's that supposed to mean?|Then what is she like?
MP103271	AAAAAA==	I introduced Yukimi to
Chizuko. They seem to get
along better than I thought...
MP103361	AAAAAA==	You mean the statue?|The one by the station?
MP103366	AAAAAA==	Haruna proceeded to tell me
more tales of Buchiko...
MP103381	AAAAAA==	There's a soccer club.|We have a band club.
MP103386	AAAAAA==	Haruna and I discussed what
the Explorer Club would do...
MP103401	AAAAAA==	That mascot thing?|I think I've seen it.
MP103407	AAAAAA==	Haruna took me on a deep dive
into Shichi-kun lore...
MP103411	AAAAAA==	It's in Shimokita.|I take the train there.
MP103415	AAAAAA==	I'll visit you in America.|I'll aim for the same college.
MP103419	AAAAAA==	Haruna and I discussed what
going to school in the States
would be like...
MP103423	AAAAAA==	I think she likes you.|You're already best friends.
MP103435	AAAAAA==	As their mutual friend	
I brought the two together...
MP103562	AAAAAA==	A classic sweet one.|Something filling and savory.
MP103565	AAAAAA==	Tomoko and I carried on
talking about different
cr√™pe fillings...
MP103584	AAAAAA==	Just share your passion.|As long as you're polite...
MP103587	AAAAAA==	Tomoko and I had fun
talking about our favorite
sports teams...
MP103603	AAAAAA==	Usually	 yeah.|I don't.
MP103607	AAAAAA==	Tomoko and I continued
discussing strange drinks...
MP103624	AAAAAA==	Glasses are better.|Contacts	 of course.
MP103628	AAAAAA==	A new style could work.|You look great the way you are.
MP103631	AAAAAA==	Tomoko was lost in thought
for a while after that...
MP103652	AAAAAA==	What're you doing?|Let's gooo!
MP103655	AAAAAA==	Hyped?|But why?
MP103668	AAAAAA==	We continued to hype
ourselves up until Tomoko and
Miyu ran out of steam...
MP103764	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 look at me as a person.|Gotta respect diversity.
MP103767	AAAAAA==	Chizuko gave me an earful
of her various
witty complaints...
MP103784	AAAAAA==	Is that really true?|Then why do you drink?
MP103787	AAAAAA==	I'm not sure if Chizuko is
saying something really
profound	 or if she's just hammered...
MP103805	AAAAAA==	You just sit back and watch?|How do you know what's right?
MP103808	AAAAAA==	I listened as Chizuko spilled
her thoughts on how she's
lived her life...
MP103825	AAAAAA==	Then lead by example.|Show them what it's like.
MP103830	AAAAAA==	Feeling sober	 Chizuko began
drawing up plans for
the world...
MP103962	AAAAAA==	But I'm a total beginner...|I don't feel ready.
MP103966	AAAAAA==	Shiina regaled me with
more stories about her
flair bartending...
MP103983	AAAAAA==	Maybe you should wear it.|I'd love to see you in one.
MP103987	AAAAAA==	It took a while to clear up
Shiina's misunderstanding...
MP104003	AAAAAA==	Worried about a rival?|Can't lose to her.
MP104009	AAAAAA==	Afterward	 Shiina and I had
a deep discussion about living
on a budget.
MP104021	AAAAAA==	I think they can really chug.|They're probably weaklings.
MP104026	AAAAAA==	Can't wait to see you drunk.|Bet you're quite the handful.
MP104030	AAAAAA==	Shiina lectured me on
how to handle a drunk...
MP104161	AAAAAA==	What're you watching?|Research?
MP104165	AAAAAA==	Miyu and I looked up ways
to utilize hard-to-use
spaces together...
MP104183	AAAAAA==	Are you okay?|Take your time.
MP104186	AAAAAA==	Miyu and I talked about what
we'd like to eat for dinner...
MP104203	AAAAAA==	I'll look into it.|Do we need them?
MP104206	AAAAAA==	Miyu and talked about
various much-needed
relaxation equipment...
MP104223	AAAAAA==	A fashion show?|Sketch comedy?
MP104228	AAAAAA==	I'm happy you're happy.|Can't wait for the show!
MP104230	AAAAAA==	Miyu and I brainstormed
plans for her new performance.
MP104361	AAAAAA==	What happened?|You seem stressed.
MP104365	AAAAAA==	Seiji and I pondered together
until he reached a decision...
MP104382	AAAAAA==	No	 not at all.|Just do you.
MP104403	AAAAAA==	So it's the same book?|What changed?
MP104409	AAAAAA==	I listened to Seiji go on
and on about his love
for that book...
MP104423	AAAAAA==	Must be rough.|Gonna buy another five?
MP104431	AAAAAA==	I somehow managed to
calm Seiji down...
MP104451	AAAAAA==	What's wrong?|You look sad.
MP104459	AAAAAA==	Fast way to lose your memory.|Drink till you drown?
MP104466	AAAAAA==	I guess Shiratori's problem
is solved then...?
MP104562	AAAAAA==	Need excitement?|It's too boring?
MP104581	AAAAAA==	Can't deny that.|Guys do	 too.
MP104603	AAAAAA==	You're a good listener.|Must've been awkward.
MP104610	AAAAAA==	Not really.|I have a few.
MP104617	AAAAAA==	It's a way to show support.|Maybe they're all good.
MP104622	AAAAAA==	What's going on?|Couldn't care about what?
MP104629	AAAAAA==	Sumi-san is quite... unique.|You shouldn't listen to him.
MP104637	AAAAAA==	You should know when to stop.|Stop teasing the poor kid.
MP104640	AAAAAA==	I gave Ashiya a stern warning
that Sumi is not exactly your
average guy...
MP104761	AAAAAA==	What's going on?|Something bothering you?
MP104765	AAAAAA==	Tomoko and I discussed good
diet and exercise plans...
MP104781	AAAAAA==	Melon.|Blue Hawaii.
MP104787	AAAAAA==	Tomoko and I had an
intense conversation
about syrup flavors...
MP104804	AAAAAA==	A traditional inn.|A shrine.
MP104807	AAAAAA==	We continued talking
enthusiastically about
unique part-time jobs...
MP104821	AAAAAA==	What's wrong?|You got sunburned?
MP104827	AAAAAA==	It really doesn't bother me.|I think it's cute.
MP104831	AAAAAA==	Tomoko continued explaining
the various ways to avoid
skin damage from UV rays...
MP105400	AAAAAA==	Oh	 Wonder. Nice to see you.
MP105401	AAAAAA==	Oracle was with me just a moment ago	 but
she left to go check on something.
MP105402	AAAAAA==	If you have a message	 I can relay it to her
when she comes back.
MP105420	AAAAAA==	No matter how many times I come here	
this place always feels so strange...
MP105421	AAAAAA==	It's not like a cognitive Metaverse	 but it
does feel like a collection of minds...
MP105422	AAAAAA==	No	 overthinking this is pointless. Besides	 I
doubt I'd find an answer anyway.
MP105423	AAAAAA==	At the end of the day	 all that matters is
it's a place where we can relax.
MP105440	AAAAAA==	Hey	 I saw an adorable stuffed animal over
there... Or maybe it was a full-body mascot?
MP105441	AAAAAA==	Is that a character from your world? I'd love
to know more if you don't mind sharing.
MP105442	AAAAAA==	It kind of reminds me of Buchimaru-kun
in a way!
MP105500	AAAAAA==	Oh! Good to see ya	 Wonder.
MP105501	AAAAAA==	I've just been looking around since there's
so much to see. It's like a little virtual
world in here.
MP105502	AAAAAA==	Whoa	 I've never seen that before! ...Wait	
no	 that's just Inari being Inari...
MP105520	AAAAAA==	This space is seriously huge. Oh! Does this
mean I can fill it with all my favorite stuff?
MP105521	AAAAAA==	First up is the Neo-Featherman figure. Then
my souped-up PC and instant yakisoba...
MP105522	AAAAAA==	And I can't forget my mini fridge either!
Not to mention a stash of snacks!
MP105523	AAAAAA==	Wait a minute... Am I just recreating
my room?
MP105540	AAAAAA==	Come to think of it	 when I passed by
there earlier...
MP105541	AAAAAA==	Mona and that hooded ghost were having a
spat	 but it was the cutest little argument.
MP105542	AAAAAA==	Those two actually get along... but they get
strangely mad if you point it out.
MP105600	AAAAAA==	Hello there	 Wonder!
MP105601	AAAAAA==	I was just admiring that display piece over
there. Its unique shape caught my attention.
MP105602	AAAAAA==	If it's okay with you	 I'd love to hear what
kind of art you like	 too.
MP105620	AAAAAA==	I know I should stop Mona-chan and Cattle
from bickering	 but...
MP105621	AAAAAA==	I don't know... I find myself not wanting to
interfere because they're just too adorable.
MP105622	AAAAAA==	I can't get enough. I just want to see more
of it.
MP105623	AAAAAA==	Do you ever have the same thought?
MP105640	AAAAAA==	When I see Queen in battle	 I can't help
but sometimes think...
MP105641	AAAAAA==	Driving around on Johanna looks like so
much fun. I'd love to try it someday.
MP105642	AAAAAA==	Oh	 right. Maybe I should ask Mona to let
me drive next time?
MP105700	AAAAAA==	Oh	 hey there.
MP105701	AAAAAA==	This is a curious space. It resembles a
Palace	 but is nowhere near as sinister...
MP105702	AAAAAA==	It has this soft	 inviting atmosphere that
makes you want to visit again and again.
MP105720	AAAAAA==	Earlier	 I was watching Violet's movements
together with Joker...
MP105721	AAAAAA==	Moving that effortlessly might come in
handy when fighting in the Metaverse.
MP105722	AAAAAA==	Perhaps I should ask her to teach me a
thing or two.
MP105723	AAAAAA==	Care to join me?
MP105740	AAAAAA==	......
MP105741	AAAAAA==	Oh	 sorry. Did you say something? I was
deep in thought.
MP105742	AAAAAA==	If you're planning to check on everyone	 do
you mind if I tag along?
MP105800	AAAAAA==	Hello there	 Wonder-senpai!
MP105801	AAAAAA==	I just got here myself. I umm...
MP105802	AAAAAA==	I'm still not very familiar with this place.
Would you like to look around together?
MP105820	AAAAAA==	Right... Point my fingertips more... I need
to convey bold conviction.
MP105821	AAAAAA==	Oh	 Wonder-senpai! I was just reviewing my
rhythmic gymnastics routine.
MP105822	AAAAAA==	Since I excel at bold	 expressive maneuvers	
I just wanted to find a way to make my moves
look more dynamic.
MP105823	AAAAAA==	I know! If it's okay with you	 could I ask
for your honest opinion?
MP105840	AAAAAA==	Just now	 I heard the sound of a wind
instrument from somewhere.
MP105841	AAAAAA==	Was that... a saxophone? Maybe? It sounded
so smooth yet confident...
MP105842	AAAAAA==	It was a lovely sound. I'd love to hear
again. After all	 music is what puts the
rhythm in rhythmic gymnastics!
MP105902	AAAAAA==	Learning a new weapon?|You talking about working out?
MP105910	AAAAAA==	Not a bad idea.|Yum...
MP105917	AAAAAA==	Sushi? Yes please.|I can't wait.
MP105952	AAAAAA==	What's wrong?|Stop fighting.
MP105956	AAAAAA==	I asked what was going on	
although I already knew it
was something petty...
MP105963	AAAAAA==	We all like different things.|Taste is subjective.
MP105966	AAAAAA==	Now	 go get ramen together.|Soy can cook up something.
MP106002	AAAAAA==	What're you talking about?|A hippo's about three tons...
MP106012	AAAAAA==	Why not change it up?|How about a trade?
MP106059	AAAAAA==	Red bean bun.|Miso-flavored peanuts.
MP106107	AAAAAA==	Because it's the Metaverse?|Maybe you're gifted?
MP106153	AAAAAA==	Lemme guess...|You mean...
MP106159	AAAAAA==	Give it your all!|I'll be watching.
MP106165	AAAAAA==	I watched Soy make
air ramen with Fox...
MP106201	AAAAAA==	You wanna note something down?|Like pen and paper?
MP106204	AAAAAA==	Hmm... That can be useful	 but memorization
alone can make it difficult to put what you
learn to practical use.
MP106206	AAAAAA==	What's this about?|Memorizing what?
MP106207	AAAAAA==	She asked if I could help her with some
math problems	 so I've been teaching her
formulas and solutions.
MP106210	AAAAAA==	If you can't write it down... You could try
to remember it using mnemonics or examples.
MP106211	AAAAAA==	If you try to memorize only the formulas	
you'll only end up confusing yourself.
MP106213	AAAAAA==	Let me join you.|Need help handling Closer?
MP106214	AAAAAA==	Hehe	 the more the merrier. Okay	 continuing
on from earlier...
MP106216	AAAAAA==	Queen taught Closer and I
how to memorize
math formulas...
MP106217	AAAAAA==	I wonder if I'll still
remember them when I
return to the real world?
MP106300	AAAAAA==	Huh... So	 you can enjoy it that way	 too.
MP106301	AAAAAA==	Is this about food?|You seem hungry...
MP106304	AAAAAA==	We tend to think of them being pickled to
make umeboshi	 but there are actually a
variety of ways to serve them.
MP106307	AAAAAA==	True. They're just as good in drink form.
Don't you sell plum juice or anything
like that?
MP106309	AAAAAA==	Relieving fatigue	 huh... Then they might
come in handy for our phantom thief
lifestyle.
MP106310	AAAAAA==	I'm quite curious about that plum rice you
told me about earlier.
MP106311	AAAAAA==	Which would you want to try	 Wonder?
MP106312	AAAAAA==	Plum juice.|Plum rice.
MP106315	AAAAAA==	That said	 all this talk about plums has left
me with a sour taste in my mouth...
MP106402	AAAAAA==	Heh heh heh! If that's what you want...
MP106403	AAAAAA==	Oh?|What are you planning?
MP106404	AAAAAA==	You can apprentice under me!
MP106408	AAAAAA==	I was joking	 actually... But if you're going
to put it that way	 how can I refuse?
MP106409	AAAAAA==	It'd probably be quicker to learn by doing.
Wonder	 do you happen to know of any
servers we can destroy?
MP106410	AAAAAA==	As if there is.|Don't ask me...
MP106411	AAAAAA==	Tch.
MP106412	AAAAAA==	Well	 let's be serious here. I don't want to
teach you	 the black-haired beauty.
MP106413	AAAAAA==	Hacking may be useful in the Metaverse	
but it's a crime in reality.
MP106414	AAAAAA==	And besides	 you have your own strengths.
You're fine just the way you are!
MP106417	AAAAAA==	Yeah	 that's the spirit! That's what I expect
from my apprentice! Heh!
MP106501	AAAAAA==	Not really	 because it's on the school's
rooftop. I've got carrots	 tomatoes	
and more.
MP106502	AAAAAA==	It's a lot of work to take care of them	 but
I love harvesting big vegetables.
MP106505	AAAAAA==	Minestrone?|Ratatouille?
MP106507	AAAAAA==	I also recommend adding lots of cabbage.
Making it from freshly-picked ingredients
sounds super fun!
MP106509	AAAAAA==	Ratatouille certainly contains a lot of
vegetables... But isn't it mainly bell
peppers and onions?
MP106511	AAAAAA==	Hehe. All right Closer	 my fellow gardener.
Let me know if you grow anything delicious.
MP106514	AAAAAA==	Oh! If we did that	 everyone could gather
here to cook together. Sounds like a lot
of fun!
MP106600	AAAAAA==	Wow... So phantom thief outfits outfit can
change like that.
MP106601	AAAAAA==	I really like your usual look	 Wind	 but this
one is beautiful	 too!
MP106603	AAAAAA==	I second that.|It suits you.
MP106608	AAAAAA==	If it were me...
MP106609	AAAAAA==	Hmm... I think it would be nice to dress up
like a character I loved as a child.
MP106610	AAAAAA==	But even if it were to change to something
completely different to my current outfit	 I
have the feeling I'd really embrace it.
MP106611	AAAAAA==	Maybe it'd be like Queen's?|Something like Closer's?
MP106613	AAAAAA==	I really love that big hood. And the color is
super cute	 too!
MP106614	AAAAAA==	But I have to say that I really admire the
traditional Japanese theme of yours	 Wind!
MP106700	AAAAAA==	No	 I mean... Surely it's more reasonable to
assume she saw wrong?
MP106702	AAAAAA==	What's going on?|Is this about Violet?
MP106703	AAAAAA==	Oh hey	 Wonder. There's something we should
maybe run past you.
MP106705	AAAAAA==	We're trying to figure out what it possibly
could have been.
MP106706	AAAAAA==	At first I thought it was a Shadow	 but they
probably can't enter this space...
MP106707	AAAAAA==	I thought maybe she was mistaken. But if
that's what she says she saw...
MP106708	AAAAAA==	Any other details?|Where did she see it?
MP106710	AAAAAA==	So	 it seems it is not one of Wonder's allies
either. Simply discussing the matter isn't
getting us any closer either...
MP106711	AAAAAA==	So	 what do you think? Should we investigate?
MP106713	AAAAAA==	Of course.|I'm in.
MP106714	AAAAAA==	Come to think of it	 I
was walking around there with
Lufel on my shoulder earlier.
MP106715	AAAAAA==	I should go mention this
to Violet later...
MP106800	AAAAAA==	Wonder-senpai	 have you ever tried that
eating challenge at the burger shop?
MP106801	AAAAAA==	Ah	 but in your world	 there's no Big Bang
Burger	 right?
MP106802	AAAAAA==	What do you have to do?|We have something similar...
MP106804	AAAAAA==	There's a place like that.|We've got something similar.
MP106805	AAAAAA==	Oh	 I see! Even in different worlds	 some
things are the same.
MP106806	AAAAAA==	You say it's similar... So what's different?
Is it a teriyaki burger or something?
MP106808	AAAAAA==	I just know I can beat it!
MP106810	AAAAAA==	Shocked?|You mean it was big?
MP106812	AAAAAA==	Hey	 that's pretty normal! Regular exercise
will take care of it in no time!
MP106814	AAAAAA==	Joker-senpai!
MP106815	AAAAAA==	Violet appears to have
quite the appetite...
MP106900	AAAAAA==	Cattle looks like an animal of sorts	 just
like Mona	 right?
MP106902	AAAAAA==	Nothing really...
MP106903	AAAAAA==	But you said that you can't fly in that form	
so I wondered if you could fly in real life.
MP106904	AAAAAA==	Which is it exactly?
MP106905	AAAAAA==	He can.|No	 he can't.
MP106911	AAAAAA==	So	 what do you do in that case? Oh	 wait.
If my theory is correct...
MP106912	AAAAAA==	You maybe do it like this?
MP107000	AAAAAA==	I love meat	 too! I often have to hold off on
it before a match	 though...
MP107001	AAAAAA==	Hey	 Cattle	 what's your very favorite
kind of meat?
MP107004	AAAAAA==	Grilled frankfurters! You're quite the
gourmand	 aren't you	 Cattle!
MP107006	AAAAAA==	Oh wow! That sounds like something a phantom
thief would say! So cool!
MP107007	AAAAAA==	So	 what else do you eat besides
frankfurters?
MP107008	AAAAAA==	Yakitori...|Boiled eggs...
MP107009	AAAAAA==	Wait...
MP107011	AAAAAA==	Oh	 it's just... Like Mona-senpai	 you said
you're not a real owl... right?
MP107012	AAAAAA==	However	 I'm pretty sure owls are exclusively
carnivorous... Is that correct?
MP107015	AAAAAA==	I-I suppose so?
MP107017	AAAAAA==	I had a very hard time
clearing things up
after that...
MP107100	AAAAAA==	It's hard to describe how
I feel right now...
MP107105	AAAAAA==	What is this?|Tell me what you found.
MP107150	AAAAAA==	What is this place...?
MP107153	AAAAAA==	You were waiting?|Why?
MP107159	AAAAAA==	What a bizarre phenomenon...
MP107160	AAAAAA==	If true	 then this place would
appear to reflect one's own
perception of reality...
MP107205	AAAAAA==	Will this cost money?|How do I use it?
MP107253	AAAAAA==	Is that what this does?|How do you use it?
MP107302	AAAAAA==	A home theater?|I think it plays movies.
MP107352	AAAAAA==	There's just this one?|Looks a bit lonely...
MP107402	AAAAAA==	A table and four seats...?|Don't tell me...
MP107452	AAAAAA==	A hunch?|Please	 lead the way.
MP107510	AAAAAA==	How can I find them?|Are they here today?

NpcDialog_151	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No one bats an eye at animals lurking about

NpcDialog_152	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You will never truly grow if you keep
relying on others for help.
NpcDialog_161	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a well-maintained instrument. It's
clear the owner must treasure this guitar.
NpcDialog_165	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A charming house.
NpcDialog_166	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It has a slight warmth to it.
NpcDialog_171	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	*cough* Better not to inhale much of this
smoke. Let's leave quickly if possible.
NpcDialog_173	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see no problem with having the desire to
win big from a small amount of money. But it
seems like few people are buying them...
NpcDialog_176	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Is this the fashionable mode of dress for

to an owl like me...
NpcDialog_181	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! Now here's an establishment

NpcDialog_182	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	One duet with yours truly	 what do you say?
NpcDialog_184	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A bargain... Few other words are so apt
at stoking human desire.
NpcDialog_187	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Ah	 visual narrative experiences!
A fine source of sensory stimulation.
NpcDialog_190	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph... This new film sounds quite
intriguing. Its title is well designed to
stoke desire.
NpcDialog_191	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Top American box office hit... Was that not

NpcDialog_330	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is quite the venerable old building.

days	 correct?
NpcDialog_334	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's nothing we need that way...
NpcDialog_337	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's nothing of interest around here.
NpcDialog_341	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 cigarette smoking is prohibited below the
age of 20... I suppose you're too young then!
NpcDialog_344	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No entry allowed for unaccompanied minors	 it seems.
NpcDialog_347	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This establishment appears to stay open all
night. At least the human desire for alcohol
seems unabated!
NpcDialog_351	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Fusion cuisine... Ah	 so they serve meat in
the styles of many lands! *shlurp*
NpcDialog_354	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Most goods needed for daily life can be found here	 it seems.
NpcDialog_357	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Sometimes a hand-written message conveys
one's feelings best	 don't you think?
NpcDialog_360	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems like there's someone
in the back of the store.
They must be getting ready...
NpcDialog_361	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With you being a high school student	
we won't be getting in here.
NpcDialog_365	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There's nothing of interest this way.
NpcDialog_367	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should go elsewhere.
NpcDialog_370	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This is a shopping district. Where the
police can't reach	 private security has
probably set up shop.
NpcDialog_374	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If they have meat dishes	 I'd love to join you	 however...
NpcDialog_375	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can't simply walk into a restaurant in my
owl form. Do get some juicy takeout for me.
NpcDialog_378	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should go elsewhere.
NpcDialog_379	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should go elsewhere.
NpcDialog_380	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would be inappropriate for you to go there.
NpcDialog_381	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What a delectable aroma... They must be
stewing pork. *shlurp*
NpcDialog_382	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've heard the flavor of pork varies between
shops. I'd love to try it from this
establishment sometime.
NpcDialog_385	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No entry for minors	 it seems.
NpcDialog_388	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should go elsewhere.
NpcDialog_389	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It would be inappropriate for you to go there.
NpcDialog_391	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There seem to be a variety of objects lined
up here and brought for whatever reason.
NpcDialog_394	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	We should go elsewhere.
NpcDialog_397	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The so-called owl feed they sell here looks
very unappetizing to me.
NpcDialog_401	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I've heard there exists such a thing as "revolving sushi."
NpcDialog_402	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But what do they revolve? The fish or the
rice? Hm? By the look on your face... both	
but surely not!?
NpcDialog_405	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Acupuncture could be a good way to relieve
any fatigue from our work in the Metaverse.
NpcDialog_406	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd like to try it myself	 if they're able to
accommodate owls.
NpcDialog_410	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No entry allowed for unaccompanied minors	 it seems.
NpcDialog_411	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With you being a high school student	
we won't be getting in here.
NpcDialog_421	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A selection of masterpieces that highlight the artisans' craftsmanship	 it seems.
NpcDialog_424	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Many humans seem to take particular interest
in clocks like these. Are you one of them?
NpcDialog_427	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Build your style from the ground up. Ah	
they mean you should buy clothes to match
your shoes.
NpcDialog_430	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I don't see what sets these wares above
those available at other shops... except
the prices.
NpcDialog_433	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The craftsman here might even be able to
create infiltration tools.
NpcDialog_437	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	With our umbrellas, you'll look forward
to the rain! Hmph	 I'll just take shelter
from it in your bag.
NpcDialog_440	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	ID photos? What on earth could they identify?
NpcDialog_443	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There doesn't seem to be anything this way.
NpcDialog_447	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I suppose those Tokyo-themed confections
are for tourists	 but they may be
worth trying!
NpcDialog_450	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If you buy a new bag	 do be sure it's one
I'll fit in!
NpcDialog_453	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Supposedly the clothes they display most
prominently are the most trendy.
NpcDialog_457	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Take a gander at those high-heeled shoes. It must take strict training to be able to walk in them...
NpcDialog_460	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoomph	 there's something familiar about
the music they're playing in here...
NpcDialog_480	E<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>ployee	Think you've got what it takes to hit a

NpcDialog_9961	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's not budging...
NpcDialog_9962	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems there's another condition for opening this door that we've yet to meet.
NpcDialog_9963	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	What do we do then?
NpcDialog_9964	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It may not be the right time for this door
to open. Let's try another time.
NpcDialog_9971	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That Shadow appears quite powerful... But we'll need to defeat it to proceed.
NpcDialog_9981	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Oh	 is that {NAME2}-chan?
NpcDialog_9982	Kayo <#000000	T	#FFFFFF>omiyama	Hmmm.
NpcDialog_10000	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I think that you lot might just have what
it takes to overcome any trial...
NpcDialog_268001	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ssip-Loving Student	I heard there was another accident yesterday.
NpcDialog_268002	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>enthusiastic Student	Huh	 imagine that.
NpcDialog_268003	C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>rious Student	There was an owl outside the window just now	 and it had some paper in its beak!
NpcDialog_268004	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Student	Seriously? You sure it wasn't a carrier pigeon?
NpcDialog_268005	D<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ydreaming Student	I'm living in the same city as Ikenami-kun	
so there's a chance we'll meet someday...
NpcDialog_268006	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Student	...Are you doing what makes you happy?
NpcDialog_268007	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Student	I feel like every time I want to do
something	 I don't feel like doing it
a minute later.
NpcDialog_268008	W<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ispering Student	I wonder how Tomoko is doing...
I hope she's feeling better.
NpcDialog_268009	Q<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ietly Arguing Student	Huh	 hang on a sec... Are you into her?
NpcDialog_268010	W<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ispering Student	Don't make it weird! After what happened to
her	 any normal person would be curious.
NpcDialog_268011	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>udly Arguing Student	It's so annoying when the train's late...
Having to get the late train slip and
everything is such a hassle.
NpcDialog_268012	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>utious Student	Yeah	 I don't wanna deal with any of that.
That's why I leave the house early.
NpcDialog_268013	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>udly Arguing Student	Seriously? Wow	 how do you even do that?
I'm always sleeping in right 'til the last
second.
NpcDialog_268014	M<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>llow Student	I stayed up way too late last night. I can barely keep my eyes open...
NpcDialog_268015	S<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ightly Tired Student	So sleepy... Just gonna put my head down...
NpcDialog_268016	R<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>mor-Obsessed Student	I heard the Subway Slammer turned out to be
a former baseball player!
NpcDialog_268017	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>interested Student	Huh	 imagine that.
NpcDialog_268018	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urmand Student	You know Miyazawa	 the food critic? He's on
a bunch of food shows	 and he streams too.
NpcDialog_268019	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urmand Student	He does this over-the-top bit where he
swings a pen around like a sword.
It's pretty funny.
NpcDialog_268020	U<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>interested Student	Oh	 the Katana Tongue guy? I'm not really into his stuff.
NpcDialog_268021	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>seball-Loving Student	I was a big fan of Kiuchi back when he
played. I never thought he'd turn out
like this...
NpcDialog_268022	R<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>served Student	I always see you hanging around with Arai
these days. Are you friends or something?
NpcDialog_268023	Q<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ietly Discussing Student	I hear that celebrity critic Miyazawa
accepts bribes from restaurants to be
mentioned on his show.
NpcDialog_268024	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Student	Whoa	 that totally sounds like a Menace thing to do.
NpcDialog_268025	O<#000000	p	#FFFFFF>en-Minded Student	Ooh	 do you think Magatsukami knows about it
yet? We should post about it!
NpcDialog_268026	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Student	Oh	 good idea! Maybe Magatsukami will comment
on it!
NpcDialog_268027	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ee-Thinking Student	You guys are so weird... Obviously the best
way to know if a restaurant is good is to try
the food yourself.
NpcDialog_268028	Free-Thin<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ing Student	Don't put so much stock in reviews.
NpcDialog_268029	Fun-Lo<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>ing Student	I heard Miyazawa's bringing a contestant onto his stream.
NpcDialog_268030	Fun-Lo<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>ing Student	Gotta be a publicity stunt. It's all
scripted	 y'know? He'll just tear the guy
to shreds in the end.
NpcDialog_268031	Cool-Hea<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ed Student	I dunno... There was something weirdly real
about the way Miyazawa talked about it.
NpcDialog_268032	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ol-Headed Student	Like he was surprised by his own script or something.
NpcDialog_268033	Fun-Lo<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>ing Student	It doesn't really matter who wins as long as the show is fun	 right?
NpcDialog_268034	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Hey	 you know about that Divine Judgment website	 right?
NpcDialog_268035	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	The owner	 Magatsukami	 really impresses me.
I wonder where he gets all that info.
NpcDialog_268036	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Maybe Magatsukami is actually more than one
person? I could see the website being run by
a group.
NpcDialog_268037	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	It seems Tomoko Noge has been hospitalized	
after being hurt on the subway.
NpcDialog_268038	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	I heard she was actually trying to protect the second-year Motoha Arai at the time of the attack...
NpcDialog_268039	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	And this attack was from the Subway Slammer people have been talking about?
NpcDialog_268040	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Yeah	 that's the one. Apparently	 the Subway
Slammer was actually targeting Arai!
NpcDialog_268041	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	This sounds like it could make a good
article. But what to do for the headline...
NpcDialog_268042	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Female Student N Injured Guarding Friend A‚Äî
Friend Gets to School Unharmed?
NpcDialog_268043	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	That makes it sound like the friend
abandoned her! That's no good.
NpcDialog_268044	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	But it's true	 right? Arai did come to school afterward.
NpcDialog_268045	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Because they only let family come to the hospital with you! Cut the trashy tabloid stuff	 man.
NpcDialog_268046	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Student	Diners are just the right level of noisy for studying.
NpcDialog_268047	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>mposed Student	Except when it gets really busy	 then that's too loud...
NpcDialog_268048	P<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rceptive Student	I hear there's a good model figure shop in
Shibuya	 but the manager's kind of scary...
NpcDialog_268049	A<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rsoft-Loving Student	Wanna go together then?
NpcDialog_268050	P<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>rceptive Student	Yes	 please! You've really got to see the stuff they have in stock there.
NpcDialog_268051	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	There's been a big uptick in celebrity critics lately.
NpcDialog_268052	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urmand Student	A lot of the places the new guys recommend
aren't that good	 honestly.
NpcDialog_268053	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	I've got an idea! We should make an
investigative article about one of
these restaurants.
NpcDialog_268054	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	We can go to places recommended by these
critics and verify their claims.
NpcDialog_268055	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Then we can rank the celebrity critics based
on how dishonest they are!
NpcDialog_268056	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	If the kid who picked a fight with Miyazawa
is a Kokatsu student	 we'd have the scoop!
NpcDialog_268057	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Ah	 I can't wait for that Food Fight video!
NpcDialog_268058	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ushing Student	C'mon	 I just want you to tell me
Nishino-kun's digits!
NpcDialog_268059	B<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>bbly Student	Why're you asking me anyway? I don't even
know them that well...
NpcDialog_268060	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ushing Student	I heard a rumor you do anything people ask!
NpcDialog_268061	Bub<#000000	b	#FFFFFF>ly Student	Seriously? What kind of a rumor is that?
NpcDialog_268062	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ushing Student	I mean	 if you won't do it	 you won't
do it... But you will	 right?
NpcDialog_268063	B<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>bbly Student	...Fine	 let me hear you out.
NpcDialog_268065	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>end-Following S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	That thing about Miyazawa has gone viral	 huh.
NpcDialog_268066	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>stival-Loving S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	He was a pretty famous streamer and appeared on TV	 so it makes sense.
NpcDialog_268067	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>end-Following S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	I just feel bad for those restaurants he got shut down.
NpcDialog_268068	F<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>stival-Loving S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	Maybe they should sue him. It's Miyazawa's
fault they were put in such dire straits	
after all.
NpcDialog_268069	G<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urmand Student	Miyazawa's really ruining things for all the
real food critics out there!
NpcDialog_268070	A<#000000	p	#FFFFFF>athetic S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>udent	Yeah	 hearing about him did make me wonder
if all of 'em take money to lie about food.
NpcDialog_268071	P<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ilosophical Student	All the fall of Miyazawa means...
NpcDialog_268072	P<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ilosophical Student	...is that his seat is open for someone else
to take. Hah	 it'll be a critic bloodbath.
NpcDialog_268073	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ne Wolf Student	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun... Are you talking
to me because you want to be friends?
NpcDialog_268074	L<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ne Wolf Student	You'd better discard that idea. Friendship
only robs us of our freedom.

NpcDialog_271003	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>stless Boy	Me neither. It's not like we have any hope of
winning the competition anyway...
NpcDialog_271004	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>pressed Boy	I wonder how Tomoko's recuperating...
We should go visit her!
NpcDialog_271005	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>stless Boy	Some guys she's never met showing up at her
bedside? That'd probably terrify her	 man.
NpcDialog_271006	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>pressed Boy	Dude	 I'm achin' all over after PE class...
NpcDialog_271007	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>stless Boy	You're just out of shape	 man.
NpcDialog_271008	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>pressed Boy	Tomoko finally came back to school! Seems like she's doing good!
NpcDialog_271009	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>stless Boy	That's great. You not harassing her at the
hospital really paid off.
NpcDialog_271010	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	I wish guys would fall all over me IRL like they do in dating sims...
NpcDialog_271011	Worried-Lo<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>king Girl	Well then stop playing games and start
leveling up in real life.
NpcDialog_271012	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	Let's go back to that caf√© after school!
NpcDialog_271013	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	You just wanna flirt with that barista there	 don't you?
NpcDialog_271014	Girl Lo<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>king Afar	Huh? How did you know?
NpcDialog_271015	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	You haven't shut up about him since the last time we went.
NpcDialog_271016	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	Let's go get ramen at Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku!
NpcDialog_271017	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	What about that barista from the caf√©!?
NpcDialog_271018	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	It's good to diversify your diet every now
and then!
NpcDialog_271019	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	Uh-huh	 sure. So you found a new hot guy at the ramen shop.
NpcDialog_271020	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	Maybe I did	 but so what! The ramen's good too!
NpcDialog_271021	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	Fair enough. Let's go.
NpcDialog_271022	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	Are we going for ramen again today?
NpcDialog_271023	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	No. I'm never going there again...
NpcDialog_271024	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	Did something happen?
NpcDialog_271025	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	I have decided to devote body and soul to the Stone Lord...
NpcDialog_271026	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	New game fixation	 got it. Guess I'll have
time now to work part time after school then.
NpcDialog_271027	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	Kano-kun is kind of hard to approach	
but isn't he kind of hot too?
NpcDialog_271028	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	He has a distinctive vibe	 for sure.
NpcDialog_271029	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	If I ever find that Slammer	 I'll punch his
lights out! What kind of creep targets girls
like that!?
NpcDialog_271030	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	Yeah	 what a scumbag. I'll cheer you on!
NpcDialog_271031	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	Wait... You wouldn't help me fight him?
NpcDialog_271032	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	I'd... call the police for you...?
NpcDialog_271033	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	I heard the Subway Slammer got arrested. Serves him right.
NpcDialog_271034	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	I hope he rots in prison. If they let him
out	 he'll just start doing the same
stuff again!
NpcDialog_271035	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	*sigh*
NpcDialog_271036	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	Everything OK?
NpcDialog_271037	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	My favorite Chinese restaurant in Zoshigaya
has been closed for ages...
NpcDialog_271038	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	Maybe you could try another place in the meantime?
NpcDialog_271039	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	No	 it has to be that restaurant! No other
Chinese food can satisfy me!
NpcDialog_271040	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	Well when you put it like that... It makes me want to try this place too.
NpcDialog_271041	E<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>static Girl	Riko-senpai looked like she was having fun
talking to Motoha...
NpcDialog_271042	J<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>alous Girl	I wish she'd talk like that with us...
NpcDialog_271043	Ec<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>tatic Girl	I'm worried about Riko-senpai... What if she
was attacked on the subway and injured?
NpcDialog_271044	J<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>alous Girl	Don't worry	 Riko-senpai could incinerate
that Subway Slammer with her majestic aura!
NpcDialog_271045	E<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>static Girl	Yesterday	 I actually spoke to Riko-senpai!
I said hello	 and she said hello back...
NpcDialog_271046	J<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>alous Girl	She's so kind and gracious... I should
work up the courage to greet her	 too	
if I see her.
NpcDialog_271047	E<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>static Girl	Just passing Riko-senpai in the hallway makes
me feel like my soul's been purified...
NpcDialog_271048	J<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>alous Girl	......
NpcDialog_271049	E<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>static Girl	Umetane's new product announcements are way
more interesting than that Miyazawa
guy's videos.
NpcDialog_271050	J<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>alous Girl	Of course they would be; it's Riko-senpai's
family business. Gotta go buy some after
school today.

NpcDialog_271056	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	Wait... R-Really?
NpcDialog_271057	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>shful Boy	Yeah	 I asked him for cooking tips and he
was really patient explaining everything!
NpcDialog_271058	Mild-Man<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>ered Boy	Huh. I didn't expect him to know how to cook.
NpcDialog_271059	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>shful Boy	Arai-san must be really worried about
Noge-san. I mean	 they're such good friends
and all.
NpcDialog_271060	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	I hope Noge-san's injuries aren't too bad.
NpcDialog_271061	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>shful Boy	It's great to hear they arrested that Subway
Slammer. He had the girls really scared.
NpcDialog_271062	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	I heard a lot of them were terrified to even
come to school. I'm glad they caught him.
NpcDialog_271063	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>shful Boy	There's this place I'd like to go	 but I can't really go alone...
NpcDialog_271064	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	Let's go together	 then!
NpcDialog_271065	Bash<#000000	f	#FFFFFF>ul Boy	Oh	 uhh... I don't know if going with another guy would help...
NpcDialog_271066	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	Huh? What kind of place is this?
NpcDialog_271067	Frustra<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ed Boy	I've given you plenty of time to think.
Can you please give me an answer already!
NpcDialog_271068	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	I still need a little more time! Just a little	 I swear!
NpcDialog_271069	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	You haven't been coming to press me for an answer recently.
NpcDialog_271070	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	Sorry	 I've been busy. Wait... Did you want
me to pressure you?
NpcDialog_271071	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	No	 no	 of course not!
NpcDialog_271072	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	......
NpcDialog_271073	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	There's a ramen place I've been wanting
to try. Do you want to go with me?
NpcDialog_271074	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	Like... on a date?
NpcDialog_271075	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	No	 it's just hard to get in there alone!
NpcDialog_271076	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	Well	 that's fine I guess. I'll come along.
NpcDialog_271077	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	Today is the day I'm finally going to get an answer from you!
NpcDialog_271078	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	So you still haven't noticed	 huh...
NpcDialog_271079	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	What do ya mean?
NpcDialog_271080	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	Oh	 come on...
NpcDialog_271081	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	What are you doing?
NpcDialog_271082	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	Shh	 not so loud!
NpcDialog_271083	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	Did you hear me...? I asked you what are
you doing?
NpcDialog_271084	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	I said keep quiet! Or I'll get caught!
NpcDialog_271085	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	By who?
NpcDialog_271086	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	Lemme guess	 it's the organization again...?
NpcDialog_271087	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	......
NpcDialog_271088	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	So what organization is after you today?
NpcDialog_271089	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	......
NpcDialog_271090	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	I can't say that out loud...
NpcDialog_271091	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	You really need to pick a premise and stick with it.
NpcDialog_271092	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	Are they after you again today?
NpcDialog_271093	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	Obviously!
NpcDialog_271094	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	But don't you need to keep quiet?
NpcDialog_271095	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	I'm sorry...
NpcDialog_271096	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	So	 how's it going?
NpcDialog_271097	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	One of them is hidden in the shadows over there	 and another two across the way...
NpcDialog_271098	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	And what organization are they from?
NpcDialog_271099	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	...
NpcDialog_271100	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	You still haven't decided that part	 have you?
NpcDialog_271101	P<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sing Boy	Why? Why do girls never talk to me?
NpcDialog_271102	P<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sing Boy	What kind of poses do girls even like...?
NpcDialog_271103	P<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sing Boy	I heard girls like men with an air of ennui
about them	 so I'm trying to project ennui!
NpcDialog_271104	P<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sing Boy	I think this spot is lacking ennui. I should
try somewhere else.
NpcDialog_271107	D<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>pressed Boy	I heard that Noge-san is doing several part-time jobs.
NpcDialog_271108	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>stless Boy	Where did you even hear that?
NpcDialog_271109	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	Ah... Lord Ruby is so cool. I wish men like
him really existed.
NpcDialog_271110	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	I like Lord Aquamarine!
NpcDialog_271111	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	I got another call from Lord Ruby today!
I feel so loved...
NpcDialog_271112	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	It's the same with Lord Aquamarine. I get new
messages from him every day!
NpcDialog_271113	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	But I might have to give up on him...
NpcDialog_271114	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl Looking Afar	Why? You've been so hyper focused on
Aquamarine!
NpcDialog_271115	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried-Looking Girl	They announced Lord Emerald on social media
yesterday	 and now my heart is his!
NpcDialog_271116	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	That restaurant in Shibuya you recommended was great!
NpcDialog_271117	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	Really? Well	 my current recommendation would
be that caf√© in Zoshigaya.
NpcDialog_271118	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>dding Girl	Trends change too fast...
NpcDialog_271119	N<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nchalant Girl	Once a place gets enough buzz around it	
it becomes too crowded. You have to keep up!
NpcDialog_271120	E<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>static Girl	Riko-senpai is so cool and kind. She's like a
lone flower at the top of a mountain...
NpcDialog_271121	J<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>alous Girl	I know what you mean. She has that unapproachable kind of beauty.
NpcDialog_271122	E<#000000	c	#FFFFFF>static Girl	Exactly. But the more she feels beyond my
level	 the more I like her...
NpcDialog_271123	Inner Thoughts	It's the pair that's usually here...
NpcDialog_271124	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>shful Boy	I feel like I can't pick a place to eat
without checking the reviews first.
NpcDialog_271125	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	People who write that stuff write way too much... Like that Katana Tongue Miyazawa guy.
NpcDialog_271126	B<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>shful Boy	I get so stressed about missing out on a
great meal or getting a bad one	 I
have to check.
NpcDialog_271127	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ld-Mannered Boy	Wherever we end up at is fine with me.
If it's bad	 it'll just be a funny story
later!
NpcDialog_271128	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	Please go out with me!
NpcDialog_271129	W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rried Girl	Huh!? You can't just say that out of the blue!
NpcDialog_271130	Worried Gi<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>l	Who even are you	 anyway!?
NpcDialog_271131	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ustrated Boy	I... I sense I've made a grave miscalculation in how to start this conversation!
NpcDialog_271132	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	Oh	 you're being targeted again!
NpcDialog_271133	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	Shh! If you know what's happening	 then you know you need to keep quiet...
NpcDialog_271134	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	Any new twists in the plot?
NpcDialog_271135	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	Quiet	 please...
NpcDialog_271136	Confu<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>ed Girl	I'll take that as a no...
NpcDialog_271137	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	......
NpcDialog_271138	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	Really	 nothing?
NpcDialog_271139	Chu<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>nibyou Boy	This isn't fiction! New assassins don't just
pop up whenever you want.
NpcDialog_271140	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>nfused Girl	I see...
NpcDialog_271141	P<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sing Boy	I guess I'll just think of it like following
a manga that's on hiatus then.
NpcDialog_2102001	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perfect timing. There is something I wish
to discuss with you.
NpcDialog_2102002	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A curious space has opened up within the
Metaverse. It's not urgent	 but it may well
be worth investigating...
NpcDialog_2102003	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Well	 do let me know if you change your mind.
NpcDialog_2102004	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	This is the place. Let's head in.
NpcDialog_2102006	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	We're here!
NpcDialog_2102010	Riko Ta<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>emura	AAAAAA==
NpcDialog_281001	Mi<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>dle-Aged Housewife	The couple who lives there are overseas
right now	 you know? But they didn't take
their son with them!
NpcDialog_281002	Young W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	He's in high school	 isn't he? Should we be
worried about him?
NpcDialog_281003	M<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ddle-Aged Housewife	He's a good kid	 very mature. He always
greets me in the morning	 unlike my children!
NpcDialog_281004	Young W<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>man	My kids don't have manners like that either...
NpcDialog_291001	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	We've got a club meeting today!
See you there!
NpcDialog_291002	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	I'm always hanging out here	 unless it's raining!
NpcDialog_273000	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Hi	 {NAME1}-kun!
NpcDialog_273001	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Good work today!
NpcDialog_273002	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Hello!
NpcDialog_273003	R<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>tsuka Takanashi	Sure!
NpcDialog_273010	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	The soccer team is looking for new players!
Everybody's welcome	 whether you've played
before or not!
NpcDialog_273011	Yota Kurosa<#000000	w	#FFFFFF>a	If you're interested in joining	
just let us know!
NpcDialog_272200	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	You need something? I'm pretty busy getting
info on the new Menace right now...
NpcDialog_272202	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Oh? Are you not familiar with Menaces?
NpcDialog_272203	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Huh... I'd never have guessed. I thought
everyone knew by now.
NpcDialog_272204	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	That means I get to show you why they call me
the ace of the newspaper club!
NpcDialog_272205	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Ask me anything about Menaces! I'll tell you
everything I know.
NpcDialog_272208	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	It's hard to say what exactly makes a Menace
a Menace	 but broadly speaking	 they're
people who trouble others.
NpcDialog_272209	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Basically	 Divine Judgment reports people
committing wrongdoings that aren't
forbidden by law...
NpcDialog_272210	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	And the culprits are called Menaces.
NpcDialog_2102011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom? What is it? You need my assistance?
NpcDialog_272211	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Things have been a little different lately	 though.
NpcDialog_272213	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Since Divine Judgment has gotten popular	
you get people who are purposefully trying to
get on there.
NpcDialog_272214	News C<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>b Female Student	Some people have taken pretty extreme
measures to get labeled a Menace.
NpcDialog_272215	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Lately	 some of them have gone past skirting
the law to outright breaking it.
NpcDialog_272216	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	That's why the title Menace applies to a
fairly wide variety of people now.
NpcDialog_272217	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	You'd think the police would handle this kind
of thing	 but they actually don't!
NpcDialog_272218	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	For one thing	 there are just too many
Menaces reported on Divine Judgment.
NpcDialog_272219	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	For another	 their misdeeds span from pranks
to actual crimes and everything in between.
NpcDialog_272220	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Just think about how much manpower it would
take to fully investigate every one of them...
NpcDialog_272222	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Yeah	 basically.
NpcDialog_2102016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perfect timing. There is something I wish
to discuss with you.
NpcDialog_2102017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A curious space has opened up within the
Metaverse. It's not urgent	 but it may well
be worth investigating...
NpcDialog_2102018	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Very well. Do let me know if you change
your mind.
NpcDialog_272223	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Furthermore	 if you investigate one Menace
incident	 it'd be unfair not to do the rest...
NpcDialog_272224	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	So as long as no one gets killed	 I don't
think the police will get directly involved.
NpcDialog_272225	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	I guess it's a legal thing where the police
can't get involved with civil disputes.
Blegh.
NpcDialog_272226	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	About Menaces? Well	 I'd say most people
don't like them.
NpcDialog_272227	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	But they have their fans too‚Äîor should I
say	 their followers.
NpcDialog_272228	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	I guess it's kinda like how badboys used to
be popular back a few decades ago?
NpcDialog_272230	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Yeah	 that's a normal reaction	 I think.
NpcDialog_272231	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	But it's not like the people who hate the
Menaces do anything to stop them	 either.
NpcDialog_272232	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	It's all somebody else's problem until it
affects you personally	 y'know?
NpcDialog_272233	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	People like to yap about it online	 but that
just ends up as free publicity
for the Menaces.
NpcDialog_272234	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	And you know what they say about publicity
it's never really bad. Especially these days.
NpcDialog_272235	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	Sometimes you have to throw up your hands and call the whole world crazy.
NpcDialog_272236	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Girl	If there's anything else you want to know	
just ask. I'd be happy to share what I can.
NpcDialog_272300	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Hm? You need something? I'm kinda busy
checking the Divine Judgment story
right now...
NpcDialog_272301	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Hang on a sec! You... You look like someone
who knows a thing or two about Divine
Judgment.
NpcDialog_272303	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	You don't need to hide it	 I can see right
through such feigned ignorance.
NpcDialog_272304	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Go on then	 ask me anything. You'll see what
makes me the real newspaper club ace!
NpcDialog_272307	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	In the simplest terms	 Divine Judgment is
Magatsukami's website for reporting Menaces.
NpcDialog_272308	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	It's where people can share any information
they have about Menaces who are
causing trouble.
NpcDialog_272309	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Hm... It might be easier to just let you see
it for yourself.
NpcDialog_272310	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Look. This is the Divine Judgment homepage.
NpcDialog_272311	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	You can post images	 videos	 and text.
Though	 as you can see for yourself... 
NpcDialog_272312	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Text-only posts are easy to miss. Image and
video posts are just more attention-grabbing.
NpcDialog_272314	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Anyone can view it	 yes. To post	 you have to
become a registered user first.
NpcDialog_272315	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	But registration is quick and doesn't ask
for that much info. It's a low barrier
for entry.
NpcDialog_272316	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	The number of registered users has already
passed several hundred thousand and is
still rising...
NpcDialog_272317	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	The media has been talking about it a lot
recently too. It's kind of a "thing" now
I guess.
NpcDialog_272318	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Those are Menaces that have been officially
recognized by Magatsukami	 the site owner.
NpcDialog_272319	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	They're chosen from among the many Menaces
that are posted on Divine Judgment.
NpcDialog_272320	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Magatsukami produces videos that call
attention to certified Menaces...
NpcDialog_272321	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	And in some cases	 Magatsukami performs
follow-up investigations	 apparently.
NpcDialog_272323	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	That's a tough one to answer.
NpcDialog_272324	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Some people think it's decided based on the
number of comments and dislikes from users.
NpcDialog_272325	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	But Magatsukami has never officially confirmed what the selection criteria are.
NpcDialog_272326	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	So we can't rule out the possibility that
Magatsukami just picks them arbitrarily.
NpcDialog_272327	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	Personally	 I think there are upsides and
downsides to Divine Judgment.
NpcDialog_272328	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	On one hand	 it could prevent future harm by
publicizing information about Menaces...
NpcDialog_272329	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	On the other hand	 it could also be used
to harass or even dox people over
petty grievances.
NpcDialog_272330	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	And while Magatsukami does delete posts that
are clearly connected to personal
information leaks...
NpcDialog_272331	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	The huge number of posts on the site means
most posts	 i.e. the ones that toe the line	
get ignored.
NpcDialog_272333	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	I understand your concerns...
NpcDialog_272334	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	But to some extent	 these are the same
problems all social media sites have.
NpcDialog_272335	N<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>wspaper Club Boy	In that respect	 I think it's unreasonable
to single out Divine Judgment for that.
NpcDialog_310000	Me<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>ope	I think that you lot might just have what
it takes to overcome any trial...

Ro10101	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Middle-Aged S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	So... tired... Need... to sleep...
Ro10102	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Middle-Aged S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But I can't... Gotta stay strong. My favorite
idol's new album comes out today...
Ro10103	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Middle-Aged S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	If I can't stay awake	 I'm gonna miss out on
those super limited-edition bonuses...
Ro10104	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Middle-Aged S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But I don't know if my body can take it.
Maybe a quick rest wouldn't hurt...
Ro10111	T<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>red Middle-Aged S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	So... sleepy...
Ro10201	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	These are the scratch-off tickets we sell at
my store. Every card's a winner	 or so
they say.
Ro10202	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Yesterday a customer came in and bought up
a hundred of them	 and apparently ten of
them won.
Ro10203	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Lucky guy...
Ro10204	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But I've actually never tried buying one of
these myself.
Ro10205	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My wife tells me I should just focus on work
and earn my pay diligently. But...
I wonder...
Ro10211	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Eh	 you're right. I never have any luck.
Ro10221	S<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ore Owner's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Hm. Well	 it's better than losing.
Ro10301	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	What does it mean to be in love?
Ro10302	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	He said he'd come back to meet me	 and I
believed him	 so we started a long-distance
relationship...
Ro10303	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But he always says he's busy	 so we haven't
seen each other even once since then.
Ro10304	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	We still text and talk online	 but I still
can't help worrying... Should I still
trust him?
Ro10311	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Hmm... Yeah. You're right. It'll work out...
Because we love each other.
Ro10312	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Thanks for listening to me.
Ro10321	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Another option	 huh...
Ro10322	G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	...Thanks. I'll think about this a bit more.
Ro10401	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I've been in a long-distance relationship
with my girlfriend	 but we haven't had a
chance to meet up at all.
Ro10402	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	We still text and talk online sometimes	
but lately I've just been so busy...
Ro10403	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I promised her we'd definitely meet up
this time	 but I still feel so useless.
Ro10404	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	At this point	 maybe it'd be better to just
break things off...
Ro10411	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You're right. I made a promise	 after all.
I've gotta go see her!
Ro10421	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Yeah	 I can't really ask you to decide this
for me.
Ro10422	B<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>y's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'll think it over a bit more. Thanks.
Ro10501	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'm visiting my folks back home in the
countryside tomorrow.
Ro10502	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My mom's making dinner	 and she asked if
I'd rather have tonkatsu or steak...
Ro10503	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	How the heck am I supposed to choose!?
Those both sound amazing!
Ro10504	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	That perfectly crispy tonkatsu	 or a
mouthwateringly juicy steak...
Ro10505	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Aaahh! No way! I can't choose!
Hey	 which one do I pick?
Ro10510	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Yeah... I was thinking the same thing!
But	 then again... Aahhh...
Ro10511	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Yeah... I was thinking the same thing!
But	 then again... Aahhh...
Ro10512	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>sitant Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Maybe... I should've gone with tonkatsu
after all...
Ro10701	Ke<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>n Saleslady S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	They were having a sale on lucky bags	 so I
just bought as many as I could	 but maybe I
got too many...
Ro10702	Ke<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>n Saleslady S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You there! Would you be interested in buying
one of these?
Ro10703	Ke<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>n Saleslady S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Both of them are still sealed	 so even I
don't know what's in them.
Ro10704	Ke<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>n Saleslady S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Pick whichever one you like!
Please	 I insist!
Ro10711	Ke<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>n Saleslady S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Thanks! You were a huge help!
Ro10721	Ke<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>n Saleslady S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I see... No problem. I'll just lug both of
these back home.
Ro10801	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My daughter was just born recently.
Ro10802	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	She really is such a cute little girl...
Ro10803	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'd do anything to make sure my wife and
daughter are happy.
Ro10804	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But the results of my last health checkup at
work weren't so great...
Ro10805	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's nothing life-threatening	 but the
doctor said it could get worse if it's
left unchecked.
Ro10806	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	The thing is	 the treatment looks like it'll
be pretty expensive.
Ro10807	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I've been saving up money for my daughter	
and I really don't want to dip into
those savings...
Ro10808	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Ah	 what am I supposed to do?
Ro10811	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I talked about it with my wife. If we work
together	 we should be able to make it
through this...
Ro10821	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You're right. It's worth putting some more
thought into this.
Ro10832	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Gah	 this really is tough... What should
I do?
Ro10822	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You've got a point. We can use our savings
now	 and I can keep working to save up
more for her later.
Ro10831	S<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ck Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I've got to take care of my own
health first.
Ro10901	J<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ck Frost	Hee-ho	 hey there! Whatcha got there?
Ro10903	J<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ck Frost	That jingle-jangle sound... It's irr-hee-sistable	 ho!
Ro10905	J<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ck Frost	I've gotta have 'em! Give 'em hee-here!
Ro11001	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah	 so good to see ya	 sweet pea!
Ro11002	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	I got a little somethin' for ya! Consider it
my way of sayin' thanks for always supportin'
my business!
Ro11003	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Go ahead and choose whichever one you like!
Ro11011	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Hope to see you again soon!
Ro11012	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Lookin' forward to seein' you again!
Ro11101	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's Shadow	Damn it... This is bad... This is real bad...
Ro11102	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I invested everything I had	 and it's gone.
Ro11103	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	This is a nightmare... This can't be real.
Please let me wake up!
Ro11104	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	N-No	 if I just... cut my losses...
I can find a way to earn it all back	
little by little...
Ro11105	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Ah	 shit... What the hell is my life!?
Ro11106	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	If I sell now	 all my investments will be
for nothing... But if I don't sell	 I've got
no cash left...
Ro11107	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	What... What should I do...?
Ro11111	I<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>vestor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Nothing but losses... This always happens
to me.
Ro11112	In<#000000	v	#FFFFFF>estor's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	How long can I put up with this? This is
just my life...
Ro11201	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Hmm... Asset management is pretty important	
don't you think?
Ro11202	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Of course	 I want all my clients to make
a profit.
Ro11203	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	This product here has a high yield	 and I
would certainly recommend investing in it.
Ro11204	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But	 of course... There's no guarantee	 so
it's a high-risk	 high-reward situation.
Ro11205	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	This	 on the other hand	 is a much safer
option! It's a guaranteed principal	 but not
as profitable as the other one...
Ro11206	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Well	 then	 which will it be?
Ro11211	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh	 yes	 I agree! The guaranteed principal
is a surefire success. I was thinking the
exact same!
Ro11221	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh	 yes	 I agree! Aggressive investment is
the only way to get ahead! I was thinking
the exact same!
Ro11222	F<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>nance Guru's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh no! It seemed so promising	 but luck
wasn't on our side...
Ro11301	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I... I'm not afraid of anything...
Ro11302	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Hyaa!? Wh-What was that noise?
Ro11303	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I-I'd better check it out... I c-can't just
run away like a coward.
Ro11304	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Gotta fight... Gotta fight! But I'm
just so scared!
Ro11311	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	We... We actually did it!
Ro11312	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Even though it was scary	 we pulled through
somehow... Maybe that's what it means to
be brave.
Ro11313	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Thanks so much! Now nobody will ever call
me a coward again!
Ro11321	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Y-You're right. It's much worse to just
stand here trembling like this!
Ro11322	H<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>ro-Loving S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Even I have courage! The courage to avoid
pointless battles!
Ro11401	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	*sigh*
Ro11402	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Huh? Oh. Right. OoOoOo!
Ro11403	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	*sigh* No reaction	 huh? I guess I'm not
cut out for this. Playing a ghost in a
haunted house and all.
Ro11404	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I hope my shift is over soon...
Ro11405	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Besides	 this place is scary enough without
me	 right? Why do I need to be here?
Ro11406	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	What do you think? Do you actually want
me to scare you?
Ro11411	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Huh...? But putting in effort sounds like
such a pain...
Ro11412	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Eh	 at least they're paying me. I guess
I can play along.
Ro11421	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	YoOoOoU... totally get it	 don't you?
Ro11422	G<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ostly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Well then	 I guess I'll take your advice.
Time to make like a ghost and... disappear.
I'm out of here.
Ro11501	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Gotta run	 gotta run!
Ro11502	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My scheduled delivery time is coming up	 but
the road's closed for construction!
Ro11503	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Gotta deliver this coffee while it's still
ice-cold	 or the customer's gonna complain!
Ro11504	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Maybe I'd be okay if I bought an insulated
bag	 but I still might not make it in time...
Ro11505	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I guess I could take a detour if I hurry...
Or should I just find a way to keep this cold?
Ro11511	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	That's right! There's no time to think!
Ro11521	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Good point. There's no point in rushing if I
get a bad review anyway.
Ro11601	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Gotta run	 gotta run!
Ro11602	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My scheduled delivery time is coming up	 but
the road's iced over... Whoa	 almost slipped!
Ro11603	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Shoot	 I can't keep up my usual speed
like this!
Ro11604	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Gotta deliver this coffee while it's still
piping hot	 or the customer's gonna complain!
Ro11605	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But slipping and getting covered in scalding
hot coffee would be even worse...
Ro11606	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Do I take my chances on those icy roads?
Or do I take my time and accept the
one-star review...
Ro11610	C<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>urier's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	*sigh* Not much I can do. I guess it's just
bad luck.
Ro11701	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I have in my hand three capsules.
Ro11702	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Take the red capsule	 and you can see
reality for what it truly is.
Ro11703	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Take the blue pill	 and continue believing
whatever you want to believe.
Ro11704	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	And then there's this white pill	 which
doesn't really have anything to do with this
whole situation at all.
Ro11705	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	So	 what'll it be? The choice is yours. Take
whichever one you want.
Ro11711	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	So	 you've chosen to face reality...
Well then	 I'm certain we'll meet again.
Ro11721	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Choosing to stay in Wonderland... I see.
Farewell.
Ro11731	T<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ugh Guy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You actually chose that one... Hm. Well	
that's probably okay	 I guess.
Ro11801	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Hey	 mister. Wanna play with me?
Ro11802	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I've got tons of trading cards and toys.
They're all super popular	 y'know.
Ro11803	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But my friends at school are all into some
other stuff... Nobody ever wants to play
the games I like.
Ro11804	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's no fun playing by myself all the time...
If I give you one	 will you play with me?
C'mon	 please?
Ro11811	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh	 my mom's calling for me	 so I've
gotta go. See you later!
Ro11901	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	...!?
Ro11902	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh. You surprised me. I thought you were
someone I know.
Ro11903	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Well	 whatever. Anyways	 I heard there's
a really nice pachinko machine here	
so I came to check it out.
Ro11904	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Sounds pretty hot. My buddy told me he made
over ten thousand yen in one go.
Ro11905	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Sweet deal	 right? When I heard that	
I brought along all my cash to try it out
for myself.
Ro11906	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's an investment	 right? You'll get more
back if you put more money in.
Ro12001	Fre<#000000	e	#FFFFFF>loader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	...!?
Ro12002	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh. It's you. Good to see ya again.
Ro12003	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'm headed to the game center today!
Ro12004	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	So	 get this... There's supposed to be some
pretty valuable prizes right now. And I know
which machines are easy to win. Heheh.
Ro12005	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Sure	 there's a tiny bit of luck involved...
But if you just keep trying	 you're
guaranteed to win.
Ro12006	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Thing is	 I didn't have any money	 but I
managed to sell some of my mom's jewelry
at the pawn shop...
Ro12007	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But I'm gonna win back way more than what
I sold it for. It was an investment	 right?
Ro12101	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	God dammit...
Ro12102	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh	 it's you again. My old friend.
Ro12103	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Well	 you see... My parents kicked me out of
the house... Those idiots...
Ro12104	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But I was smart! I talked them into giving
me a ten thousand yen bill before I left.
Ro12105	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Now	 let's see... Do I take this to the boat
races	 or the bike races?
Ro12106	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's an investment! This ten thousand yen is
gonna be the start of my new life.
Ro12107	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	All I've gotta do is hit it big. You get it	
right?
Ro12201	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Is this really all my life turned out to be?
Ro12202	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's not like I hate my job or anything	
it's just that...
Ro12203	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Aren't there places where I could make
better use of my talents?
Ro12204	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Maybe I should just quit my job and start
fresh! But then again	 if it doesn't
work out...
Ro12205	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Shoot! I need to make a decision	 but I've
got no idea what to do!
Ro12211	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	That's it! You only live once	 right? I've
gotta take my chances!
Ro12212	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But will any company even hire me?
What am I supposed to do with my life...
Ro12221	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>reer-Seeking S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You've got a point... Guess my current job
isn't so bad	 is it?
Ro12301	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mbling Addict's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Heheh...
Ro12302	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mbling Addict's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	That feeling of leaving everything up to
chance	 letting the whims of fate take hold
of your life...
Ro12303	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mbling Addict's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's irresistably thrilling! Heh heh...
Ro12304	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mbling Addict's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Don't you think so?
Ro12305	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mbling Addict's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Can you lay everything down	 and let
fate decide?
Ro12306	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mbling Addict's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's easy... You've just got to let go.
Think you can handle it?
Ro12401	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Young man	 will you take up my blade in
my stead?
Ro12402	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Ahaha. Sorry for springing this on you all
of a sudden.
Ro12403	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	I'm a cosplayer	 and this is a replica of a
sword from a video game...
Ro12404	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	As I was making it	 I started to think it
might not suit me.
Ro12405	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	But after taking all that time to craft it	
it seems like a waste to just throw it away.
So... do you want to take it?
Ro12410	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	R-Really? Haha	 thanks... I am pretty
proud of it.
Ro12411	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Boy's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Take good care of it	 okay?
Ro12501	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
Ro12502	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	...Sorry! Just a joke.
Ro12503	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	I make video game cosplay. I got an order
to make a replica of that famous shield from
that one game...
Ro12504	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	But the orders got mixed up	 and this is a
totally different character's shield!
Ro12505	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	So	 if you want	 you could take it...
Ro12510	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Seriously? Well	 if you're interested...
Thanks!
Ro12511	G<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>mer Girl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Here you go. Take care of it	 all right?
Ro12601	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	My grandson is always playing video games.
He even told me I look like one of
the characters.
Ro12602	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	He even said I should dress up as them.
That "cosplay" thing people are into.
Ro12603	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	But this character is a warrior who carries
a sword and shield...
Ro12604	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Where do folks even get that sort of thing?
Young man	 do you know anything about this?
Ro12610	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Oh! That's just wonderful! My grandson is
going to be delighted when he sees this.
Ro12611	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Thank you	 young man! Take this as thanks.
It was such a generous gift	 after all!
Ro12620	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Oh! That's very impressive. That'll probably
be enough on its own.
Ro12621	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Thank you. Here's a little something for
your trouble.
Ro12630	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Oh! That's very impressive. That'll probably
be enough on its own.
Ro12631	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	Thank you. Here's a little something for
your trouble.
Ro12640	Ga<#000000	m	#FFFFFF>er Grandpa's Sh<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>dow	I see... That's a shame.
Ro12701	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	A famous author once said that horse racing
is a reflection of life itself...
Ro12702	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Me	 I'd say the opposite. Life is just a
reflection of horse racing!
Ro12703	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	That horse I've had my eye on	 she's
definitely going to win today.
Ro12704	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I just know she's a winner... That's why
I keep betting on her!
Ro12705	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My hopes and dreams are all riding on
that horse!
Ro12711	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Ahh... She'll definitely win today.
She just has to!
Ro12712	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oof... No luck today either. It's always
like this... Horse racing is a reflection of
my life	 after all.
Ro12721	H<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>rse Racing Fan S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	It's... a bit embarassing hearing that from
a kid your age...
Ro12801	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Damn it	 don't give me any of that shit...
Ro12802	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	My goddamn boss is always pushing more work
on me and making me screw up.
Ro12803	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	He's always like	 "sorry	 can you take care
of this?" And then I end up working overtime
every single goddamn day!
Ro12804	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I can't take it anymore!
Ro12805	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I've had enough! This time I'm quitting!
I'm not playing games anymore! This
goddamn job...!
Ro12811	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'm just sick of covering up other people's
mistakes...
Ro12821	G<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>umbling Man's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I can't do this	 I just can't...
Ro12901	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	What should I do...?
Ro12902	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I went to that popular fortune teller the
other day	 and she said I had to "change my
life completely".
Ro12903	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Apparently if I don't make at least one
major change	 my luck is going to
take a turn for the worse...
Ro12904	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But what is there that I can even change?
Ro12911	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Right! That should help me feel more at ease.
Ro12912	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But... there's no way that'll be enough.
Is that really okay...?
Ro12913	A<#000000	s	#FFFFFF>trology Fan's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Ah	 what to do...
Ro13001	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ar's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	The person you see before you... is not
the real me...
Ro13002	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ar's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	The real me isn't just some
pathetic loser...
Ro13003	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ar's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	This is all just a dream.
A horrible dream...
Ro13004	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ar's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'm sleeping in my penthouse apartment	 and
when I wake up	 my beautiful wife and
children will be there...
Ro13005	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ar's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Don't tell me I'm avoiding reality!
This isn't... The real me is...!
Ro13011	L<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>ar's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'm not lying! Shut the hell up! I'd never
lie to anyone	 especially not myself! I...
I...!
Ro13101	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Today's youth have forgotten what it means
to pray...
Ro13102	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Through faith and prayer alone	 we can save
this world from impending disaster...
Ro13103	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Why	 oh why	 have people turned away
from prayer?
Ro13104	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Is this simply the inevitable march of time?
Ro13105	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You there	 young man... Won't you join me
in prayer?
Ro13111	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Thank you... Young man.
Ro13112	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	O Lord... Is this a sign? Are you telling me
it is better not to pray?
Ro13121	T<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>oubled Elderly S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I see...

Ro13803	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	That ten thousand yen from my parents was

part-time now...
Ro13804	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I think this experience has truly changed me.
I never realized how hard people work every
day just to save up a bit of money...
Ro13805	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I've gotta get out. I'm gonna buy a

Ro13806	F<#000000	r	#FFFFFF>eeloader S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	This one's a home-run! That money is gonna

Ro13902	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Lately	 I've been studyin' up on some new
business strategies!
Ro13903	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	One idea is to hand out Marthym-themed
shopping bags to all of my dear customers!
Ro13904	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	From what I hear	 it's somethin' folks
call "branding."
Ro13905	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Another plan is to create point cards for the
shop. Which idea do you think takes the win?
Ro13906	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	All righty	 that's settled. Thanks a
bunch	 sugar!
Ro14001	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>pable Girl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Alright. Time to start the second phase
of the experiment...
Ro14002	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>pable Girl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But there's not much time until the deadline
for my report... I might just have time for
a single test.
Ro14003	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>pable Girl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Right! Just one test should give us enough
data for our hypothesis.
Ro14004	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>pable Girl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	...Oh	 hey. Feel like helping with
an experiment?
Ro14005	C<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>pable Girl's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	I'd like you to choose one of these records
to listen to. Any one of them is fine!
Ro14101	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Hey	 do you know anywhere I could grow
plants? Somewhere with a lot of space so
they can grow really	 really big!
Ro14102	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Uh	 it's for homework. My teacher told us we
had to record the growth of plants.
Ro14103	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Check it out. I got these seeds! But I don't
really know where to plant them...
Ro14104	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Any idea where I could plant this?
Ro14111	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Really!? Then can you plant it for me? I'll
come see how it's doing later!
Ro14121	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Oh	 really? Then I guess I'll go look!
Ro14122	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Thanks	 dude! Here	 you can take this!
Ro14201	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Oh	 it's you! Did you bring the flower pot?
Ro14202	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Whoa	 it already got this big? I bet it'll be
a whole tree soon!
Ro14203	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	I heard if you want it to grow really big	
you have to give it lots and lots of water!
Ro14204	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	So should I water it some more?
Ro14211	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Oh	 I get it! Then I'll just wait and see.
Ro14212	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Thanks so much	 dude! See ya!
Ro14221	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Huh? I think we gave it a bit too much...
I don't think it'll grow any bigger now.
Ro14222	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	But thanks for all your help anyways!
Ro14223	Young G<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>rl's Sha<#000000	d	#FFFFFF>ow	Here	 you can have this!
Ro14301	Mart<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>ym	Ah	 so good to see ya	 sweet pea!

with me before!
Ro14402	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Lately	 my friends at school have started
playing with me.
Ro14403	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	They said it looked like a lot of fun when
I was playing with you	 so they wanted to
try it too!
Ro14404	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But they're not very good yet	 so it's still
way more fun to play against you.
Ro14405	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	So here. You can take this. It's one of my
most treasured cards!
Ro14406	Y<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>ung Boy's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Or	 if you want	 I've got a card case you

Ro14501	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>id's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	What should I do? I've just got no clue...
Ro14502	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>id's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Oh! You over there!
Ro14503	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>id's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	Could I have a minute? I need some advice!
Ro14504	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>id's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	You see	 I actually offered to help with this
event at my little brother's kindergaren...
Ro14505	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>id's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	But it turned out to be some kind of
superhero show! I don't know a single thing
about this stuff!
Ro14506	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>id's S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>adow	A hero's weapon is usually a sword	 right?
Or would a gun be better?

Maybe a few more...
Ro10921	AAAAAA==	He skipped away	 looking

SCH00001	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	What did Diogenes think we should do to free
ourselves from desire?
SCH00003	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	So you were listening... Tch.
SCH10001	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Howdy	 I'm Mr. Nagara	 your literature
teacher!
SCH10002	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Spring sure is in the air! I can feel your
youthful exuberance from here!
SCH10003	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	I sure do hope this old geezer can keep up
with you youngsters!
SCH10004	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Wait	 what am I saying!? I'm still in the
springtime of my life too!
SCH10005	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Thank you for indulging me in a few playful
word choices.
SCH10021	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Now then. I must stress that it's imperative
to respect that which is not yours	 even in
literature.
SCH10006	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	In fact	 there is a famous work that starts
with that very idea. Yes	 I'm talking about
the norm-breaking "The Tosa Diary"!
SCH10007	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	 correct? Here's an
easy question for you!
SCH10008	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Was the author of "The Tosa Diary" a man or
a woman?
SCH10010	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Well done! That's right!
SCH10011	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Indeed	 it was penned by none other than
Ki no Tsurayuki.
SCH10012	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Ah... Maybe you overthought that one?
SCH10013	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	The answer is a man. The author's name was
Ki no Tsurayuki.
SCH10014	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	It was actually written by a male author.
SCH10022	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH10015	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	It's Japan's oldest example of diary
literature	 and it shows respect to the
opposite sex.
SCH10016	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Respecting those different from you. That's
a skill I want to learn. Like...
SCH10017	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	It is generally a youth who imbibes what is
called bubble tea. But now an old man will
see what he can do.
SCH10018	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	The Stayin' Fresh Diary by Nagara no
Tsurayuki. What do you think? Just kidding!
SCH10019	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What do I even say to that?
SCH10020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Just watching this man is an ordeal.
SCH10023	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Howdy! Today	 we're covering "The Tales of
Ise." Specifically one man's journey long	
long ago to the east!
SCH10024	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Basically	 he left Kyoto because he saw
himself as an "eunakimono." In Old English	
that'd be something like "cumber-world."
SCH10025	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Any idea what that word would mean in
more modern terms? How about...
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
SCH10027	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Ding ding ding! Yep	 it's about him going on
a trip eastward after feeling useless and
heartbroken.
SCH10028	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Very creative	 but nope! The answer is
someone worthless	 useless	 or like a waste
of space.
SCH10029	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Azumakudari, or literally "going down to
the East	 is about a dejected man traveling
to relieve his heartbreak.
SCH10030,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,By the way, the protagonist is modeled after
Ariwara no Narihira, the biggest playboy
of the time.
SCH10031,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,Of course, it's not like women back then had
much say at all when it came to romance.
SCH10032,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,Even freedom of marriage is a new thing on a
global level, but that's just how it was back then.
SCH10033,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH10034,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,In fact, there's one about a princess who
refuses an arranged marriage and becomes
a pirate!
SCH10035,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,The famed pirate Awilda! I just love that
one! She was a fifth-century Scandinavian
princess.
SCH10036,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,It's up in the air if she really existed or
not, but I love that her story of choosing
her own path is still being told.

SCH10038,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,After all, isn't it proof that we've always

I'm being a real eunaki" teacher here!
SCH10041	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A legend acting as proof of desire through
its existence? An interesting view to be
sure	 but...
SCH10042	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Can't he calm down a bit? His enthusiasm is
putting a damper on my mood.
SCH10043	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	This story begins with the famous line	
Long ago, there was a man...
SCH10060	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	And that was the story of the Tale of Heike.
It seems that war never ends in any era...
How sad...
SCH10061	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	But let's put aside such dark tales for now.
Let us turn our discussion toward recent
events in countries abroad!
SCH10062	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Theives are in all places and times periods	
but accounts of "chivalrous thieves" stealing
for the good of the people also exist.
SCH10063	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	There are various rumors about these
chivalrous thieves	 such as they don't target
the poor and give away what they steal.
SCH10064	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	My favorite has to be Ghino di Tacco	 the
Italian chivalrous thief from
the 13th century!
SCH10065	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	He stole from the rich	 but never the poor.
There's even an anecdote about him providing
care to the sick and injured for free.
SCH10066	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	His conduct earned him the support of the
people	 and he was even given a nickname...
SCH10067	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Does anyone know what it might be? I'll give
you a hint... It perfectly describes yours truly!
SCH10068	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Our eyes have met	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
What was Ghino di Tacco's nickname?
SCH10070	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Correct! Yes	 it was "gentleman." Did
my hint make it too easy? Just kidding!
SCH10071	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	J-just what kind of image do you have of
me!? The correct answer is "gentleman."
See	 just like me!
SCH10072	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	To steal the heart's of the people and be
called a gentleman thief... He must have been
truly something to earn the such praise.
SCH10073	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	He was originally born into a noble family	
so I suppose he had his own virtues that he
wouldn't give up on...
SCH10074	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	A bandit who helps the weak and the poor...
A true gentleman thief! Isn't he just
the coolest!?
SCH10075	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Shouldn't teachers aim to be gentlemen who
are adored by their students like that?
Just kidding!
SCH10076	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I feel as though I'm still a bit lacking in
composure to be called a gentleman now...
SCH10077	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But it's good to have the desire to be
charming. Never back down and give it
your all too	 okay?
SCH10090	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Howdy! Today we'll be starting "The Tale of
Genji	 a true Japanese literature classic.
SCH10091,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,I'll do my darnedest to make sure you all get
why it's so amazing! And I'll try to not go
overboard with my enthusiasm, hahaha.
SCH10092,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,But I will say the way Kiritsubo is described
in the textbook doesn't get me very hype,
if I'm honest...
SCH10093,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,Speaking of which, Hikaru Genji's romantic
escapades are so well known and interesting!
SCH10094,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,Error: tkabnt-KB

SCH10096,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,So then... {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
SCH10097,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,What did women of the time find so
attractive about Hikaru Genji, the ultimate
playboy?
SCH10099,Mr. N<#000000,a,#FFFFFF>gara,Ah, did you say that because hikaru" means
to shine?
SCH10100	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Sorry	 the real answer was his wealth.
SCH10101	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Ah	 I see you're a careful reader.
That's right! It was his wealth.
SCH10102	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	After all	 he had enough money to have a
mansion built so he could live there with all
his romantic conquests.
SCH10103	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH10104	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	While the idea of a shared house between
lovers may seem pretty wild	 it wasn't so
bad for the time.
SCH10105	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	There were barely any jobs for women then	
so they would have needed a man to help
them find a place to live...
SCH10106	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Hikaru Genji wasn't someone who just threw
his past lovers to the curb. He gave them not
just a home	 but a certain lifestyle.

SCH10109	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	That's my theory	 at least.
SCH10110	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Guess it wasn't just his good looks that
shined	 but the coins in his purse too...
Just kidding!
SCH10111	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Problematic by today's moral
standards	 but his sense of loyalty toward

The Pillow Book.
SCH10121	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Sei Shounagon... Talk about beauty and brains!
Or at least I think so!
SCH10122	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	They often call her Lady Murasaki's rival.
SCH10123	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	But it's very likely that they'd never met.
SCH10124	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Their times at the imperial court were off by
four years. That's like you all being rivals
with a bunch of middle schoolers!
SCH10125	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	But	 despite their limited relationship	
they did collaborate...
SCH10126	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	In the "Hyakunin Isshu"! Yes	 the poetry
collection found now on karuta cards!
SCH10127	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	In it	 Lady Murasaki... On second thought	
I'll ask one of you.
SCH10128	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	 I saw you first	
so you answer this one.
SCH10129	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	A "kimariji" in karuta is the number of
recited syllables you need to identify
a card.
SCH10130	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	So what's the fewest number of syllables
that a kimariji can have in this game?
Give me your best shot!
SCH10132	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Whoa! Ding ding ding! Unbelievable!
Imight've underestimated you	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
SCH10133	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Ah... Maybe that was a bit of a toughie. The
correct answer is one!
SCH10134	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	There are seven cards with a kimariji of one.
Lady Murasaki's poem is among them.
SCH10135	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	They're remembered by their

SCH10152	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	The color of the sala flowers reveals the
truth that the prosperous must decline.
Heavens to Betsy	 that's good prose!

Taira no Kiyomori	 who died of fever.

23	500 haikus to be precise!
SCH10192	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	That comes out to about 16 poems a minute.

SCH10271	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	His name was Fujiwara no Michinaga. There's a fun story of him realizing he's cursed!
SCH10272	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	Really. Curses! They just loved that stuff
back in the Heian period. It was just
ghosts this	 spirits that!

SCH10274	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	I kind of get why they'd wanna curse each other.
SCH10275	Mr. N<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>gara	But people got cursed for a lot longer

foreign nations. Sounds like they just

SCH10288	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	His attitude would probably improve if he changed his outlook on things...
SCH10289	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But he'd even be a handful for those divine beings he mentioned earlier...

SCH20002	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I'm Ms. Katayama	 and I teach math and homeroom.

SCH20004	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	If you stay back too late	 your parents will start to worry.
SCH20005	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I don't want them thinking I'm some kind of bad influence on you all.
SCH20006	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	You know	 that reminds me of something...
How about a little warm-up question to
get the gears turning?
SCH20007	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Okay	 since I saw you first	 try answering
this	 {PLAYER_NAME}.
SCH20008	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	We can describe a person whose actions
negatively impact others as a certain rotting
fruit. Which fruit do you think that is?
SCH20010	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Unfortunately	 the correct answer is apple.
SCH20011	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Though scientifically speaking	 it could be any kind of fruit.
SCH20012	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Hm? Yes	 well done. The answer is apple.
SCH20013	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	As the old saying goes...
SCH20021	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	One bad apple spoils the whole barrel.
SCH20014	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	And by extension...
SCH20022	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...we use "bad apple" to refer to a person in
a group who causes problems for the others.
SCH20015	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	The phrase always reminds me of my least
favorite kind of apples: granny smiths.
SCH20016	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	And now I can't help but see delinquents as
sweet little old ladies. Their tough guy acts

SCH20017	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Hmm... I guess not. You don't run into many
bad apples these days	 I suppose.
SCH20018	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Anyway	 enough chit-chat. Let's move on
from apples and get into some math.

SCH20020	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 would that make you an elderly woman
as well? Or perhaps some other sort of
old bat. Hoohoohoo.
SCH20030	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Guess what? A friend recommended me
a biopic on a man named Rob Roy. His display
of altruism was truly amazing.

wigged jerk really had my heart racing!
SCH20035	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...I see you kids find older movies boring.
Sorry if I got a bit too carried away.
SCH20036	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Oh	 I know. Seeing as we're talking about
Rob Roy... how about a math question
involving cattle?
SCH20037	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It's known as Archimedes's cattle problem.
SCH20038	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It's all about how many cows you need.
SCH20039	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Try answering this	 {NAME1}-kun. Just think
of it as a fun little brainteaser.
SCH20040	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Archimedes's cattle problem was posed
around 250 BC. How many years did it take
to get solved?
SCH20042	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Nope	 even more. It took over 2	000 years.
SCH20043	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It was finally solved in 1965.
SCH20044	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Ah	 that's right! It took over 2	000 years.
SCH20045	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It was finally solved in 1965.
SCH20046	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	But I guess it is a bit unclear when exactly
it was posed by Archimedes	 so it's not like
it was this ever-unsolvable problem.

chasing some impossible dream?
SCH20049	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Time just kept passing and passing	 and yet	
there were always people toiling to find
the solution.
SCH20050	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Kind of like how Rob Roy lived.

SCH20060	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Let's see here... We were covering
the sine formula last time	 weren't we?

SCH20062	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It's actually pretty easy	 so we can just
jump right into it. First	 we circumcircle
an arbitrary triangle...
SCH20063	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Actually	 that reminds me... A student
in another class asked what makes
an arbitrary triangle arbitrary.
SCH20064	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It'd be good to check if you all understand
that before we're too deep in the lesson.

Give it your best shot.
SCH20068	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Ooh	 sorry. The right answer is any kind
of triangle.
SCH20069	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Great job. That's right	 it's any kind
of triangle.
SCH20070	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	More specifically	 it's just a way to say
every possible triangle is on the table.
SCH20071	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	The term "arbitrary triangle" is used when
the problem can be solved using
any triangle.

SCH20077	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It seemed pretty intuitive to me	 but I guess
it's math jargon.

SCH20090	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	That's right! The ending of a war. Don't get
me wrong	 though	 someone didn't stop a war
just with math.
SCH20091	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I mean... How could one individual ever do
that? But yes	 the answer is ending of a war.
SCH20092	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I'm talking about decrypting German codes
during the Second World War. Mathematicians
played a huge role in that	 you know.
SCH20093	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Marian Rejewski laid the groundwork for it

it up?
SCH20099	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Humans can be such irrational and incoherent
creatures. Though I suppose desire behaves in
much the same way.
SCH20100	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Let's continue from where we left off last class and jump into probability distributions.
SCH20101	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	These are numbers that describe a distribution.
SCH20102	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Let's start with a random variable's
expected value	 the average after
weighted probability.
SCH20103	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	You learned about averages in middle school	
right? They'll often pop up in online survey
results.
SCH20104	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Average summer bonuses	 average savings of 30-somethings...
SCH20105	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...average age to find a partner... That kind of thing.
SCH20106	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	But things can get confusing when you look
at the data. So why don't we review how to
do that?
SCH20107	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	How about... {NAME1}-kun today. Take a look
at this chart.
SCH20108	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	What's the best representative value
to use in order to express this sort
of data distribution?
SCH20110	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Ooh	 unfortunately not. It's best to use
the median here.
SCH20111	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Yes! The mean would be easily affected by
the extreme outliers...
SCH20112	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...so it's best to use the median here.
SCH20113	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Being below average might make you despair...
SCH20114	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	..but who knows	 maybe you're way above median!
SCH20115	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	That's why you should always make time to
ensure your data is being analyzed properly.
SCH20116	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	We all worry about how others see us...
SCH20117	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	That's why you should try to look at things in the best way!
SCH20118	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	But let's go back to probability
distributions. Okay	 everyone look at
practice question one...
SCH20119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'll never understand those who worry
about being less or more average.
Just worry about yourself	 I say...
SCH20120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How do you see your desires	 {NAME2}?
SCH20121	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	So	 one of the students in another class
won a local research prize.
SCH20122	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I've been roped into helping them prepare
a few things...
SCH20123	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...but I was so pleased to see their hard
work being rewarded	 I cried as if it was
my own award!
SCH20124	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	So I hope you all invest yourselves in math
just as much as they did. Enough to win
a Nobel Prize!
SCH20125	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Heheh	 only kidding... Oh	 but this might
make for a good question for the class.
SCH20126	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	This isn't so much math-related as it is
trivia	 but I'll ask anyway. Try answering
this	 {NAME1}-kun.
SCH20127	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	The Nobel Prize is awarded in a number
of fields	 but guess which field doesn't
get one.
SCH20129	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Sorry	 but there IS a prize for that field.
The answer is... math. Can you believe it?
SCH20130	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Yep	 that's right! There's no Nobel Prize
in math for whatever reason!
SCH20131	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	One popular theory is that a mathematician
stole Nobel's lover...
SCH20132	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH20133	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It sounds ridiculous	 I agree. But at the
same time... I kinda get it.
SCH20134	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	While it's important that we devote ourselves
to our studies	 it's only human to let our
emotions get the better of us at times.
SCH20135	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	But don't worry. In terms of world famous
awards for math	 there's still the Fields
Medal!
SCH20136	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Then again	 none of you look too worried...
Anyway	 enough chit-chat. Flip open to the
chapter on algebra	 please.
SCH20137	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The overly personal reason does make it seem
far truer than a nicely manicured life story.
SCH20138	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It seems all the more believable because
he was true to his desires.
SCH20139	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I'd even wager that doing so is the basis of
humanity's strength.
SCH20140	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Okay	 so be sure to remember this theorem...
SCH20141	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...to get the length of the midline
connecting the vertex on the triangle
and the midpoint on the other side.
SCH20142	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	When understood	 it can even be used in
geometric proofs	 so it's a surprisingly
convenient theorem.
SCH20143	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH20144	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	The fascinating thing about math is that
seeking efficiency can sometimes lead you
to common answers.
SCH20145	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH20146	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	And I'm not just talking about human
problem-solving either. Even bugs make
smart use of geometry.
SCH20147	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	{NAME1}-kun	 are you with us? Time for
a little mental workout.
SCH20148	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Beehives are made of many regular hexagons.
Why do you think that is?
SCH20150	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Well... I suppose that could be true as well?
I'm not an expert on bees.
SCH20151	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Mathematically	 they save on materials.
That was the answer I had in mind.
SCH20152	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Ah	 that's correct! I see you get what makes
regular hexagons special.
SCH20153	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Three regular polygons can be tessellated.
Triangles	 squares	 and hexagons.
SCH20154	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Circles are the shape with the shortest
perimeter. The closest to them of the three
polygons I mentioned are...
SCH20155	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	You guessed it. Regular hexagons. It lets
bees make hives while saving on labor and
materials.
SCH20156	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It's a pretty fascinating example	 isn't it?
See? Math can be cool!
SCH20157	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I never knew there was such intentional
design in their hives... Without that
knowledge	 one might never notice.
SCH20158	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The more knowledge we obtain	 the deeper
we can understand the world around us.
SCH20159	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It may even aid you in the strengthening
of your desire.
SCH20160	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Okay	 today let's do some applied calculus.
SCH20161	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Be careful	 it's easy to miss these problems
on tests.
SCH20162	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Especially the ones with unit conversions!
Kilo means 1	000. Don't forget that.
SCH20163	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Not that it matters in nations that use
the imperial system...
SCH20164	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Units are annoying	 I get it.
SCH20165	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	People use them without understanding what
they indicate all the time	 too.
SCH20166	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Hm	 like for example...
SCH20167	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Since you're who I saw first	 answer this
for me	 {NAME1}-kun.
SCH20168	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	What do you think the unit of carats
indicates when used in jewelry?
SCH20170	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I'm afraid not. Though I wouldn't expect
students to know much about gems	 anyway.
SCH20171	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It's weight. 1 carat is 0.2 grams.
SCH20172	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Wow	 color me impressed. Yes	 a unit
of weight. 1 carat is 0.2 grams.
SCH20173	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Doesn't it seem a little haphazard to weigh
minerals with different densities	 though?
SCH20174	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Oh	 but I guess they do use the momme for pearls.
SCH20175	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I want to say one momme is 3.75 grams?
SCH20176	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Did you know that momme is a Japanese unit?
SCH20177	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	It's used because we were the first to
successfully farm pearls.
SCH20178	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone
who knows what a momme is. Units can get
real complicated real quick	 huh?
SCH20179	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the weight of gems is important enough
that they command different units?
SCH20180	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Well	 the Treasure we seek is in
a class of its own...
SCH20181	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	And the term "carats" strikes me as rather
bizarre...
SCH20182	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So how about we measure Treasure in "Lufels"
instead? Now there's an idea!
SCH20183	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Okay	 a quick recap before we really get
into higher-order equations.
SCH20184	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Equations let you solve the most complex
problems if you get the fundamentals down.
SCH20185	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Whoever came up with algebra is just amazing.
They put together a whole method of thinking!
SCH20186	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	They must have really been into this way
of thinking though...
SCH20187	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Just kidding... How about a question instead
of my bad jokes!
SCH20188	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Okay	 {NAME1}-kun. Pop quiz for you
to get everyone's brains going again.
SCH20189	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Diophantus is known as the father of algebra.
What special item did he place a mathematical
problem on?
SCH20191	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Nice try	 but the answer is his tombstone.
That's okay you didn't know. It's just a bit
of trivia.
SCH20192	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Ah	 you're a sharp one. That's right	
his tombstone.
SCH20193	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Diophantus's epitaph contains a word problem
that tells you how old he was when he died.
SCH20194	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Look it up if you're interested. It's not
very hard to solve	 either.
SCH20195	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	But this is quite the tangent from your
textbooks. Let's get back to solving
equations.
SCH20196	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A problem inscribed on one's tombstone
to be solved with one's own methods...
How modish.
SCH20197	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I would inscribe a riddle involving desire
on mine. Doesn't that sound bold?
SCH20198	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...Hoom	 why the sour look?
SCH20199	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	The quiz will cover pages 220 to 284...
Which are on amicable numbers. How fun!
SCH20200	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Oh	 I guess I should explain.
SCH20201	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	That refers to a pair of numbers whose
divisors can be summed up to the other
number.
SCH20202	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Natural numbers with unique properties like
this sometimes get their own name.
SCH20203	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	There are a few others... But let's see if
any of you know them! How about you	
{NAME1}-kun?
SCH20204	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	What's another kind of natural number
discovered to have unique properties?
SCH20206	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Ooh	 not quite... Well	 when there's so many
terms	 it can get tricky to remember which
one's which.
SCH20207	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Another famous one would be perfect numbers.
SCH20208	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	When their divisors are summed up	 the total equals the perfect number.
SCH20209	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Perfect! As in perfect numbers.
SCH20210	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	When their divisors are summed up	 the total equals the perfect number.
SCH20211	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	28	 for example. 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 equals...?
SCH20212	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	28! Its divisors sum up to 28.
SCH20213	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Perfect numbers were even thought to be mystical...
SCH20214	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	...linked to the moon's 28-day orbit of Earth.
SCH20215	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	I know they're just numbers	 but c'mon	
that's pretty neat	 right? It's another reason
why I love math.
SCH20216	Ms. Ka<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>ayama	Right	 I was talking about the quiz. Anyway	
let's get back to class.
SCH20217	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perfect numbers... Hoom	 is 6 not one
as well? 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6	 no?
SCH20218	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Finding them seems like it would be such an
elegant pastime. Now then	 what comes after
6 and 28?
SCH30001	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Mr. Hakozaki's the name	 teaching chemistry is my game!
SCH30002	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	We'll have a gas‚Äînoble	 inert	 you name it!
SCH30004	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...Boy	 tough crowd.
SCH30005	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	It's always rough with these first few classes...
SCH30006	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Oh right	 still mid-introduction. Ahem.
SCH30027	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I'm a fan of natural sciences above all else. Ecosystems are where it's at!
SCH30007	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	My favorite scientist is Henry Cavendish!
SCH30028	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	He's known for discovering hydrogen	 but that's not all he did!
SCH30008	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Ah	 perhaps I ought to open up the floor?
Let's see here...
SCH30009	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I choose you	 {PLAYER_NAME}-san!
SCH30010	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Henry Cavendish may be an excellent scientist
but what was the one thing he never did?
SCH30012	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Oh	 I guess you could interpret that multiple ways	 huh?
SCH30013	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Still	 uh... socializing was the answer I was looking for.
SCH30014	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Yes	 that's exactly it! Guess I'm not
the only Cavendish connoisseur.
SCH30015	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Henry Cavendish was famously antisocial.
SCH30029	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	He never spoke of his important breakthroughs.
SCH30016	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Ohm's law	 Charles's law	
even Coulomb's law...
SCH30030	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	We know now that all of these and more had
been initially discovered by Cavendish.
SCH30017	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Makes you wonder why he published his
findings on hydrogen in the first place	 huh?
SCH30018	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Cavendish was a big inspiration for me.
SCH30019	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	He taught me that you don't need pals to study.
SCH30020	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	However	 university taught me that it's different nowadays.
SCH30021	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	People are part of this world and I'm a big fan of them!
SCH30022	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I think all this science talk calmed my nerves.
SCH30023	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Here's to a year of scientific curiosity!
SCH30024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Keeping major discoveries to oneself...
SCH30025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I would have loved to have gotten a firsthand look at such desire myself.
SCH30026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A desire to satisfy him and him alone.
Hoohoo	 magnificent	 is it not?
SCH30040	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Another day	 another chance to enjoy science!
SCH30041	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Today we're discussing the nature of sound.
SCH30042	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Waves vibrate through air particles	 which
vibrate your eardrums and register as sound.
SCH30043	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	This ability to detect fine vibrations is what makes the ear so special.
SCH30044	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Curious	 isn't it?
SCH30045	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Say	 that reminds me of a hoot of a question!
Anyone know what's special about owl ears?
SCH30046	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Right	 let's see what {PLAYER_NAME}-san
has to say! Go on	 don't be shy	 now.
SCH30047	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	What's so special about owl earholess that
helps them with hunting?
SCH30049	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Uh-huh	 I can see you've thought this through.
SCH30050	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	But we're talking about hunting here	 so...
SCH30051	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Their earholes are positioned unevenly!
Think back to what we said about vibrations.
SCH30052	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Right on the money! Amazing! You really
thought this through	 didn't you?
SCH30053	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Their ears can determine a sound's source
through horizontal discrepancies and height
through vertical discrepancies.
SCH30054	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH30055	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Since they're nocturnal hunters	 they can use
both sight and sound to determine differences
in elevation.
SCH30056	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Their forward-facing ears restrict range...
SCH30057	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Heheh	 the logic of the animal kingdom is
something else. Still	 it gets a bit spooky
from time to time.
SCH30058	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Like	 did you know you can see the back of an
owl's eyeball through their ear hole? Freaky!
SCH30059	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	...Hey	 {PLAYER_NAME}. Take a look.
I want to see if my body's the same way.
SCH30060	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Wait	 one should confirm one's own mysteries
for oneself! Though	 I never thought I'd be
the subject of my own research.
SCH30061	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	but they can whip their heads around no problem to compensate!
SCH30065	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Yikes	 I got chewed out at the staff meeting.
I'm a sad specimen of a science scholar.
SCH30066	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	They say I'm thick as a brick. But there's a lot to take in in social situations!
SCH30067	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Each individual's varying emotions	 complicated rules of etiquette... It's difficult!
SCH30068	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	There was this local female celebrity	 you
know	 Mochizuki Chiyome. She was a head
shrine maiden that traveled the country.
SCH30069	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	But rumor has it she was a kunoichi all along.
SCH30070	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	She convinced women all over Japan to gather intel for her.
SCH30071	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Women can be quite persuasive	 you see.
SCH30072	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I could learn a thing or two from them...
SCH30073	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	But hey	 we've got the internet in the modern age	 right?
SCH30074	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	{PLAYER_NAME}-san	 I saw you first	so join me
for a little thought experiment.
SCH30075	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Fiber-optic cables may connect us with people
around the globe	 but do you have any idea
how that was done?
SCH30077	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Yes	 that's exactly it. The sea's always been
a major obstacle when connecting the world.
SCH30078	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Well	 it'd be interesting if that was true	
but it'd be pretty difficult	 don't you
think?
SCH30079	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	They ran the cables along the sea floor.
SCH30080	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Even though we're all connected thanks to
them	 those connections are only as good
as the people who use the internet.
SCH30081	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I'd love to be a ninja or something. Wouldn't
it be so cool to blend into the shadows...?
SCH30082	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Whoops. There I go	 babbling again. Sorry	
let's jump into the textbooks	 shall we?
SCH30083	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Goodness	 how exhausting.
SCH30084	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Not exactly a topic to explore with your students	 now was that?
SCH30085	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Still	 it is very human of him to be pushed
so off-topic by unrelated factors.
SCH30086	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Fiber-optic cables keep the whole world connected!
SCH30090	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	That's the gist of next class's experiment.
SCH30091	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Be careful	 we'll be handling dangerous chemicals!
SCH30092	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Everyone's safety is key...
SCH30093	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...so any potential pranksters will get a serious tongue-lashing!
SCH30094	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Daily life can be just as dangerous	
of course. Make sure you always
watch where you're going.
SCH30095	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH30096	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	For example	 water's pretty dangerous. People drown in rivers and oceans all the time.
SCH30097	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Save the horseplay for dry land!
SCH30098	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	And that's not even the worst thing about
water.{PLAYER_NAME}-san	 you take
this one.
SCH30099	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Do you know what happens if you drink too
much water? Think worst-case scenario	 here.
SCH30101	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I said worst-case scenario	 didn't I?
SCH30102	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I envy you	 if that's the worst you could
think of.
SCH30103	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Sorry to burst your bubble here	
{PLAYER_NAME}	 but it'll send
you to an early grave.
SCH30104	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Good	 I see you know your stuff.
SCH30105	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	What's a worse scenario than that	 am I right?
SCH30106	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I'm happy you've thought this through. Yes	
you could literally head to an early grave.
SCH30107	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Have you ever heard of water intoxication?
Our bodies need it	 but too much
is dangerous for you.

SCH30109	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	A liter or two won't take you out	 of course!
You'd need more like... fourteen liters.
SCH30110	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	It's not exactly a volume you can sip by
accident	 but still. Something to keep
in the back of your mind.
SCH30111	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Too much of a good thing is bad for you.
Be sure to do everything in moderation	 okay?
SCH30112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Too little of something and your body can't
survive. Too much	 and it crumbles from
the strain.
SCH30113	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A parable for desire	 if I've ever heard one.
We would do well to keep our own desires
in check.
SCH30114	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Promise me that!
SCH30120	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Thanks for turning in your reports!
SCH30121	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	And those of you who failed the experiment	 keep your chins up!
SCH30122	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I saw more examples that made me question how
they failed. That's a sure sign of progress!
SCH30123	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Make assumptions and hypotheses based
on observations	 verify them through
experimentation...
SCH30124	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...and evaluate the results. That's the
scientific method!
SCH30125	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	It's also how humanity arrives at new discoveries.
SCH30126	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Take Ignaz Semmelweis for example	
an incredible eighteenth-century doctor!
SCH30127	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	He discovered the cause of a large
discrepancy in mortality rates between
two hospital wards.
SCH30128	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	And now that knowledge has pretty much
become common sense. All right	
{PLAYER_NAME}-san. I choose you!
SCH30129	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	What was Semmelweis's countermeasure that
reduced patient mortality rates and is now
common practice?
SCH30131	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Hmm	 unfortunately not. The answer was
washing hands and general disinfecting.
SCH30132	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Bit of a curveball	 huh? Don't sweat it.
It threw me for a loop the first time
I heard it too.
SCH30133	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Well	 I've got to hand it to you there!
That's right	 hand-washing and disinfectant.
SCH30134	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Back then	 through trying to maintain a
balanced temperature or bodily fluids to prevent
illness	 he discovered what we know as disinfecting!
SCH30135	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH30136	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Now is that a cutting-edge discovery or what!
Too much so	 actually‚Äîno one believed him.
SCH30137	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Ignaz Semmelweis came up with the method	 but
couldn't prove disinfectant was effective.
SCH30138	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Without his great discovery recognized	 he
succumed to a mental breakdown	 eventually
dying of a bacterial infection...
SCH30139	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I identify with the guy	 really	 I do. Some
things are right	 even if you can't prove it.
SCH30140	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Having that which you desire rejected	 hoom?
A scenario that gives much food for thought	
to be sure.
SCH30141	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How would that man feel to see a world where

SCH30150	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Right	 so the earth makes a full revolution
around the sun once per day	 yes?
SCH30151	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Everybody knows this now	 but presenting the
theory was no walk in the park at first.

SCH30153	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Before that	 everyone thought things revolved
around Earth... ...so I guess you could say
they had their world turned upside down!
SCH30154	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	This topic is fit for both world history
and science. Now	 riddle me this	
{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
SCH30155	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Heliocentric theory is a massive problem
for a certain field of study. Care to guess
which?
SCH30157	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Hmm	 that's outside of my field of expertise	
but I don't think it'd cause a big problem
there.
SCH30158	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I was looking for "religion." Religion held
great authority in old Western
culture.
SCH30159	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH30160	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Exactly	 religion. This put a big damper on
religion's sway over Western culture!
SCH30161	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Back then	 it was just accepted as fact that
we were at the center of the universe.
SCH30162	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	The idea of everything revolving around the
sun was a hard pill for many to swallow.
SCH30163	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Still	 what you believe and what is true
isn't always the same thing.
SCH30164	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I hope all of you will come to assess things
with your own eyes	 not just fall back on
bias.
SCH30165	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	It's important to fit in with your peers	 but
I think the pursuit of truth is way cooler!
SCH30166	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	What you believe isn't the same as what is
true... Poignant words worth remembering.
SCH30167	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	One must always pursue the truth that lies
ahead	 not ingratiate oneself to one's peers.
SCH30180	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	So	 we believe the survival of the fittest
idea explains how life changes form and
nature.
SCH30181	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Various theories continue to be tested...
SCH30182	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Heck	 some even posit it's more of a "survival of the luckiest."
SCH30183	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	I'd argue	 however	 that organs which are
actually unnecessary tend to degenerate	 and
the environment plays a major factor.
SCH30184	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	You've heard about deep-sea fish	 right?

turning. All right	 I'll ask you	
{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
SCH30188	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Which part of the human body could possibly
degenerate and	 eventually	 disappear?
SCH30190	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Sorry	 but you kind of still need those.
The answer is our pinky toes!
SCH30191	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Cooorrect! The answer is our pinky toes.
SCH30192	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Don't you feel like you don't use yours much?
SCH30193	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Humans kick off of their big toe to walk	
putting almost no weight on their pinky toe.
SCH30194	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Losing toes is not all that rare in the
animal kingdom. After all	 horses have
single hoofs	 don't they?
SCH30195	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	That's the result of an evolved middle toe.
A shape adapted to a life of sprinting.
SCH30196	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Humans could shed toes to speed up	 too.
SCH30197	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Ho ho	 now wouldn't that be a funny future to look forward to!
SCH30198	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 the human form still has room for
improvement	 from the sound of it!
SCH30199	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If desire alters the shape of a species	 who
knows what form future humans might take.
SCH30210	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...This means that when minerals are
classified	 they are done so based on
whether or not they have color.
SCH30211	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	What's another property we might use to
classify minerals? Hardness. The Mohs scale
is the most well-known measure for this.
SCH30212	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	They're rated on a scale from one to ten
for their scratch resistance. It's a useful
scale to reference when excavating ore.
SCH30213	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Ooh	 I know! Let's bring this topic a bit
closer to home. {PLAYER_NAME}-san	
you take this one.
SCH30214	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Which part of the human body is harder than
iron and registers seven on the Mohs scale?
SCH30216	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Ding ding ding	 correctamundo! It's the
enamel on your teeth.
SCH30217	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Aaand... Bzzt	 wrong! The answer is
the enamel on adult teeth.
SCH30218	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Our bones come in at around four or five
on the scale	 making them about as tough
as iron or glass.
SCH30219	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Though the Mohs scale only denotes resistance
to being scratched	 not breaking.
SCH30220	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Besides	 our teeth take a ton of stress.
We grind them with the same force as our
body weight!
SCH30221	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	One of my friends chipped a tooth
on chocolate cake once...
His teeth were in bad shape.

SCH30224	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...I've gone on a bit of a tangent. Let's get back to the lesson.
SCH30225	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hard to scratch doesn't mean hard to break...
Sounds like the human spirit	 if you ask me.
SCH30226	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anyone can suffer unexpected heartbreak.
Those who study desire should bear this
in mind.
SCH30240	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	That should cover plant classification.
Wait until we get to animals	 though.
They're way more complicated!
SCH30241	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	People use mnemonics to remember this stuff	
but rote memorization's so boring	 if you
ask me.
SCH30242	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Still	 organized knowledge is good for
helping you recollect things in an instant.
SCH30243	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	When we come across a new species...
SCH30244	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...that shared knowledge provides us the
confidence to identify them in an instant!
SCH30245	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	The names of new species sure are funny. You
get a sense of its discoverer's personality.
SCH30246	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	There's one name I really love.
Let's see if you know anything about it	
{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
SCH30247	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	True or false: the name of the spicy
component in ginger is called shogaol.
SCH30249	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Right you are! It's derived from the Japanese
word for ginger. Isn't that cool?
SCH30250	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Heheh	 I can see that confused you a bit	 but
it's true. That's the name of that component.
SCH30251	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	There's also sanshool	 the spicy component
of the Japanese "sansho" pepper.
SCH30252	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Then there's nattokinase	 the catabolic
enzyme found in natto	 fermented beans.
SCH30253	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	There's even a type of crustacean named
after an anime character!
SCH30254	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Pretty fun	 right!? Science is a human
creation	 but it's stuff like that that makes
it feel even more human.
SCH30255	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Desire that can be gleaned from names	 is it?
What a refreshing way to look at them!
SCH30256	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... Makes me wonder what sort of desire
one can derive from your name.
SCH30270	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	And that's it for chemical reactions. They're
pretty complicated stuff	 so make sure you
take notes on this	 class.
SCH30271	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	People say we only consult them
during experiments...
SCH30272	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	...but that couldn't be further from
the truth.
SCH30273	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	You see them all the time in our daily lives.
For example: disposable hand warmers!
SCH30274	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Iron reacts with oxygen in the air and turns
to iron oxide	 generating heat in the
process.
SCH30275	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Knowing this might come in handy whenever
you need to warm up your hands in winter.
SCH30276	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Now that I've got your minds warmed up too...
{PLAYER_NAME}-san	 try answering
this one.
SCH30277	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Say you want to use a hand warmer going to
and from school but pause its reaction while
in class. How would you do so?
SCH30279	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Hmm... Not sure that would cut the mustard.
The answer is sealing it in a bag.
SCH30280	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Exactly! I'm glad you understand. Full marks
for you!
SCH30281	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Those hand warmers use the heat made
from iron oxide reactions	 so in order to
stop said reaction...
SCH30282	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	This will regulate when the iron changes
to iron oxide	 letting you control when
the hand warmer heats up.
SCH30283	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Learning the basics of how things work
lets you use them in new ways like this
SCH30284	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	or even repair and reuse them!
SCH30285	Mr. Ha<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ozaki	Such mechanisms are both fun and useful

SCH40014	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Man	 you kids really are clueless.
SCH40015	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	The answer is war! "The war of all

SCH40032,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,A government enacts laws to control the bad
and protect the good. This means that laws

where the rights you all take for granted did not exist.
SCH40093,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,Take 17th century Europe, for example. Even
though liberal ideas had taken root, there
were still problems with human rights.

SCH40099,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,Tch... You're unexpectedly encyclopedic.
Yes, the answer is Artemisia Gentileschi.
SCH40100,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,Wrong. For starters, the gender doesn't even
match. The correct answer is
Artemisia Gentileschi.
SCH40101,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,Gentileschi was unfairly tried in court and
released a work based on her
own experience...
SCH40102,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,Her works were powerful and appealed to
public opinion, and she gradually gained
mass recognition for her artistic skill.
SCH40103,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,It's not as though her works completely
eliminated discrimination of course, but they
may have given courage to many women.
SCH40104,Mr. Shimon<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>ma,Indirect actions of great figures like
Gentileschi empowered everyday people to push

SCH40152	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Fukuzawa actually goes on to say distinctions do exist...
SCH40153	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	And to overcome these inequalities	
we must educate ourselves. Under
capitalism	 the educated will profit.
SCH40154	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Learn practical skills and how to make
money. That's the gist of it.

SCH40164	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Now	 on to the next section. You'd all better

SCH40165	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So learning how to profit monetarily

SCH40180	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	The philosopher Diogenes the Cynic famously

The answer is exercise to train the body

SCH40191	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Tch	 how the heck did you know that? Yes	
it was exercise to train the body and mind.
SCH40192	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	A healthy mind will dwell in a healthy body.
Or at least that's the general idea.
SCH40193	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	But your generation so loves to categorize
things based on their superficial

SCH40217	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Oh	 are we a contrarian now? Annoyingly
enough	 you're correct.
SCH40218	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Hah	 not a thought in your head today	 huh?
As a matter of fact	 it is possible.
SCH40219	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	A desert is defined as an area with extremely
low rainfall covered in sand or stone.
SCH40220	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	But in many cases when it rains in the
desert	 a year's worth of rain falls
in a single day.
SCH40221	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	What happens then when all that rain drains
through the sand without plants to absorb it?
SCH40222	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	It all rushes straight across the land	
creating a flash flood.
SCH40223	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	This world is full of things you think aren't
possible‚Äîand not just out in the desert!
SCH40224	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	So always be prepared for the impossible	
kids. Because like it or not	 you WILL be

SCH40225	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Attitude aside	 his advice is sound.
We can never be truly certain what the

SCH40240	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	In modern Japan we use cash currency	
which is issued by the state and the
national bank.
SCH40241	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	As every middle schooler knows	 the
Bank of Japan prints banknotes...
SCH40242	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	...and the government mints coins.
SCH40243	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Naturally	 there are costs to producing cash.
Some denominations are even made at a loss...
SCH40244	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	All right	 {PLAYER_NAME}! Are you even
listening? Let's put that to the test.
SCH40245	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Which denomination of yen does the
government take a loss to produce?
SCH40247	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Tch	 you're right. It's obvious enough when
you consider which has the least cash value.
SCH40248	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Wrong! Did you even try to use your brain?
The correct answer is the one-yen coin.
SCH40249	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	It varies based on the going rate for metals	
but making a one-yen coin costs roughly
three yen.
SCH40250	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	So the Mint loses two yen for every one-yen
coin it makes. Other coins make up for it	
though.
SCH40251	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Places like the EU have proposed eliminating
small denomination coins to avoid these
costs.
SCH40252	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Electronic payment systems could perhaps
solve this problem too	 but that requires
legislation.
SCH40253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So the currency you usually use might just
disappear? I suppose you'd get used to it
once it's gone...
SCH40254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So many humans don't even care about
their own desires; what's a coin or two to
them?
SCH40270	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Are you kids familiar with the civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr?
SCH40271	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Does MLK ring a bell	 perhaps? He's the
man who gave the famous "I Have a Dream"
speech.
SCH40272	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964
for his contributions to the nonviolent
struggle against racial discrimination.

achieve his goals.
SCH40274	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	So Mrs. King took over his cause and founded
a center for nonviolent social change
in his name.

discrimination	 won two Nobel Prizes?
SCH40278	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Tch	 didn't fall for it	 huh? Yes	
the correct answer is Mrs. Marie Curie.
SCH40279	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	Hah	 thank you for proving that you weren't

Mrs. Marie Curie.
SCH40280	Mr. Shimon<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>ma	She received her first prize jointly with her

SCH50015	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Through armed interventions in the Caribbean

SCH50034	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But I feel the main one was that the public
hated him. It's very important that you

you hear often	 is it?
SCH50042	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	This thief broke the law and stole property	
and yet	 the public still loved him...
SCH50043	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's because he stole
from the oppressive rich...
SCH50044	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	...and shared his ill-gotten gains
with the public and other
influential people in town.
SCH50045	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Robespierre also fought against inequality	
but all he gave the people was fear.
SCH50046	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's why everyone resented him so much.
Will you be liked or hated? It's tough
to say.
SCH50047	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So	 the difference between them all
boiled down to public reception. I'm not sure
if I agree with that or not.
SCH50048	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They each followed the path of their desires
to the very end. But those decisions to do so
were theirs alone to make.
SCH50060	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	All right	 class... Today we'll be heading
to ancient Rome. There's a famous
expression about Rome.
SCH50061	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It goes "all roads lead to Rome." It refers
to the road network in and around the area.
SCH50062	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But these roads don't just lead to Rome.
They extended all the way to France	 England	
and even Africa.
SCH50063	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Measures were taken to make transit on them
easier. However	 these roads were more than
mere connections.
SCH50064	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Let's see... Based on today's high
and your student numbers...
SCH50065	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
SCH50066	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	What material was not used for Roman roads?
Here's a hint... It doesn't last long.
SCH50068	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's right. They never used wood.
The reason is because it rots quickly.
SCH50069	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Yes	 you'd be inclined to think that.
I understand exactly where you're
coming from.
SCH50070	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But I'm afraid that's not right. They never
used wood. The reason is because it
rots quickly.
SCH50071	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	They increased the roads' stability by using
four layers of cement and stones
of various sizes.
SCH50072	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50073	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	To prevent flooding	 the center was elevated
and drainage ditches were added to
both sides.
SCH50074	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50075	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That these roads are still in use after 2000
years is a testament to their durability.
SCH50076	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50077	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The Roman Empire knew how important
infrastructure was to controlling
their expansive territory.
SCH50078	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom! So	 they really used cement back then?
They were as sophisticated as people
are today!
SCH50079	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Could the Romans' desires have spurred them
to be so? Desires truly drive people
to improve...
SCH50080	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The characters in my name may give off the
image of valleys and mountains	 but I'm
honestly not one for hiking.
SCH50091	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	All right	 class. We'll be moving onto the
four great civilizations. Today	 we'll be
focusing on Egypt.
SCH50092	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Though we refer to it all as Ancient Egypt...
SCH50093	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	...the areas that flourished in the
civilization changed from era to era.
SCH50094	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Both Upper and Lower Egypt had their own
kingdoms. While there were conflicts	
they gradually became integrated.
SCH50095	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	...But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself mentioning "upper" and "lower."
SCH50096	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Look at the handout I just passed out.
SCH50097	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Civilization was founded along the Nile
River	 and there were kingdoms up and down
the river.
SCH50098	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Based on the number of people I saw this
morning in red... {PLAYER_NAME}-san.
SCH50099	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Which Egypt do you think diagram A shows?
SCH50101	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Hmm	 yes	 it does appear that way.
But	 you're wrong. It's Lower Egypt.
SCH50102	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Instead of looking at the map as top versus
bottom	 it's better to think upstream versus
downstream.
SCH50103	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Lower Egypt is correct. Instead of looking
at the map as top versus bottom...
SCH50104	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	...it's better to think upstream versus
downstream.
SCH50105	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It's easy to get confused since the lower
part is at the top	 but just think of it from
the perspective of someone living there.
SCH50106	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Keep in mind what was most intuitive for them
and you'll never forget. Always make sure to
examine things from the ground up.
SCH50107	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	So	 now that we have a grasp of how Ancient
Egypt was orientated	 we can cover its
politics and culture.
SCH50108	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo! A misconception derived from only looking at things from a map.
SCH50109	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's a definitive example of armchair theory... How riveting.
SCH50120	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	All right	 class. Today we'll be moving onto
Ancient Greece. There's really a lot to learn
about and from this period in history.
SCH50121	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It had a huge impact on Western culture. Much
of it still remains relevant to this day.
SCH50122	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	For instance	 the Pythagorean theorem in
math. It was discovered by the ancient Greek
Pythagoras.
SCH50123	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	There are other examples as well	 but let's see if any of you know some.
SCH50124	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Using today's humidity and your student
numbers	 let's ask... {PLAYER_NAME}-san.
SCH50125	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The word "melancholy" historically referred
to a secretion... Which organ did that
secretion come from?
SCH50127	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Well	 yes	 that is one of the organs
associated most with feelings of
great sadness.
SCH50128	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But you're a bit off the mark. The answer is
the liver. To be precise	 melancholy is the
bile secreted from there.
SCH50129	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's right. It's the liver. To be precise	
melancholy is the bile secreted from there.
SCH50130	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Melancholy was originally used in humorism	
a medical theory claiming unbalanced humors
affect health and temperament.
SCH50131	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50132	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Melancholy is an excess of black bile...
Melan- means "black	
and -choly means bile."
SCH50133	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Sadness can be a precursor to the seven
deadly sins	 so black bile was not looked
upon favorably.
SCH50134	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50135	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Knowing what we know now	 this theory must
sound like a joke	 right?
SCH50136	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But this theory was supported until the birth
of morbid anatomy in the 19th century.
SCH50137	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The basis for what we consider common sense
has	 historically speaking	 only been
discovered relatively recently.
SCH50138	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50139	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... She has a point. Current common
knowledge could easily be shelved by
new discoveries.
SCH50140	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50141	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 what desires would lead to
such discoveries? I'd like to see for
myself someday.
SCH50150	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	So	 Emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have
built the original Great Wall to protect
the people against invaders...
SCH50151	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	His wall was repaired and relocated during
several later dynasties before it took shape
as the Great Wall as we know it today.
SCH50152	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Most of the surviving sections are from
the Ming Dynasty and located further south
than in the Qin Dynasty.
SCH50153	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	In Chinese	 the Great Wall is known as "the
10	000 li-long wall." Does anyone know how
long this world heritage site really is?
SCH50154	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Oh	 would you look at the time.
{PLAYER_NAME}-san	 it's your
time to shine.
SCH50155	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	A li is also known as the Chinese mile	 but would that make the Great Wall 10	000 miles long?
SCH50157	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	I understand wanting to give a clear-cut
answer. But there isn't one this time.
SCH50158	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Precisely. What is considered one "li" depends on where and when you are in history.
SCH50159	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	In present-day Japan	 one li is about
2.44 miles	 but in Qin China	 one li was
a little over a quarter of a mile.
SCH50160	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Quite the difference	 right? The distance
also changes depending on whether or not
you include the mountains and valleys.
SCH50161	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	In 2012	 the Great Wall was measured at a
length of approximately 13	170 miles... That
equals a whopping 53	000 Chinese li.
SCH50162	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Which means it's not the "10	000 li-long
wall" after all. So	 in short	 there isn't
really a clear-cut answer on this one.
SCH50163	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Heehee! A very tricky question	 indeed.
Don't worry	 though. It won't be on the exam.
SCH50164	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see. Whether it's correct or not depends on
the viewer's outlook and knowledge.
SCH50165	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That was certainly a duplicitous problem	
but I'll let it slide for the knowledge it
provided.
SCH50180	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Today we'll be going over four cradles of
civilization of the so-called "Old World."
Let's start off with the basics.
SCH50181	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Here we have Mesopotamian	 Indus Valley	 Nile
Valley and Yellow River civilizations. Try to
associate them with their topography.
SCH50182	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	There are times when words alone are
enough to figure out where on the map
a civilization was.
SCH50183	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Based on how many corn flakes were in my
cereal this morning... {PLAYER_NAME}-san	
why don't you try to answer?
SCH50184	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Which of the following civilization names
reflects what the area around it looked like?
SCH50186	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's right. Great job. The correct answer
is Mesopotamia.
SCH50187	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Well	 that does have the name of the river in
it	 so as long as you know where that is...
SCH50188	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But that wasn't what I was looking for.
Mesopotamia is the correct answer.
SCH50189	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The other three are named after their
neighboring rivers	 but that's not the case
with Mesopotamia.
SCH50190	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The meso- part means "between" and -potamia means "river."
SCH50191	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Together	 they translate to "the land between two rivers."
SCH50192	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It got that name because it was located
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
SCH50193	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	See	 what did I tell you? Learning a few
words probably made it a bit easier to
remember the other names too	 right?
SCH50194	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	You youngsters are always looking for
shortcuts	 but seemingly irrelevant info
can prove its worth at times.
SCH50195	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	I'll do my best to give you all more hints to
level up your knowledge	 so make sure to pay
attention in class	 okay?
SCH50196	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I see... It's similar to how we phantom
thieves havea knack for finding infiltration
clues from seemingly unrelated things.
SCH50197	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50198	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo... I never realized education and
phantom thievery had so much in common.
SCH50210	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	All right	 class. Today we'll be going over
the Age of Discovery	 a time of great
expansion for European society...
SCH50211	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	...when Columbus arrived in the New World	
Vasco da Gama pioneered a route to India	
and Magellan circumnavigated the globe.
SCH50212	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Spices were the reason Magellan gave when
asked what motivated his reckless journey.
SCH50213	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Based on the number of birds I saw outside on
the telephone lines earlier... why don't you
try to answer	 {PLAYER_NAME}-san?
SCH50214	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Why did spices play a major role in
Magellan's expedition around the world?
SCH50216	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Sure	 it'd be nice if that was true... but
it's completely wrong. Money is the answer.
SCH50217	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's right. Huge profits to be had from
trade were the driving force for sea route
development.
SCH50218	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	When someone tries something new	 we often
say it was to achieve their dream or satisfy
their sense of adventure.
SCH50219	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But the real motivating factor is money.
Nothing can be done without it.
SCH50220	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Money buys you food and housing	 but what do
dreams and adventurous spirit get you?
SCH50221	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It's kind of sad	 but it's the truth.
SCH50222	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It was the same for the explorers in the Age of Discovery.
SCH50223	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They couldn't fill their stomachs with dreams
and adventure. That said	 there are also
things money can't buy.
SCH50224	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Personally	 I'd prefer a desire so strong
that it would give me the means to be
satisfied in both ways.
SCH50240	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	All right	 class... That about does it for the start of the Norman Conquest.
SCH50241	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It was a major event for the UK and France	 so be sure to keep it in your memory banks.
SCH50242	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The relationship between those two countries
goes very deep. We're still affected by it	
even here in Japan after all.
SCH50243	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Let's see	 looking at who's in class today...
{PLAYER_NAME}-san	 why don't you
try to answer?
SCH50244	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	We call the meat of a cow "beef	 but where
does that word come from?
SCH50246,Ms. Tani<#000000,y,#FFFFFF>ama,You'd think so, right? I mean, it is English,
after all. But that's incorrect. It's France.
SCH50247,Ms. Tani<#000000,y,#FFFFFF>ama,That's right. It's France. Beef" actually
comes from French.
SCH50248	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	England and France are only about 21 miles
apart	 so they've shared quite a bit of
language and culture with each other.
SCH50249	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	For reference	 it's about 18 miles from Tokyo
to Yokohama. So two countries really are
neighbors.
SCH50250	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Because European nations are so close to each
other	 there are lots of examples of their
cultures mixing like this.
SCH50251	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Grasping the relationships of the countries
on the map makes it a bit easier to
understand historical events.
SCH50252	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Modern history is all about political
relationships	 so the sooner you learn them	
the easier your future exams will be.
SCH50253	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It does sound strange to say that places as
close as Yokohama and Tokyo speak different
languages.
SCH50254	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But I've also heard distance has no relation
to languages. Hoohoo... Maybe you should take
this occasion to learn another language.
SCH50270	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Okay	 onto our next topic: the travels of
the adventurer Marco Polo.
SCH50271	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	He was also known for elaborately
calling the little islands of Japan
Zipangu, the Land of Gold.
SCH50272	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	But he never actually visited Japan	 it's
said that he heard the name passed on
incorrectly through word of mouth.

SCH50274	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	It may sound ridiculous	 but this kind of
thing happens all ofthe time.

SCH50276	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Now	 I'm gonna pick one of you at random to answer...
SCH50277	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	{PLAYER_NAME}-san	 it's your lucky day!
SCH50278	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	How did the Canary Islands get their name?
This is another case of a misunderstanding.
SCH50280	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Well	 that would make sense. But I did say
it was a misunderstanding...
SCH50281	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	So	 you're wrong. Its many dogs is
the correct answer.
SCH50282	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	That's right. Great job. There are many
dogs there.
SCH50283	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	The Latin word for dog is "canis."
The islands got their name from that
because of the many wild dogs there.
SCH50284	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	And when a new kind of bird was discovered
there	 it was named "canary" after
the island.
SCH50285	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH50286	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	However	 most of us today believe that
it was because there are a lot of birds
on this island.
SCH50287	Ms. Tani<#000000	y	#FFFFFF>ama	Heheh	 so while we may think we know what
we're talking about	 people in the future
may laugh at us.
SCH50288	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As long as what we are looking for is a bird	
the original meaning doesn't matter.
SCH50289	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It isn't the name that's important	 but the essence.
SCH50290	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's much like a desire in that sense.
SCH60001	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Hello	 I'm Mr. Endou. I have the pleasure of
teaching you English	 an indispensable crutch
if you ever need to flee the country.
SCH60002	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Hm... Was that a little too dramatic?
But it's true. And I would be lying if I said
I didn't want to escape	 too.
SCH60003	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	However	 let us set that aside for the time
being. Learning a foreign language is one of
the best things you can do.
SCH60004	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	While you can talk to a hundred million
people in Japanese	 you could talk to over
a billion in English.
SCH60005	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	That said	 learning it as your second
language puts you at a bit of a disadvantage.
SCH60006	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	You'll have to play catchup with
the native speakers in regard to
pronunciation and vocab.
SCH60007	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	That's why I'm a fan of constructed
languages.
SCH60008	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	They're made by people instead of emerging
naturally	 so it levels the playing field
a bit.
SCH60009	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But of course	 they're not perfect.
SCH60010	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Let's see if you know	 um...
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
SCH60011	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	What's the most widely recognized constructed
language meant to be used as an international
auxiliary language?
SCH60013	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Yes	 Esperanto. You're quite the diligent
student. Around a million people speak it	
apparently.
SCH60014	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I should've known.
SCH60015	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Lofty goals get you nowhere without widespread recognition...
SCH60016	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But I'm afraid the answer is Esperanto.
Around a million people speak it	 and yet...
SCH60017	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	There are reasons it hasn't caught on	 such
as a lack of cultural background...
SCH60018	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But also...
SCH60019	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Everyone has to work equally hard to learn it.
SCH60020	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	With so many people who speak English	 would an English speaker really bother?
SCH60021	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I think it makes sense	 personally.
SCH60022	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	It's really hard work for those of us who have to master a new language.
SCH60023	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But enough about my ideals for an
Esperanto-speaking world. For now	 let's just
try our best to study English this year.
SCH60024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	All of humanity striving to overcome the language barrier...
SCH60025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I think that's a splendid desire to have!
SCH60026	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I would gladly contribute to such a grand ambition.
SCH60027	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Maybe I should look into this Esperanto a bit more...
SCH60040	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	In this case	 this means "Betty was looking
forward to it." The rest of the translation
is up to you.
SCH60041	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But don't think you can just sit and memorize
every idiom. There are way too many to
do that.
SCH60042	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Luckily	 English phrases are composed of
words	 and words always have an etymology
and meaning.
SCH60043	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Learning how to decode those can give
valuable insight when you come across a new word.

SCH60045	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Hm... Okay	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
See if you can get this one.
SCH60046	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Abduct. "Only." "Never." Which word is
derived from a number?
SCH60048	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Sorry	 that's not it.
SCH60049	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Yes	 that's correct.
SCH60050	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	It comes from "one" plus -ly. And of course
it means "one of a kind."
SCH60051	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	The prefix ab- means "away	 which helps
identify its meaning of carring away someone
or something.
SCH60052,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,The ne-" part was an old form of "not."
Hence its meaning of not ever.
SCH60053	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Each part of an English word has meaning.
The same as ideograms or the kanji we use
in Japanese.
SCH60054	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	It's not always that simple	 of course.
SCH60055	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But the more you know	 right?
SCH60056	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	English and Japanese look so different...
SCH60057	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. In other words	 while a foreign custom
may seem nonsensical to us	 it still has its
own purpose and history. How intriguing.
SCH60058	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH60059	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I never thought they'd function in similar ways.
SCH60070	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Many students get hung up on numbers when
reading in English. Let me give you a little
trick to reading them correctly.
SCH60071	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH60072	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	We count numbers one way in Japanese.
For us it makes perfect sense	 and it's what
our brains are used to.
SCH60073	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	So it can be difficult to read big numbers when saying them out loud in a foreign language.
SCH60074	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Let's see you give it a shot	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
SCH60075	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	One "oku" in Japanese is a large amount.
But how much exactly is it?
SCH60077	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I did say it was hard	 to be fair.
But one oku is one hundred million.
SCH60078	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Well	 aren't you good with numbers?
You're right. It's one hundred million.
SCH60079	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Large numbers are especially confusing
because they're split up differently
in Japanese and English.
SCH60080	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	In English	 you can have up to
one hundred "thousands." But in Japanese	
ten thousand is its own unit.
SCH60081	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	English numbers change every three zeros.
These are marked with commas.
SCH60082	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	100	000	000 is one hundred million...
SCH60083	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	...because 100 comes before the first comma.
SCH60084	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Makes sense	 since writing numerals like this
was invented in the English-speaking world.
SCH60085	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Might not help much on your exam	 but keep
it in mind for the future anyway.
SCH60086	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH60087	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So many unique ways of counting... Human
inventions like these are truly impressive.
SCH60088	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It could be interesting to think about what
desires caused these divergences.
SCH60100	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I won't name names...
SCH60101	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	...but I had one student who really made me
happy to be a teacher.
SCH60102	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	They had the most sincere look on their face	
but then told me	 "You're such a busybody!"
SCH60103	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I think they meant I work hard to help them.
Finding the right words in a second language
can be hard...
SCH60104	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Differences in nuance like this exist in
every language	 including both English
and Japanese.
SCH60105	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Take "fate" and "destiny	 for example.
SCH60106,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,They are similar, but slightly different.
SCH60107,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,Right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun?
Let's test your sense for nuance.
SCH60108,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,Compared to destiny	 is fate" more
positive or negative of a word?
SCH60110	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I'm afraid you're wrong. "Fate" is actually
more negative.
SCH60111	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Nice intuition. You have a knack for this I see!
SCH60112	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	It comes from the Latin for "thing spoken by
the gods." It's used to mean an inescapable
result‚Äîmuch like death.
SCH60113	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	A god's word cannot be changed	 no matter
what. That's what makes it negative.
SCH60114	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Destiny stems from a word meaning
make firm. Thus	 it carries an air
of decisiveness.
SCH60115	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But through willpower	 you can intervene
and change things	 so "destiny" is used to
refer to the unknown.
SCH60116	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Word choice is critical in every language.
SCH60117	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	There are plenty of words with similar meanings but different nuances.
SCH60118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I can think of quite a few of them	
but how about you all...?
SCH60119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But wait	 what about words that also have the same nuance...?
SCH60120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	How are "flammable" and "inflammable" different?
SCH60121	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	As you said	 it's often used in a bad sense.
SCH60122	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	That's why today we'll be focusing on boosting your vocabulary.
SCH60130	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I'm handing back your pop quiz results today.
There were... quite a few spelling mistakes.
SCH60131	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Don't worry	 learning English spelling was
hard for me	 as well. Like	 what's that first
d in "Wednesday" doing there anyway?
SCH60132	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Speaking of which	 there are some interesting
differences between English and Japanese.
SCH60133	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Word order	 how the sentence subject works...
Every little thing seems different.
And yet...
SCH60134	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	The days of the week have the same origins.
SCH60135	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Let me ask you something	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
SCH60136	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Where do both English and Japanese get their
names for the days of the week from?
SCH60138	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Yes	 it's astronomy. Thanks for answering
correctly.
SCH60139	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Well	 you tried	 and that's what counts.
The answer is actually astronomy.
SCH60140	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	The names of the days refer to the distance
to other planets in our solar system.
SCH60141	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Monday	 "Moon Day." Saturday	 "Saturn Day."
Sunday is of course "Sun Day."
SCH60142	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Don't tell me	 "But the moon's not a planet!"
SCH60143	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Whether in Asia or Europe	 it was the same.
Everyone looked to the sky to measure time.

SCH60150	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	It isn't	 but it is what people perceived back then.

SCH60160	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Let's translate the part about Ken
joining the football club. It's a popular
extracurricular activity in America.
SCH60161	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I'd go so far as to say it's culturally important there	 as people even play it casually.
SCH60162	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	What would be a casual sport in Japan...? Dodgeball?
SCH60163	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	When dodgeball was imported to Japan	
the original name apparently scared people.
SCH60164	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	You can dodge a ball	 but you can't dodge
a quiz from me. Let's go with... you	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
SCH60165	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	What was dodgeball originally called?
Remember	 it sounded frightening.
SCH60167	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Hmm	 perhaps I could have given you a better
hint... I'm afraid the answer was "Deadball."
SCH60168	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Ding	 ding	 ding! The good ol' ball of death!
I can see why people were scared.
SCH60169	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	The name changed after the rules were altered
to allow players to catch the ball.
SCH60170	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Dodge helps explain the rules...
SCH60171	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	...but "dead" just leaves you scratching
your head.
SCH60172	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I love to think about that	 personally. With
a suitable name it spread far and wide!

No	 wait a minute. I can't ignore this.
SCH60191	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Or "that's a dangerous threat." It's like

SCH60193	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	It's technically redundant and incorrect.

Help me out with this mess.
SCH60195	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	What troubles me is the word "uniform."
Form means shape	 but what is uni-?
SCH60197	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	You're correct. It means "one" as in
single.
SCH60198	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I can see why you guessed that	 but
unfortunately	 it means "one."
SCH60199	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Uniform literally means something that
has one form. So of course they match!
No need to say so.
SCH60200	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	No one likes the grammar police	 though.
SCH60201	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But I can't help it. I'm a teacher!
SCH60202	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Paying attention to details like that isn't
bad. But it sounds a bit snobby when you
point it out.
SCH60203	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	So try not to be a smart aleck	 okay?
Because you probably make just as many
mistakes without realizing.
SCH60204	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	As your English teacher	 I'm one to know.
Now	 back to class.
SCH60205	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Error: tkabnt-KB
SCH60206	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Awareness alone doesn't fix mistakes...
SCH60207	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Perhaps one's many desires of who they want to become are to blame.
SCH60208	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hold your desires close	 {PLAYER_NAME}	
or you'll end up like that.
SCH60220	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	The -ing makes it function like an adjective
here. This is called the present participle.
SCH60221	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Speaking of -ing... I got curious and looked
into the word "wedding" recently.
SCH60222	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	You'll hear it in nouns like "wedding dress"
all the time	 but it's almost never used as a
verb	 like "I'm wedding my wife today."
SCH60223	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Instead	 we use the verb "marry." Like in
the clich√© phrase used during a proposal.
SCH60224	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	So	 I looked up the etymology of "wed"
and found it's because it was originally
only used in limited situations.
SCH60225	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Let's see if you can figure out which ones.
Listen up	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun	
and make a guess.
SCH60226	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	What was the original meaning of "wed"?
Keep in mind	 it's not related to marriage.
SCH60228	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	How isn't that related to marriage?
As your teacher	 I'm concerned about
your listening skills.
SCH60229	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	We can discuss that later	 but for now...
the correct answer is "gamble."
SCH60230	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Ah	 very sharp. You must be an experienced
gambler to make that connection.
SCH60231	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But enough jokes. Congrats! You're right!
SCH60232	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Wed is derived from a word meaning "wager	
and supposedly referred to the money to be
spent on a bride.
SCH60233,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,I don't know if it's true, but I'd buy it.
Some people do call marriage a gamble,
after all.
SCH60234,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,Or maybe that's a little too cynical...
Let's just say it depends on the person.
SCH60235,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,In my opinion, marriage isn't the only
gamble. Life, for example, is all about
taking risks.
SCH60236,L<#000000,u,#FFFFFF>fel,People sacrifice themselves for the desires
they believe in, not knowing what awaits
them.
SCH60250,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,Johnny's grandmother made the best potato
pie	 is how I'd translate this part.
SCH60251,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,...This textbook is quite odd, isn't it?
SCH60252,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,In America, apple or cherry pie is much more
common, but potato?
SCH60253,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,Nothing beats a nice, baked potato, though.
All it needs is a little butter. So simple
and delicious!
SCH60254,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,But sometimes phrases mean more than
just their words. I'm talking about idiomatic
expressions and slang.
SCH60255,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,All right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
I know you can get this one,
just don't be a potatohead.
SCH60256,Mr. E<#000000,n,#FFFFFF>do,What does phrase hot potato" refer to?
Think about the game you'd play when you
were younger.
SCH60258	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	That's an interesting way to look at the phrase...
SCH60259	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But	 no	 the answer is "a task no one wants to do."
SCH60260	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Aha	 correct! You must do a lot of cooking!
It's a task no one wants to do.
SCH60261	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Imagine a piping hot potato.
SCH60262	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	No one would want to touch it. It hurts!
SCH60263	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	You can't even peel it without burning
yourself. That's why it's a task no one
wants to touch.
SCH60264	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Idioms like that can seem kind of random...
SCH60265	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	...but there's always a backstory to it. That's why I love them!
SCH60266	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	This phrase probably won't pop up on your
entrance exams	 but you can use it to impress
native speakers.
SCH60267	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Imagining a task you want to pass onto
someone else as throwing them a piping
hot potato...
SCH60268	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoohoo	 it brings to mind a rather amusing
scenario... Perhaps you should try it on
the Phantom Thieves!
SCH60280	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	The scores on the listening test were
fantastic. Everyone did great! I'm very proud
of you all.
SCH60281	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Listening skills lead to speaking skills	
so keep it up and get those ears used
to hearing English!
SCH60282	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Knowing the rules of pronunciation also
helps. Sometimes the sounds don't match
the letters.
SCH60283	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Let it go might be slurred together when

Give this question a try.
SCH60285	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	What is it called when the sounds of
two words are blended together?
SCH60287	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Right	 because the words are linked together.
SCH60288	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Hah	 nice try. The real answer is linking.
Sometimes the simplest answer is correct.
SCH60289	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	That said	 there are still rules when it
comes to merging and dropping sounds.
It's not just random.
SCH60290	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	But just knowing that a rule exists can make
listening a lot easier.
SCH60291	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	I didn't learn this until college	 actually.
SCH60292	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	And when I did	 I wished I'd been taught it sooner!
SCH60293	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Don't waste all that time struggling
like I had to in my youth.
SCH60294	Mr. E<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>do	Listen to your elders at least this once.
SCH60295	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I thought textbooks contained all the rules
and answers	 but I suppose they can't cover
it all.
SCH60296	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It feels a bit metaphorical for all of

about that Pixie seem strange to you?
ZD900112	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I overheard the Shadows talking just now.
That must be the <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> they mentioned.
ZD900124	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Anything could happen. Be on your guard.
ZD900113	B<#000000	l	#FFFFFF>ack Ooze (Ailment)	Nice try. That won't work on a <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>
like me.
ZD900114	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	So that's what a <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> is... There's no
need to panic though.
ZD900115	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You should have just gotten a <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>
capable of dealing with this <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>.
ZD900116	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If what the Shadows were saying is correct	
it should be able to wipe out the <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>.
ZD900117	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	To use it	 you'll need to use the
<color=#FF423F>Combat Chip</color>.
ZD900118	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Each turn	 the <color=#FF423F>Combat Chip</color> will
accumulate <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>.
ZD900119	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You'll need 20 Deployment Points to issue
attack commands to the <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>.
ZD900125	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Learning by doing is the best approach.
For now	 follow my lead.
ZD900120	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	First	 quickly accumulate <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>	
then attack the <color=#FF423F>Pixie</color>.
ZD900121	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Looks like you have some <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>	
but you'll need more. Go again	 Wonder.
ZD900122	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You appear to have enough <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>
now. Attack with the <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>!
ZD900123	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> went away	 just like we planned.
Let's finish it off while we still can.
ZD900211	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> again	 and with the same
approach? How uninspired.
ZD900212	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It appears I spoke too soon. This one is some
sort of Glitch amalgamation.
ZD900213	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	No matter. They're all the same.
The <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color> shall take care of it.
ZD900311	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... It appears our attacks are having
a harder time connecting.
ZD900312	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Worry not. There is a way forward.
ZD900313	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	By using the <color=#FF423F>Self-Destruct Bots</color>	 you can
break through its defense.
ZD900314	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The Self-Destruct Bots function just like
Combat Drones. First	 focus on collecting
Deployment Points.
ZD900315	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Once you have enough points	 issue
your command.
ZD900316	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The more Self-Destruct Bots you employ	 the
greater the damage.
ZD219011	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	This doesn't bode well... That last move
<color=#FF423F>muddled</color> our allies.
ZD219012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	As soon as possible	 use an item or skill
that has a <color=#FF423F>status recovery</color> effect.
ZD219013	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	It's about to target someone!
Prepare to cover them!
ZD219014	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	Damn! That jerk is just gonna retreat into
the screen again!? Can't we do anything?
ZD219015	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	That <color=#FF423F>projector</color> is suspicious.
There must be trick to it.
ZD219016	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Target those first! Once they're gone	
we can <color=#FF423F>limit Miyazawa's movement</color>.
ZD219017	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Our allies have become Forgetful! Quickly	
have <color=#FF423F>Marian</color> use her <color=#FF423F>Healing Grace</color>
to help them!
ZD262411	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The enemy has locked on to us.
Have <color=#FF423F>Fox</color> use his<color=#FF423F>Keen Eye</color> to
defend against the attack.
ZD913501	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	I won't let you have my <color=#FF423F>money</color>! No one
can have it... No one!
ZD913502	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	He summoned a guard... Looks like he's
serious about protecting that <color=#FF423F>money</color>.
ZD913504	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You might be onto something. If only we could
find a way to steal it...
ZD913505	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	What's up with this guy? He's super tough!
ZD913506	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom... Perhaps it has something to do with
the guards he summoned.
ZD913507	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	That does seem likely. Let's try taking
out the guards!
ZD913508	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Understood!
ZD913509	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Huh? Did it drop something? Wait	 is that
the <color=#FF423F>money</color> he was talking about?
ZD913510	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Whoa	 for real!? If we take out more	 we'll
be rich!
ZD913511	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Settle down	 Skull. That's not real money.
ZD913513	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Of course. Figures it'd be something
like that!
ZD913514	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	However	 I can sense some sort of power from
that imitation money... It might be
advantageous to collect it after all.
ZD913515	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Okay! Then let's keep taking down the guards!
ZD913516	D<#000000	o	#FFFFFF>sa	Aghhh!
<color=#FF423F>Money</color>... I need more <color=#FF423F>money</color>!
ZD913517	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	I know it ain't real cash	 but I feel kinda
bad for him.
ZD913518	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	Ah... That cry of anguish	 welling up from
deep within the soul! You can feel the pain
so vividly!
ZD913520	P<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>nther	Wh-What is that? A giant pink...pig?
ZD913521	Fo<#000000	x	#FFFFFF>	That shape... It could only be an enormous
piggy bank. How fascinating...
ZD913522	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	No way	 it's gigantic! How are we supposed to
beat something like this!?
ZD913523	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Don't worry	 that "money" beefs us up too.
We can't lose!
ZD913525	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	This just means we made it to the
main course!
ZD913526	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hoom. Your unanimous bravery in the face of
such peril is heartening.
ZD913527	Mo<#000000	n	#FFFFFF>a	Alright	 let's do this! Don't get too scared	
Skull!
ZD913528	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Who're you callin' scared? Let's just beat
the hell out of this guy!
ZD913530	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	I sense it too. A potent attack is imminent.
Everyone	 stand your ground!
ZD913531	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Huh? More <color=#FF423F>fake money</color>?
ZD913533	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... It likely gives us the fake cash only
to collect it again.
ZD913535	S<#000000	k	#FFFFFF>ull	Is this that "money laundering" thing?
I don't really get it...
ZD913536	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we all have fake money	 most of it will be
taken back. In short...
ZD913538	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	You catch on quick. We can use skills on our
allies to transfer the fake money.
ZD226020	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>chine Shadow	You're going to regret underestimating me!
ZD226021	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	They seem to be filling that apparatus
with energy...
ZD226022	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>chine Shadow	Ahhh	 I feel like a new man.
ZD226023	S<#000000	h	#FFFFFF>un Kano	What!? Why did this guy come back?
ZD226024	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	The energy filling that apparatus must be
able to heal things.
ZD226025	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	But there are limits. It's bound to run out
sooner or later.
ZD226026	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>chine Shadow	You're quite tenacious...
I guess I should get serious	 too.
ZD226027	M<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>chine Shadow	I know your taste now.
Those attacks won't work on me this time!
ZD226028	Mo<#000000	t	#FFFFFF>oha Arai	Taste!? A taste of what!?
ZD226029	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Seems he has put up a barrier attuned to
our attacks... How troublesome.
ZD226030	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	If we attack him with an attribute he
remembers	 he'll just absorb it.
ZD829051	Da<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>soujou	Please use your power
to put an end to my doubts...
ZD829055	Da<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>soujou	I'm extremely grateful... I can't begin to
express my thanks.
ZD829056	Da<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>soujou	Ah... It seems my mind is still trapped
in a state of confusion...
ZD829061	Da<#000000	i	#FFFFFF>soujou	This heavenly maiden is my guide...
Please	 put an end to my doubts...
ZD829011	J<#000000	a	#FFFFFF>ck Frost	If we're attacked	 we'll hit 'em right back!
ZD829012	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Hmm... Maybe we can make use of
that Shadow's cold air somehow.
ZD273251	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	A bad energy is coming from those scales...
Be cautious of the balance.
ZD273252	L<#000000	u	#FFFFFF>fel	Be careful with Angel and Succubus. They have
a particular set of attacks...

Metaverse	 so these must be products
of cognition.

ZD913524	AAAAAA==	Yes. Together	 we are invincible.
ZD913529	AAAAAA==	This aura... I have a bad feeling!
ZD913532	AAAAAA==	Why is he scattering it around like that?
What's going on?
ZD913534	AAAAAA==	I see... It's like money laundering.
