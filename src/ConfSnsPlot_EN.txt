1000	I know we'll be gone a while	
but make sure to eat properly	
okay dear?
1001	We've just arrived at the
airport.
1002	I can't remember the last time
I went on a trip with your
father...
1003	We'll be sure to bring you
back some souvenirs	 so look
forward to it.
1004	And we've left you some money
to cover any expenses	
so don't go wasting it.
1005	If you have any trouble	
you can always talk to
the neighbors	 okay?
1006	And don't forget to lock up
when you leave the house!
1010	Hey! Is this {NAME2}-kun?
1011	It's Motoha!
1012	Yup!|Wrong number.
1013	Great!
1026	Haha. Hilarious.
1014	You're goofier than I thought.
1029	Right	 so...
1015	I may have found a shop that
looks super useful to help us
infiltrate the palace.
1027	Do you have time tomorrow
after school?
1016	I'm free.|Let me check my schedule.
1017	Great! Thanks!
1018	Thanks.
1019	So tomorrow after school.
1028	At Central Street	 'kay?
1020	Are you okay? The house
doesn't feel too empty	
does it?
1021	I'm doing fine.|It really doesn't.
1022	By the way	 feel free to use
whatever's in the fridge if
you feel like cooking.
1023	By the way	 feel free to use
whatever's in the fridge if
you feel like cooking.
1024	And remember to water the
plants outside.
1025	The thought just popped
into my head	 so I thought
I'd let you know. Take care!
1040	Good morning! It's morning
there	 isn't it?
1041	How are you doing?
1042	I'm just a bit worried about
you since we won't be back for
a while.
1043	Make sure you're eating
enough	 okay?
1044	Thanks	 Mom.|Don't worry	 I'm fine.
1050	How's it going?
1051	I just dropped Tomoko off
at home.
1052	Finished up at the clinic.|We have the drugs.
1053	Oh! Guess it went well then.
1054	Now we can finally
start searching for
the next Palace	 right?
1055	I'm good to go whenever	
so hit me up when you
wanna search Mementos!
1060	Hey Leader	 I got a favor to
ask you.
1061	I'll be waiting in the
classroom	 so be sure
to come	 okay?
1070	Made a group chat so we can
get in touch easily!
1071	Great	 thanks!
1072	Oh btw	 I forgot to ask
earlier	 but...
1073	When's Miyazawa's change of
heart supposed to happen?
1074	Shouldn't take too long.|Probably tomorrow?
1075	I think so too. Kiuchi changed
a lot faster than we expected.
1076	Really? That makes me feel
better.
1077	All right	 I'm goin' to
bed then.
1078	Wait	 what about your
homework?
1079	I did what I could.
1080	'Night	 guys.
1081	He definitely didn't do it.
1082	Welp	 I'm off to bed too then.
'Night!
1083	Good night.|Great work today	 everyone.
1090	I heard from Masa-san.
1091	A message came through
Miyazawa's manager apologizing
to Victory Kitchen.
1092	And the rights to the shop
were returned to Pops.
1093	We did it!|So the change of heart worked.
1094	Yeah.
1095	But I can't relax till I hear
it straight from the horse's
mouth.
1096	Apparently he's holding an
emergency press conference
this afternoon.
1097	Sorry I'm late!
1098	Tomoko just told me
the same thing.
1099	Do you guys wanna watch the
press conference together at
lunch?
1100	Okay. See you guys on
the roof.

talk to Kano-kun?
1181	Can you come back to the
classroom? There's something
you should see.
1182	On my way.|See you there.
1183	Cool. Try to hurry	 okay?
1200	I added Riko-senpai to our
chat group!
1201	Thanks	 Motoha.
1202	How ya feelin'	 Senpai?
1203	Thank you for asking. I got
home safe and I'm about to
turn in.
1204	Shoot! Did we wake you up?
1205	Good night! Sleep tight!
1206	It's fine	 really!
1207	But I'll take your suggestion
and look forward to continuing
our chat tomorrow.
1208	Sleep well	 everyone.
See you at school.
Goodnight.
1209	Goodnight.|See you tomorrow.
1210	Thanks! Night!
1211	Nighty night!
1230	You two free tonight?
Wanna hit up Pops's shop?
1231	Heritage Kitchen?
In Zoshigaya?
1232	Yeah. Pops is doin' a lot
better lately.
1233	So he opened the shop back
up.
1234	I heard.|He offered me a job.
1235	What!?
1236	Why didn't you say somethin'?
I only just found out!
1237	Well	 {NAME2}'s house is
close to the shop.
1238	Oh right. That makes sense.
1239	Well	 Masa-san's stoppin' by
tonight to celebrate Pops's
recovery.
1240	So we'll get to eat both
Pops's and Masa-san's ramen.
Wanna go?
1241	YES!
1242	That was fast!
What about you	 {NAME2}?
1243	Of course I'll go.|Can Lufel come too?
1244	That settles it! We'll meet at
Heritage Kitchen tonight!
1245	If we rent the place out	
Lufel can finally eat his
roast pork and stewed eggs.
1246	Ah	 if we rent it out	
pets might be okay.
1247	Let's ask Yamagoshi-san.
Maybe this time Lufel can eat
roast pork and stewed eggs.
1248	Okay. See you guys tonight at
Heritage Kitchen then!
1260	Did you see what's on
Divine Justice?
1261	Yeah! What the heck was that?
1262	I was wondering what
Magatsushin would post	
but this...
1263	I'm not so worried about
grades that I'd try to pay my
way out.
1264	Yeah	 you took the words
right out of my mouth!
1265	But even if it's a lie	 it
still bothers me.
1266	It's slander	 and it's taking
a real toll...
1267	Perhaps that is a way of
stealing desires...
1268	It definitely is.|Even indirectly...
1269	Are they just posting
whatever they want to try to
wear me down?
1270	Akashi is unbelievable...
1271	Anyways	 I've been called to
the faculty office. I need
to go now.
1272	Good luck! And stay safe!
4001	Hey	 uhh...
are you busy lately?
4002	Since I decided to become
a Phantom Thief	 I've been
doing some thinking...
4003	and I figured that I really
need to keep in shape.
4004	So I've decided to get back
into exercising.
4005	I mean	 I could barely
even move when we
were in the Metaverse!
4006	It was honestly pathetic...
4007	But I know that if I exercise
by myself	 I'm probably gonna
slack off.
4008	So if you have the time	
do you think you could be
my workout buddy?
4009	Please!
4010	Are you ready to
enter Mementos?
4011	Ready when you are.
4012	I'm all set.
10001	Greetings.
10002	Do you think I could borrow
a moment of your time?
10003	You see	 I'm rather curious
about these Ferris Wheels.
10004	Would you care to
ride one with me	
at your next convenience?
10005	By all means.|I'm curious about them	 too.
10006	I am pleased to hear that.
I shall be waiting for you.
10007	I happened to see a girl
playing the guitar on
the streets of Shibuya.
10008	I believe she more than has
the potential to become
an idol.
10009	You a talent scout now?|I'd like to see her play.
10010	I suppose I have something
of an eye for talent.
10011	Then I wish for you
to accompany me
next time.
10012	I would like to wish you
a happy birthday.
10013	Thanks.|I appreciate it.
10014	You are most welcome.
10015	I see that you have grown
even stronger.
10016	I sure have.|But things are getting tough.
10017	Might I suggest taking on
some tougher Trials from
the Sea of Souls?
20001	Hey	 you busy?
20002	A new ramen place
opened up near school.
20003	And they're running
this opening promo.
20004	You wanna go check it out
with me?
20005	You bet I do.|Yeah	 I'm kinda curious.
20006	Great. Then let's plan
a day to go sometime!
20007	Math class is so hard.
None of it's making
any sense to me.
20008	How am I gonna cope...?
20009	I'll teach you.|I'm terrible at math	 too.
20010	Really? You're a lifesaver!
20011	Well	 I'm glad I'm not
the only one...
20012	Hey	 happy birthday!
20013	Appreciate it.|Thanks!
20014	Hope you have a great day!
20015	Wow	 you've gotten
pretty strong	 huh?
20016	You know it.|Doesn't mean things are easy.
20017	How about hitting the batting
cages after school?
20230301	Think you could come along
with me today...?
20230302	You wanna go there now?
20230303	I promise to have
your back... so be sure
to give it your all.
20230304	There's something I wanted to
ask you about. Do you have
some time to spare?
20230305	Hey	 I wanna talk to you
about something...
20230306	Just let me know when
you have the time.
100000	{NAME2}	
you take the train
to school	 right?
100001	How do you usually
pass the time?
100002	On my phone.|Thinking about life.
100003	Oh	 I see.
Same here	 actually.
100004	Do you do anything else?
100005	Something like... working out?
100006	Hey	 did you see the news
on TV just now?
100007	I saw us in an interview!
100008	But we're Phantom Thieves?|We got interviewed?
100009	For a split second	
we crossed behind the person
getting interviewed!
100010	To think that our faces
would end up on live TV!
What a great find.
100011	There was this really cool guy
when I was out running
this morning.
100012	He's a one-hundred-year-old
grandpa who lives in the
neighborhood.
100013	He told me he's been
running every morning
for ninety years!
100014	Amazing.|Sounds like a great goal.
100015	I know	 right? I can't let
myself lose to some gramps!
100016	I wanted to watch an action
movie	 so I subscribed to a
streaming service.
100017	But almost all the films
I wanted to watch aren't
available there anymore.
100018	Do you have any
recommendations
for a good movie?
100019	Romance.|You should try horror.
100020	Huh	 I had no idea you
watched romance flicks	
{NAME2}.
100021	I've never been into them.
Maybe I should give them
a chance.
100022	Horror? I kinda hate
jump scares...
100023	But I guess if I'm gonna
be a Phantom Thief	
I'll need some gall.
100024	I'll consider it as training
my mental fortitude.
100025	Thanks again! I'll get back to
you when I'm done watching.
100026	Why are fries so
freaking good?
100027	That's random.|What're you talking about?
100028	Since I've been training
a lot lately...
100029	I've been looking up
the amount of calories
in different foods.
100030	French fries have waaay too
many. It made me so sad.
100031	Are they your favorite?|Just burn it off.
100032	If a menu's got fries	
they'll always end up
on my tray.
100033	I need to work on
my self-restraint.
100034	I see... All I gotta do is
just exercise more to
compensate?
100035	Work hard	 eat hard!
Two birds with one stone!
100036	Last week's math homework
100037	You know	 those ten pages
in the workbook?
100038	That's due the day
after tomorrow	 right?
100039	Uh	 it's due tomorrow.|Bad news...
100040	Aaaaahhhhh!!!
I knew it! Nooo!
100041	That means you finished it	
right	 {NAME2}?
100042	Please	 I'm begging you.
Let me copy your homework!
100043	I'll give you some pointers.|I'll show you how to do them.
100044	Yaaay!
100045	Yeah	 a few hints and I should be able to do the rest on my own.
100046	{NAME2}	 my savior!
I'm under your tutelage!
100047	I'm super grateful.
I'll thank you properly later!
100048	I haven't been able to
sleep well lately.
100049	Got any ideas on how to
improve your sleep quality?
100050	Warming up your feet helps.|Try eating dinner early.
100051	Really? I didn't know that!
I'll give that a go tonight.
100052	You give good advice on
more than just training.
100053	I'm really glad
you're my coach	
{NAME2}.
100054	It's high time I stepped up
to your expectations!
100055	Don't overdo it.|Hey	 take it easy.
100056	Don't worry about me	
I've got this.
100057	I'm gonna give it my all
tomorrow too! Talk soon!
100058	Uh oh	 I think I'm gonna be
late for school.
100059	Have trouble sleeping?|Are you feeling sick?
100060	Nope	 train was just late.
Just my luck lol.
Actually slept like a log.
100061	{NAME2}	
remember the sleeping tip
you gave me?
100062	It's been working great.
My sleep's never been better!
100063	Didn't mean to get you
all worried.
100064	Just get a late train slip.|Train's fault	 so you're safe.
100065	Ah...!
100066	You're totally right!
What am I worrying for?
100067	My head's been in the clouds
lately. I need to get it
together.
100068	I ran past the baseball team
during my run today.
100069	If I hadn't quit the team	
that could've been me
practicing in the field.
100070	You miss baseball?|You regret quitting?
100071	Hmm... I wouldn't say that.
100072	I wouldn't say regret.
100073	I get the feels when I recall
all the fun times I had while
playing baseball.
100074	And also...
100075	I need to throw my weight into
being a Phantom Thief.
100076	It's like we're living our
best lives every day!
100077	On that note	
see you tomorrow!
100078	Hey	 I know this is sudden...
100079	What does it mean to "admire"?
100080	That is really sudden.|Did something happen?
100081	I feel like I generate
a lot of power when
I admire someone.
100082	I've always been the kind of
person to want to stand next
to the one I admire.
100083	I don't know where this power
comes from	 and I never really
thought about it until now.
100084	It seemed kinda mystical
once I started thinking
about it.
100085	Is there someone you admire?|That's what "admire" means.
100086	Umm	 that's top secret.
100087	The reason I can strive
so hard now is because
of the person I admire.
100088	Huh? What do you mean
that's what it means?
100089	Oh	 I guess I answered my
own question already	 huh?
100090	{NAME2}	
you really are amazing.
100091	Thanks for everything!
Let's give it our all
tomorrow	 too!
100092	{NAME2}!
100093	What do you think about me!?
100094	You're a funny one.|Love you	 sweetie.
100095	Excuse me!?
100096	Wh-What in the world?
100097	I'm being serious!
100098	Tomoko said I'm still like
a kid sometimes.
100099	I need you to tell me
that it isn't true	
{NAME2}.
100100	Is she talking about how
I get riled up like this?
100101	Is that being childish!?
100102	Sorry about the joke.|My bad.
100103	Wait	 don't just apologize!
100104	That only supports her
argument that I'm childish!
100105	I thought I knew what
people thought of me.
100106	But I was wrong.
100107	You and Tomoko know me better
than I know myself.
100108	It's like that for everyone.|Act the way you wanna be seen.
100109	Do you feel that way too	
{NAME2}?
100110	Hearing that makes me feel
a little better.
100111	I get that	 but...
100112	There's a huge difference
with how others see me
and how I see myself.
100113	Ugh	 complaining to you
doesn't get me anywhere.
100114	I guess I gotta put in the
effort if I wanna become the
person I view myself to be.
100115	I can't seem to remember
anything we learn at school.
100116	But I can still remember
all the rules in baseball.
100117	How did you learn them?|That's 'cause it's your hobby.
100118	Hmmm	 come to think of it...
it's more like the rules are
ingrained in my body.
100119	For school	 I have to
squeeze all the information
into my brain.
100120	But when it comes to baseball	
I guess they're infused with
my muscle memory?
100121	You're probably right.
It's easier to remember
what you like.
100122	I can't recall important dates
in history	 but I'll never
forget a friend's birthday.
100123	Plus	 I'd be at a disadvantage
if I didn't know the rules
of baseball.
100124	Maybe schoolwork is
the same then?
100125	If I just change my attitude	
then maybe everything will
start sticking in my head?
100126	I'm gonna try a few
strategies out.
100127	About today's modern lit
homework...
100128	What did you put for your
answer to the last question?
100129	I haven't done it yet.|What was the question?
100130	What kind of person do you
want to be in the future?
100131	Answer in 50 words or less.
100132	There's no way I can sum up
a major life question in
50 words or less.
100133	You take things so seriously.|Focus on the biggest thing.
100134	It's harder for me to just
wing it and not give a damn.
100135	But this may be the very
answer to the type of person
I want to become.
100136	The biggest thing about the
type of person I want to be...
100137	The type to protect and defend
what I believe in?
100138	I feel like I can write this
now. Thanks	 {NAME2}.
100139	Hey	 remember when I asked you
for film recommendations on
that streaming platform?
100140	Yeah.|How'd it go?
100141	I was so captivated!
It was really good!
100142	Didn't realize the story was
so sad. I straight up cried
at the end.
100143	I thought our work as Phantom
Thieves would've made me more
resilient to this kinda stuff.
100144	Looks like I still have
a ways to go.
100145	Nothing wrong with crying.|Let's get stronger together.
100146	I feel refreshed now that
I've let it all out.
100147	Awesome. I'm always ready
for some coaching!
100148	Let me know your other movie
recs too. We can catch a flick
on the big screen next time.
100149	And that's a promise!
100150	There's a new movie out
on the streaming service
I signed up to.
100151	It looks super interesting.
100152	I'm listening.|What sort of movie is it?
100153	It's like a nonstop
punch to the feels.
100154	The reviews say you'll be
caught in an endless cycle
of tears and laughter.
100155	Can't even imagine.|Great for emotional training.
100156	Yeah	 me neither. How do you
go from laughing to crying
so quickly?
100157	Yeah	 I heard that movie
takes you on an emotional
roller-coaster.
100158	If I'm going to be
a Phantom Thief...
100159	I need to have full control
over my emotions. Is that
called a poker face?
100160	Anyway	 I'm going to
put the show on now.
100161	Lemme know when you've
finished watching it	
{NAME2}.
100162	We should have an emotional
endurance contest to see
who can last the longest!
100163	When everyone was
on break today...
100164	Someone outside the classroom
randomly yelled...
100165	Cream Soda!
100166	Why?|Who?
100167	No idea. I just heard
someone yell it out.
100168	But because of that...
100169	All I can think about today
is cream soda.
100170	I haven't been able to learn
a single thing in class
all day because of it.
100171	Soda's got you trapped.|Wanna dash to a diner?
100172	Oh no... I was trapped in an
endless cream soda mind loop!
100173	Nngh... I need to pull
myself together.
100174	Yeah! I'm actually heading
to one right now.
100175	Time to enjoy a nice	
ice-cold cream soda!
100176	Thanks for always listening
to my randomness.
100177	Did you hear what everyone was
talking about in class today?
100178	No	 I didn't.|What were they talking about?
100179	They were talking about
dating your best friend.
100180	Those people just love talking
about dating	 you know.
100181	Everyone had something to
say about whether they'd
give up or give in.
100182	Then it was my turn to
answer	 but I didn't know
what to say.
100183	{NAME2}	
would you date
your best friend?
100184	Nope.|I'd go for it.|Not sure.
100185	I see... You're a good
friend with a kind heart	
{NAME2}.
100186	I expect no less from a leader
like you! Once you lock on	
you never lose your target!
100187	Fair enough. For some reason	
that makes me glad.
100188	Sorry for the weird question!
See ya tomorrow!
100500	Hey	 you free now?
100501	Was hoping to ask you a favor.
100502	Sure.|Not now.
100503	Awesome! Let's meet somewhere.
100504	Oh	 okay.
Maybe some other time.
100505	Didn't mean to put you
on the spot	 sorry. Let me
know when you're free.
100600	Did you see the commercial for
the new films that were just
added to that streaming site?
100601	A bunch of them seem like
they'd totally be your thing!
100602	If you've got time later on	
let's discuss which ones
to check out!
100603	I'm down.|I need to check my schedule.
100604	Great! Well	 you know
where to find me!
100605	No problem.
I'll be at my usual spot
if you're free.
100606	Right	 you must be pretty
busy. No rush	 just let me
know when you have time.
110000	Are you making proper use
of the Phantom Idols?
110001	Though they may be products
of cognition	 they possess the
strength of a Phantom Thief.
110002	Your leadership will decide
whether they succeed or fail.
110003	I'll keep that in mind.|They are reliable allies.
110004	Well then	 it seems my support
has been worthwhile.
110005	Please use the Phantom Idols
to their fullest potential.
110006	Are you interested in idols?
110007	I am.|Not really.
110008	From what I have observed	
you share many traits.
110009	Much like an object of
worship	 an idol embodies the
desires of their believers.
110010	I have seen that same
potential in you.
110011	Squee!
110012	What do you mean?|Squee!
110013	I have discovered a magic
spell that charms people.
110014	As such	 this charm has the
potential to raise desire.
110015	Please recite along.
110016	Squee!|SQUEE!!!
110017	I appear to be unaffected...
The inner workings of such a
spell remain a mystery to me.
110018	Still	 I have full confidence
that your skill is not
to blame.
110019	Next time	 I would like you
to reattempt the spell with
the pose for me.
110020	I have utmost faith in
your capabilities.
110021	Since our visit to Akihabara	
I have looked into
concept cafés.
110022	The girl named Narumi
referred to her establishment
as an "idol con café."
110023	In other words	 she is
an employee there.
110024	She's not the real deal?|Does that count as an idol?
110025	I could sense a strong
conviction within her.
110026	At the very least	 she has the
qualities I seek in an idol.
110027	Whether or not she is one
makes little to no difference.
110028	If you say so.|She was cute.
110029	I appreciate your
understanding.
110030	To further our contract	
please learn to be more
like her.
110031	According to my research
on idol photo shoots...
110032	There is much depth to taking
a photo with your idol.
110033	How you greet her beforehand
is of vital importance.
110034	Really?|I don't get it.
110035	Your current mindset
worries me terribly.
110036	You are meant to be like an
idol	 much like I am a fan.
110037	As the leader of the Phantom
Thieves	 you must connect with
your allies and build trust.
110038	I highly recommend you
follow Naruru's example.
110039	You have a point.|Sounds like work...
110040	Such a task is elementary
for you. Be diligent.
110041	After our photo shoot
the other day...
110042	I believe you've begun to
understand Naruru's charm.
110043	I wouldn't go that far...|Almost a full-fledged fan!
110044	Take it slow and steady.
That is what is most
important.
110045	Our contract is
proceeding smoothly.
110046	I hear there is a saying:
What one likes,
one does well.
110047	Support Naruru further	
and our contract will
proceed swimmingly.
110048	Is that how it works?|You just want to convert me.
110049	For now	 I shall welcome you
as a fellow fan.
110050	I can educate you on
Naruru's charm another time.
110051	Are you familiar with
live-action hero shows?
110052	It seems many idols appear in
them before rising to fame.
110053	This again...?|I wouldn't know.
110054	I came across such a show
while strolling Akihabara.
110055	The performers hid their
faces	 so I could not tell
who they were.
110056	What exactly makes someone
a live-action hero?
110057	Their names end with -man.|They're called Rangers.
110058	I admit I am not familiar
with such names.
110059	This clearly requires
further investigation.
110060	I will also have to look into
these "live-action effects."
110061	I have researched the duties
of a producer.
110062	They act as an idol's mentor
and key partner.
110063	In other words	 the fate of
an idol's career depends
on them.
110064	A corrupt producer can ruin
even the most talented idol.
110065	He's going down.|Let's save Naruru.
110066	With your help	 I have
no doubt this issue
will be resolved.
110067	It will take some time
for his change of heart
to be reflected in reality...
110068	Until then	 I can only
continue to support
Naruru as a fan.
110069	It is times like these when
one's loyalty is tested.
110070	For now	 it is vital that
I "like" Naruru's posts on
the café's social media.
110071	The other day	 I happened
to see Naruru.
110072	She wore not her con café
attire. Instead	 it was a
convenience store uniform.
110073	Did you say hi?|So she's working there?
110074	I knew it wasn't the time
or place to approach her.
110075	After all	 I've learned
private inquiries are taboo.
110076	After all	 I've learned
private inquiries are taboo.
110077	As such	 I shall not even
share details of
the store's location.
110078	That's the right thing to do.|You're a model fan.
110079	I only did what any fan would.
110080	All I can do now is pray for
Naruru to find peace.
110081	Do you recall our discussion
about live-action heroes?
110082	My research has led me to
a popular title called
Phoenix Ranger Featherman.
110083	Live action is a door to
success for many hopeful
actors and idols.
110084	Soon enough	 Naruru will
join their ranks...
110085	I should investigate
live-action heroes further.
110086	What a cultured woman you are.|How far will you go?
110087	This is to better understand
you and other humans.
110088	That is a concierge's duty.
I will persevere.
110089	I ask for your continued
cooperation.
110090	Phoenix Ranger Featherman
apparently has many
installments.
110091	Which Featherman do you like?
110092	I can't decide.|I'm not familiar with it.
110093	I heard that live-action hero
shows are made for children.
110094	Most seem to grow out of it
as they age.
110095	However	 some devout fans
continue to watch even
into adulthood.
110096	I wish for you to become
an adult filled with such
a bountiful desire.
110097	I don't know...|What about idols?
110098	Watching a cast of young	
inexperienced actors
110099	hone their craft over time is
a satisfying sight.
110100	The same concept applies to
supporting one's idol.
110101	Please give live action a try
when you have the chance.
110102	Thank you again for your
assistance with Naruru.
110103	Without you	 we would have
lost her smile.
110104	Did it 'cause you told me to.|Anything for Naruru.
110105	As always	 you exceed
my expectations.
110106	That villainous producer had
a complete change of heart.
110107	Or perhaps what we see now
is his true character.
110108	He was never a bad guy.|He got a bit screwy.
110109	Humans cannot live
without desire.
110110	Left unchecked	 however	
it invites ruin upon oneself
and others.
110111	Needless to say	 I hope you
will exercise due caution.
110112	To possess desire without
yielding to it... That is my
sincere wish for you.
110113	Do you recall two employees
who informed us of
Naruru's plight?
110114	We've become acquainted as I
continue to visit Naruru.
110115	I am ever loyal to Naruru	 but
I also enjoy their company.
110116	Although I am reluctant to use
the term "fan" to describe
my relationship with them.
110117	How about "friends"?|Idol group fan?
110118	Friends? With me?
No	 I couldn't impose.
110119	Though I do not loathe
the notion.
110120	An intriguing proposal... But
would it not require the unit
to consist of multiple idols?
110121	I suppose it would work
if the three were to
form a group...
110122	I sense a newfound desire
rising within me.
110123	Could this be a prelude
to something greater?
110124	I suggest we find the
answer together.
110125	I've given it great thought.
110126	What do you think
of "Meow 3 Stars"
for a unit name?
110127	A unit name?|Um	 what?
110128	I was pondering on the notion
of Naruru and her coworkers
becoming an idol group.
110129	As a legitimate idol	
Naruru would be
in the center.
110130	With Mariyan and Shiyurin
on either side...
110131	Mariyan?|Shiyurin?
110132	Those are their nicknames.
Please memorize them.
110133	I think this unit could work.
110134	Or rather	 it is guaranteed
to succeed.
110135	Calm down.|You've gone beyond fandom.
110136	My sincerest apologies for
my loss of composure.
110137	I am aware that I am a
concierge	 not a producer.
110138	As such	 I wish to clarify
that I would never abandon
my duties.
110139	Please ignore my prior
careless remarks.
110140	In my idol research	 I have
discovered an incredibly
enchanting individual.
110141	After years out of the
public eye	 she has returned
to the spotlight.
110142	Now her idol career shines
brighter than ever.
110143	How did she transform
during her time away?
110144	If possible	 I should
investigate her life
pre-hiatus.
110145	Cheater...|No longer a fan of Naruru?
110146	I ask that you refrain from
misleading comments.
110147	I am merely interested in her
transformation as an idol.
110148	Nevertheless	 please keep this
a secret from Naruru.
110149	The fan appreciation event
was truly splendid.
110150	It felt as if both
idols and fans shared
one heart and mind.
110151	Of course	 that may simply be
my own misconception.
110152	However	 if idols are meant
to show us dreams	 then I do
believe I was dreaming.
110153	It's not a dream.|It's okay to dream.
110154	Just as people once found
gods within nature	
110155	We fans have found our dreams
in idols like Naruru.
110156	I wish nothing but happiness
for both you and Naruru.
110157	It's been quite some time
since I became your concierge.
110158	You've grown far more
than I ever imagined.
110159	It is pointless for
a concierge to sing
her own praises.
110160	But if I was helpful
to you in the slightest	
then I am satisfied.
110161	Of course you were.|Where'd this all come from?
110162	My apologies. My emotions
got the better of me.
110163	This too is proof of your
tremendous growth.
110164	I'm grateful to you too.|You've changed too	 Merope.
110165	You are too kind.
I am grateful enough
as your concierge.
110166	It is I who should be
thanking you.
110167	I have?
110168	Perhaps	 but that is also
entirely thanks to you.
110169	And for that	 I must say	
110170	I look forward to our
continued partnership.
110171	That alone is the
unshakeable truth.
110500	Excuse me. I wish for us to go
somewhere together to better
understand your true self.
110501	I must clarify that this excursion
is not bound by the terms of
our contract. What do you say?
110502	Sure.|I can't...
110503	Then I shall await you
in front of the Velvet Room.
110504	No matter. Another time	 then.
110505	No matter. Another time	 then.
110600	Excuse me. I wish to propose
we do something that differs
to our usual meetings.
110601	I shall brief you on the
details of this proposal
when we meet in person.
110602	No problem.|Lemme get back to you.
110603	Then I shall await you
in front of the Velvet Room.
110604	Understood. Do let me know if
you are interested	 should you
not have other arrangements.
110605	Understood. Do let me know if
you are interested	 should you
not have other arrangements.
120000	Huh huh... I saw you on the
way home today	 {NAME1}-san.
120001	I didn't want to make the
normies suspicious	 so I fled
before they could notice.
120002	You shoulda said hi!|You ignored me? Ouch.
120003	Oh	 I'm sorry. Should I have
revealed myself?
120004	Very well. I shall do so
on the next occasion.
120005	Rumor has it there's an
abandoned building near
our school that's cursed.
120006	Intriguing	 right? My senses
are tingling... It's like I'm
being drawn in...
120007	Mine aren't.|Take care!
120008	Oh come on! You're supposed
to agree to join me!
120009	But...
120010	I guess there is still much to be done...
120011	...before such a feat can be achieved.
120012	Since we're the chosen ones...
120013	We need cover stories to
protect our real identities.
120014	Do you know mine	
{NAME1}-san?
120015	You're an oddball.|The guy who gets bullied?
120016	Wait	 is that really how
people see me?
120017	Hm... If you say so...
But still...
120018	{NAME1}-san
120019	Do you know how to enter
other worlds?
120020	Where did you hear that?|No way. You know too?
120021	I should have expected you
to know	 {NAME1}-san.
120022	If you place four dolls with
different expressions in the
corners of a room at midnight...
120023	It opens a gate to another
world. Or so they say...
120024	Have you tried it too	
{NAME1}-san?
120025	I use a different method.|There's an easier way.
120026	So there's another way!?
You've got to tell me
about it!
120027	I need to know...
What fascinating news!
I must do more research!
120028	I think...
120029	We need aliases.
120030	Aliases?|Like code names?
120031	It's not wise to reveal your
true name in enemy territory.
120032	Yours could be... How about
the Hero of Light?
120033	Exactly! A chosen one must
conceal their true identity.
120034	What about the Hero of Light?
Haha	 I like it.
It's perfect...
120035	I've already got my alias	
by the way.
120036	Darkness?|Prince?
120037	Heh... Can't you see? With the
forces of yin and yang working
in unison	 we are unstoppable!
120038	So make sure to call me
Prince of Darkness
from now on	 Hero of Light!
120039	But if we're not on a mission	
you can just use my real name.
120040	Have you heard about
the cursed video?
120041	I just found out
about it today...
120042	I dug it up from the darkest
depths of the web. I'm sure
it's the real thing.
120043	Shall we watch it later?
We need to see what
it's all about!
120044	I have stuff to do.|You watch it first.
120045	Oh	 I see... Let's do it
another time	 then.
120046	You're chickening out?|Is it really cursed?
120047	N-No	 I'm not!
I'm not scared	
it's just...
120048	I-It really is the real thing	
I swear! Or I wouldn't ask
you to watch it with me.
120049	Anyway... We always have
to stick together for stuff
like this! Safety first!
120050	{NAME1}-san	
have you heard of
the man-faced dog?
120051	The what?|Sounds kind of familiar.
120052	It was a popular ghost story
way back in the day.
120053	I know it's a bit strange
for an old legend like that
to be popular now...
120054	But I found this one that's
been floating around
the web recently...
120055	It's a modern-day ghost story	
but about a dog-faced man	
not a man-faced dog!
120056	It's true! There's a photo
of a guy with a dog's head
driving a car!
120057	It's not an optical illusion?|It's probably been edited.
120058	I suppose I can't deny
the possibility.
120059	And I forgot to save
the photo.
120060	This requires further
investigation. I'll let you
know if I find anything.
120061	{NAME1}-san!
I have a status report!
120062	It's about the dog-faced man
case I mentioned before.
120063	Dog-faced man?|What was that again?
120064	The person with the
head of a dog!
120065	I saw a photo of it
online	 remember?
120066	Well I managed to find
that same image again.
120067	But it looks like it was
just an illusion created
by the camera angle...
120068	The picture just overlapped
the driver and his dog.
120069	It happens.|Case closed!
120070	The information age sure
made it hard to separate
fact from fiction.
120071	My eyes clearly lack the
ability to see through such
illusions. I must train more.
120072	{NAME1}-san	
I think I...
120073	I may have done something...
120074	What happened?|Uh-huh?
120075	I was exploring a mysterious
bookstore when I came across
an old book covered in dust.
120076	Without thinking	
I accidentally read a
line from it out loud...
120077	And the book was a grimoire of
demon-summoning rituals!
120078	Which basically means...
I read an incantation to
conjure some devilish fiend!
120079	The demon could manifest here
at any moment...
120080	{NAME1}-san	
what should I do!?
120081	Be strong	 stand your ground!|I'll negotiate with it.
120082	You're right... I can't
get scared before it
even appears!
120083	You're more confident
than I expected	
{NAME1}-san.
120084	Heh	 of course we can't lose
to some demon...
120085	After all	 we're the
chosen ones!
120086	It's been a while since I read
that demon-summoning spell.
120087	But nothing's come after me.
I haven't even sensed
anything unholy.
120088	Must've been a fake grimoire.|Maybe you read it wrong?
120089	No	 actually I continued
reading the book after that.
120090	And it looks like reciting
an incantation isn't enough
to summon an evil entity.
120091	There's actually a whole ritual
behind it.
120092	In fact	 I just finished doing
it. I hope a demon appears.
Actually	 maybe not...
120093	Which is it?|Are you prepared?
120094	Both	 I think...
I'm half afraid	
half excited... Heh.
120095	Yes... Now that I've spoken
to you	 I'm prepared.
120096	Just watch me. I'm doing this!
120097	{NAME1}-san...
120098	I'm about to send my thoughts
directly into your mind...
120099	Can you tell what I'm
looking at right now?
120100	No clue.|A handkerchief!
120101	Too bad... It was an apple.
120102	Even for chosen ones	
telepathy is difficult.
120103	I get that.|Are you giving up?
120104	You mustn't lose faith	
{NAME1}-san.
120105	Our telepathic powers are sure
to awaken in time!
120106	No. In fact...
120107	I was waiting for you
to say that!
120108	I'm researching how to develop
telepathic abilities.
120109	Look forward to my findings!
Hehehe.
120110	{NAME1}-san...
120111	Did this message surprise you?
120112	It sure did!|No.
120113	I feel like I am able to fully
understand your feelings.
120114	So	 you were able to
sense my emotions?
120115	Hehe... Very good.
I can feel my telepathic
skills awakening.
120116	A long time ago	 I was able
to get my hands on psychic
training tools.
120117	It was only a matter of time
until I harnessed my powers.
120118	So the day has finally come...|Now the fun begins!
120119	My	 my... I really can't
compete with you.
120120	You really read my mind
just now!
120121	Your powers must be
greater than mine.
120122	{NAME1}-san...
120123	Where you get your hair cut?
120124	A place by the station.|A stylist in my neighborhood.
120125	You live in Zoshigaya	 right?
120126	You have good sense of style	
and you blend in so well
with normies.
120127	So I was thinking of using
your style as a point of
reference for my new look.
120128	You care about fashion?|Will that really help?
120129	Even as a chosen one	 I don't
want to be overly conspicuous.
120130	I've been taking secret notes
for some time now	 haha.
120131	If you could give me tips	
I'd appreciate it...
120132	I'd better make an appointment
now. See you tomorrow!
120133	This world is full
of curiosities...
120134	I have to wonder why more
people don't take notice...
120135	What brought this up?|What's this about?
120136	There are miraculous things
to be found everywhere
you look.
120137	But people close their eyes
to it all so easily!
120138	It's the same reason everyone
talks about Menaces.
120139	So I think the purpose of
chosen ones like us...
120140	Must be to make them
remember what it's like
to feel real wonder.
120141	So you understand	 then?|Exactly	 Prince of Darkness.
120142	Yes	 exactly. You get
what I'm saying?
120143	Our purpose is to open
the eyes of the masses!
120144	Ah! Thank you	
{NAME1}-san!
120145	I knew you had good sense	
Hero of Light.
120146	We chosen ones must strive
to fulfill our purpose
however we can!
120147	Listen to this	
{NAME1}-san!
120148	Earlier	 I attempted a ritual
to summon a spirit of
good fortune...
120149	Did they show up?|Not a demon?
120150	I'm not sure... Spirits aren't
usually visible to the
human eye	 after all.
120151	Oh... The demon didn't appear	
and I thought a lucky spirit
would be more useful anyway.
120152	But it doesn't seem like it
worked properly	 either way.
120153	If anything	 it was a spirit
of guidance	 not luck.
120154	I had to help out injured
old folks	 lost children...
120155	Yesterday alone	 I ran into
five different people I had
to save... I'm exhausted.
120156	Good work!|I'm impressed.
120157	Oh	 stop it. Although
I suppose a little praise
is nice... Heh.
120158	Anyway	 I just thought I'd let
you know the spell was fake.
120159	There is another ritual I want
to try next time	 though.
120160	I'll be sure to let you know
how it goes.
120161	{NAME1}-san	
I must apologize...
120162	A major impediment to our
great quest has appeared...
120163	What kind of impediment?|Says who?
120164	Our class president is
transferring at the end
of the month...
120165	And for some reason I was
picked as the replacement.
120166	I was going to refuse
the position at first
120167	But some really
over-the-top types
in class got behind it...
120168	So I ended up as the interim
class president.
120169	You're surprisingly popular!|Classic chosen one stuff.
120170	What do you mean	
surprisingly!?
120171	I mean	 that's true	 I am
a chosen one	 but still!
120172	I'm worried it will get in the
way of my true purpose.
120173	But the trust of the people
can be useful. I intend to put
in the appropriate effort.
120174	Are you good at languages	
{NAME1}-san?
120175	Sure am.|Not really.
120176	We chosen ones are embroiled
in a never-ending battle to
stay informed	 so to speak.
120177	We must search for intel in
print and online ensure our
knowledge is kept up-to-date.
120178	English is handy for reading
books from all over the world.
120179	It's quite useful for online
data collection	 too.
120180	You must be good at English.|Be my overseas tour guide!
120181	Haha	 not to brag	 but you're
speaking to the freshman who
got the top grades in English!
120182	Sorry... I'm good at reading	
but speaking is a bit rough.
120183	I think I'm going to try
translating a grimoire soon.
120184	I'll show it to you
when I'm finished.
120185	Are you good at math	
{NAME1}-san?
120186	Sure am.|My homeroom teacher is.
120187	Then	 this is a bit
embarrassing	 but...
120188	I have to take a supplementary
test for math soon.
120189	Of course I know the
basics of numerology	
but equations...
120190	So I was wondering if
you might be able to
instruct me
120191	You can count on me.|I'll whip you into shape!
120192	Really!? Thank you so much!
120193	I am prepared! I'm not a
chosen one for nothing!
120194	That's a relief	 though.
120195	I've never had to ask
someone for something
like this before.
120196	I've got to pass this time
and restore my honor!
120500	The time has come	 {NAME1}.
A new threat has emerged	
and I'm going to gather intel.
120501	I need to check out a student
hot spot. Can you come?
120502	Okay.|I can't.
120503	Excellent	 fellow chosen one.
Let's go investigate.
120504	Oh	 I see. Ping me next time
you're available.
120600	{NAME1}-san	 regarding
our usual investigations...
120601	I was thinking of doing
something a little different
this time... Care to join me?
120602	No problem.|Lemme get back to you.
120603	AAAAAA==
120604	Very well. I shall be at my
usual place	 so just let me
know if you're interested.
130000	Hey {NAME1}-kun	
what do you look for
in a part-time job?
130001	I'm actually looking for one
right now.
130002	It's hard for me to figure out
what to prioritize here.
130003	The pay's gotta be good.|Gotta be easy work.
130004	Hm... Yeah	 that makes sense.
I think it's the same for me.
130005	Thanks	 I'll see
what's around.
130006	You sit behind Motoha	 right	
{NAME1}-kun?
130007	Do you guys talk a lot?
130008	Yeah	 quite a lot lately.|She does most of the talking.
130009	Honestly	 I'm a little
jealous. I wish I was in the
same class as you guys.
130010	We should all eat lunch
together sometime!
130011	Hey	 {NAME1}-kun	
you live by yourself	 right?
130012	Do you make your own dinner?
That must be tough.
130013	I can make whatever I like.|I just order whatever I want.
130014	Huh	 so that's what living
alone is like?
130015	If there's anything I can do
to help	 just say the word!
130016	Do you watch movies
on streaming services	
{NAME1}-kun?
130017	I'd spend hours watching
videos online until recently.
130018	You see	 I haven't really
felt like it since I broke
my shoulder...
130019	But then Motoha was raving
about this one streaming site	
so I signed up.
130020	It made me curious to know
what movies my other friends
are watching.
130021	What kind of movies do you
like	 {NAME1}-kun?
130022	Ones by famous directors!|Comedies all the way.
130023	Huh	 okay! I'll check out
one or two when I have
the time.
130024	Thank you for the
recommendation!
130025	I'll share my thoughts once
I've given them a watch.
130026	What do you do in your spare
time	 {NAME1}-kun?
130027	Until recently	 I've always
spent my free time hanging
with friends.
130028	Like Motoha and
my teammates...
130029	But everyone's so busy now	
I hardly get a chance to
invite them out.
130030	What would you do if you were
in my position?
130031	Whatever I feel like!|Well	 I'm always free to chat.
130032	Whatever I feel like...
130033	Okay...
130034	Do you mind if I message
you to talk like this
from time to time?
130035	Works for me.|You all good now?
130036	Great. I feel a lot better.
130037	Thanks for listening to me.
I'll catch you later.
130038	Mind if I pick your brain?
130039	So! I've saved up quite a bit
from my part-time jobs.
130040	And I thought I'd buy my
mom and dad something
with the money.
130041	Their anniversary's coming up
too	 so it's good timing.
130042	That's really nice of you.|I'm sure they'll be thrilled.
130043	Thanks!
130044	But I actually don't know what
sort of things they like.
130045	I know they'll just tell me
anything's good if I ask...
130046	I guess they want you to pick.|You should trust your taste.
130047	I see... That makes sense.
130048	Thanks	 I'll give it a little
more thought	 then.
130049	Say	 {NAME1}-kun	
what's your take on
spicy food?
130050	Keep talking...|Thanks	 but no thanks.
130051	So	 I'm still working at
that diner in Shibuya.
130052	They held a contest for their
hot n' spicy original menu.
130053	The line cooks went all out	
and made some crazy dishes.
130054	But the manager threw in
the towel after one bite...
130055	None of us can stomach it	
not even the guys who
cooked it!
130056	None of us can stomach it	
not even the guys who
cooked it!
130057	So now they're in the market
for some taste testers...
130058	What do you say	
{NAME1}-kun?
Think you can take the heat?
130059	Not a chance.|You've piquant-ed my interest.
130060	I'm with you on that one!
That's the right call	
no matter how you slice it.
130061	Um... You know what	 forget
I said anything! I'm asking
too much of you.
130062	You need guts of steel for
something like this. I mean	
my manager literally fainted.
130063	Sorry for bringing up such a
spicy	 uh	 dicey proposition!
130064	Would you say you've got good
eyesight	 {NAME1}-kun?
130065	20-20 vision.|Nope.
130066	Really? Wow	 luckyyy!
130067	Oh	 well	 welcome to the club.
130068	I had to get my glasses after
I hit the books too hard.
130069	My eyesight was still pretty
good back when I was
playing baseball...
130070	But now that I've quit...
it's only getting worse.
130071	Well	 I couldn't tell.|Maybe training might help?
130072	Really? You couldn't?
130073	Maybe all these jobs
are keeping my eyes
in peak condition...
130074	Good idea... Maybe it's
not too late to get my
visual acuity back.
130075	I haven't been to the batting
cages in forever	 either.
130076	At any rate	 I'll do my best
to make sure it doesn't
get any worse!
130077	I got a frantic message from
Motoha. She was like...
130078	I'm totally gonna fail this
test! Help me cram!
130079	But I don't know the first
thing about tutoring...
130080	Do you?
130081	Just call me sensei.|Me? Teaching?
130082	So you do? Now that's
quite something.
130083	Yeah	 fair enough. It's easier
said than done	 right?
130084	I have a real hard time
compartmentalizing things.
130085	Divvying ideas up into
teachable chunks
is hard.
130086	Still	 there must be
some way	 right?
130087	How was it in baseball?|Try teaching by example.
130088	Come to think of it	 teaching
techniques was pretty easy!
130089	Huh... So like	 show Motoha
how I study for exams?
130090	Oh	 I think you might be onto
something there. Thanks!
130091	Motoha didn't fail!
130092	Congratulations!|Good job	 Teach.
130093	Thanks	 but maybe save the
congrats for Motoha.
130094	Thanks! But Motoha's the one
who put in all the work.
130095	I taught her a bunch of stuff
when we used to play baseball.
130096	So	 I tried to remember how I
went about things back then.
130097	Once she absorbs a technique	
Motoha never forgets it.
130098	Sooo	 I just had to think
about how she took
the information in.
130099	Once I figured it out	
our study session was
a breeze!
130100	Coach Tomoko in the house!|I'd love to join in next time.
130101	Hee hee! You're the second one
to call me that	 after Motoha.
130102	Oh	 good idea! All three of us
for the next study session.
130103	I'll reach out when the next
test period's coming up!
130104	Hey	 I could use your help.
130105	Got any friends who'd be
interested in women's
baseball gear?
130106	Not that I know of.|Who's asking?
130107	Um... Well	 I can't play
anymore	 right?
130108	I made sure to keep everything
that was important to me.
130109	But... I have no clue what
to do with my spare mitt
and stuff I don't need.
130110	It's new	 but it's a little on
the small side. Besides...
130111	Not a lot of girls trying out
for catcher these days.
130112	I'd hate to throw it out	 but
if I can't find any takers...
130113	Sell it at a flea market!|Donate it to your old team.
130114	Oh	 that'd work!
I bet I'll find someone
who wants it!
130115	Good idea! That way it's sure
to end up in the hands of
someone who needs it.
130116	Glad I came to you.
I'll let you know
how it goes!
130117	I found someone to take my
spare baseball equipment!
130118	That's great!|Who?
130119	An elementary schooler.
Turns out it was the
perfect fit	 too!
130120	She wants to be a pro player
when she grows up!
130121	So I made sure to focus all
my positive energy into it
before handing it off.
130122	You know... I thought I was
over it when I had to quit
playing baseball.
130123	I figured it would be best to
just put it all behind me.
130124	But now	 I think my love for
it is a good thing... Maybe?
130125	Of course it is.|If you have no regrets	 sure.
130126	Yeah. Hey	 thanks for that.
130127	I do love baseball.
I really do!
130128	You're probably not interested
in stuff like this	 but...
130129	I just heard something pretty
incredible... Can I tell you?
130130	I still go to the hospital for
regular checkups	 right?
130131	Well	 apparently a pro
baseball player from
way back is there!
130132	That is pretty incredible!|At the hospital?
130133	Sounds like he was admitted.
He is pretty old	 after all.
130134	I imagine most people wouldn't
recognize him by name alone.
130135	But diehard fans like me and
my folks know it anywhere.
130136	Hope you get to talk to him!|Ask for his autograph!
130137	Not gonna lie	
I kinda want to!
130138	Still	 it's a hospital.
I can't just barge in
on him.
130139	Hope he gets better soon!
130140	I went to go cheer on my old
baseball team the other day!
130141	The coach and everyone
on the team invited me
to come watch.
130142	It was a real nail-biter.
They eked out a draw
somehow...
130143	I thought that me dropping out
suddenly caused huge problems.
130144	But they all just said they're
doing fine and... like...
130145	Sorry... I'm just venting
more than anything.
130146	It's good that you went.|You okay?
130147	Yeah. I feel better now.
Thanks for listening.
130148	Oh	 right. The music club came
to support the game	 too!
130149	So	 I asked them about making
a song to cheer on Kotone-san.
130150	I'll let you know if we make
any progress!
130151	Do you remember that baseball
pro staying at my hospital?
130152	How could I forget?|Did you get to meet him?
130153	I ran into him last time
I went in. Right in
the courtyard!
130154	At first I thought he was just
some guy in a wheelchair...
130155	But when the nurse wheeled
him by	 I recognized his face
right away!
130156	I let it slip that I was
a big fan	 and	 well...
130157	He thanked me for remembering
him	 and burst into tears.
130158	Must be lonely when all the
fans who knew you are gone...
130159	Good thing you spoke up.|So	 about that autograph?
130160	Yeah	 I got to hear tons of
great tales about his heyday.
130161	Right! He was super happy
to sign one for me.
130162	I'm really glad I got to
meet him.
130163	Sorry	 just wanted to update
you. Thanks for listening.
130164	So	 about that song I asked
the music club to perform
for Kotone-san.
130165	I couldn't exactly get
everyone on board...
130166	But a bunch of them actually
agreed to do it!
130167	That's good to hear.|Will they be enough?
130168	Yeah	 brass band tends to be
pretty loud	 so it'll be fine.
130169	It's just...
130170	Trying to decide on which song
to perform was tough.
130171	None of our ideas stood out.
Not really	 anyway.
130172	What do you think would work
for cheering on Kotone-san?
130173	Something from the heart!|One that'll pump her up.
130174	Hmm... Yeah	 I can see that.
130175	Oh	 I'll use the one we played
when I would step up to bat.
130176	Thanks a lot. I'll let the
music club know!
130177	You'll never guess what
I heard about Kotone-san's
next big competition.
130178	Apparently she's going to
skate to the song I chose
for her!
130179	Where'd you hear that?|She can skate to that...?
130180	I heard Kotone-san called the
music club over yesterday.
130181	She asked them to do a studio
recording of the song.
130182	They messaged me earlier
telling me how nerve-racking
it was.
130183	Although they did make sure to
squeeze in a humblebrag about
getting autographs after.
130184	Still	 can you even
believe it?
130185	Kotone-san	 performing to
the song I chose...
130186	What an honor.|Feeling nervous about it?
130187	Yeah! That	 and I'm just
so happy.
130188	A little bit	 yeah... But more
happy than anything else.
130189	I can hardly wait for
the competition!
130190	Did you see the news today?
130191	There was an article
about Kotone-san.
130192	Her comeback at the next
competition is all anybody's
talking about.
130193	She's still getting the same
nasty comments as before...
130194	But	 a lot of people
seem pretty excited
to see her return!
130195	Like us.|And how does Kotone feel?
130196	Yeah! We'd better do all we
can to cheer her on.
130197	I haven't heard anything
from her yet.
130198	It sounds like she's awfully
busy with practice	 anyway.
130199	Oh yeah	 she did say
she'll get some tickets
to the competition!
130200	That means one for you too	
of course. We should go
see it! Together	 I mean.
130201	Better make sure I don't
have any work that day.
130500	Hi! I know this is a bit
out of the blue	 but
are you free today?
130501	There's someplace I'd like
to go with you. If you
have the time	 of course.
130502	Fine by me.|Today's kinda busy	 actually.
130503	Great	 thanks so much!
So	 where's a good spot
for us to meet?
130504	Ah	 I see. Sorry to hear it...
There's always
next time!
130505	I was thinking of studying
for that quiz tomorrow...
130600	I was thinking of studying
for that quiz tomorrow...
130601	But I have a bit of a problem.
Are you free	 by any chance	
{NAME2}?
130602	Sure	 I can help.|Sorry	 kinda busy...
130603	Great! I'll wait for you
at my usual spot.
130604	That's okay	 it doesn't have
to be right now. I'll be at my
usual spot if you're free.
140000	I've been worried about my
skin lately. I'm usually
careful with it	 but still!
140001	Do you have any kind
of skincare routine	
{NAME2}-chan?
140002	Not in particular.|I have a couple products.
140003	Oh	 the luster of youth!
I'm jealous that your skin
can look so good.
140004	Oh! That's kids these days
for you.
140005	I'll do my best to get my skin
looking as beautiful as yours	
{NAME2}-chan!
140006	So	 I saw this ad on TV.
140007	It got me going to a burger
shop for the first time
in what must be forever.
140008	Burgers are so expensive
these days	 huh! They used
to be a lot cheaper.
140009	Really? I had no idea.|Aww	 I want cheap burgers.
140010	Well	 I guess someone your age
wouldn't know any different.
Another sign of the times...
140011	Do people still have pen pals?
140012	Do you even know what
I'm talking about?
140013	Emailing friends...?|Yeah	 sorta.
140014	I guess it's all about social
media these days. Nobody sends
friends emails anymore	 right?
140015	How would you
abbreviate that I wonder...
Socmed pals, maybe?
140016	But we're neighbors first and
foremost	 so here's to years
of good memories to come!
140017	Know what a phone charm is?
140018	People would attach a bunch
of them to their flip phones.
140019	I found a ton of unopened ones
when I was cleaning out
my closet.
140020	I used to be a serious collector.
140021	But you don't really see them
dangling from people's phones
these days	 do you?
140022	{NAME2}-chan	 if you had one	
what would you do with it?
140023	Put it on my phone case.|Attach it to something else.
140024	Oh	 really!? Phew	 maybe I'll
do the same	 then.
140025	Good idea. They're retro	
but still cute. I'll find
somewhere else to put them.
140026	I'm glad I came to you
for advice. Thank you!
140027	Oh	 and did you eat today?
Make sure you're eating
well-balanced meals	 okay?
140028	Wow	 so photo booths are still
a thing!? Do you know about
these	 {NAME2}-chan?
140029	I passed by an arcade and saw
one when I peeked inside.
140030	I passed by an arcade and saw
one when I peeked inside.
140031	They're so much bigger than
the ones I remember using.
140032	I couldn't help but feel
a little nostalgic.
140033	You didn't take any pics?|We should go to one together.
140034	I thought about it	 but
I was on my own.
140035	Maybe I'll take my hubby
on a date	 and we can go
to one together next time.
140036	Thank yooouuu! I'd feel much
more comfortable using one
with someone younger with me.
140037	Oh	 but I do want to go
with my hubby first...
140038	Oooh	 I'm so excited!
140039	I wonder if they still
have codes that unlock
secret frames...
140040	Secret frames?|Codes?
140041	Oh	 I guess they're a little
old-school.
140042	You should go ask your mom
if you don't know what I'm
talking about.
140043	I got a new smartphone!
140044	Learning how to use it took
some time	 but these modern
phones are amazing	 huh?
140045	The cameras are way better
than the digital cameras
we had back in the day.
140046	They really have an app
for everything now	 too.
I can't believe it!
140047	I have no idea what
apps are worth having.
There's too many...
140048	Are there any you
would recommend	
{NAME2}-chan?
140049	Maybe an e-reader app?|Put some games on it.
140050	Oh	 great idea. Apparently
you can even read magazines
on your phone now!
140051	The words are so small
and hard to read though...
Is it time I got glasses?
140052	Ahh	 you can't go wrong with
games. They're perfect for
killing time!
140053	There's so many of them	
though... I wonder if there
are any good ones.
140054	Whatever	 I'll just try some
and find out! Thank you!
140055	{NAME2}-chan!
You won't believe it!
140056	There's a huge sale at the
supermarket right now!
140057	It's not the closest one	
but they're selling cartons
of eggs for 99 yen!
140058	Find some time to go	
it'd be such a waste to let
this chance pass you by!
140059	I dunno	 that seems kinda far.|The convenience store's close.
140060	Whaaat!? No	 but this is about
getting a good deal!
140061	Being a housewife is all about
buying the best thing possible
at the cheapest price.
140062	Ah	 but I guess you
aren't a housewife...
140063	But it's not like you have all
the money in the world	 right?
140064	The savings aren't that much.|Getting there costs money too.
140065	I see. Yeah	 now that you
mention it	 you might
be right.
140066	So that's how kids these days
think about things...
140067	Huh	 okay! I learned
something today. Thanks	
{NAME2}-chan!
140068	Seems like you and Leo-chan
are getting along well	 hm?
140069	Your name comes up all the
time lately when we talk.
140070	Well	 we are close in age.|We're both guys	 so...
140071	Oh	 sure. Yeah	 I guess that
makes sense.
140072	I hope you two keep on
getting along!
140073	What are you	 his mom?|We don't need babysitting...
140074	The thing about being a mom is
that you start worrying over
kids who aren't yours	 too.
140075	It's easy to go overboard
without realizing.
140076	Making sure you give
a youngster the space
they need is hard...
140077	Of course	 it's always easy to
talk to you because you're so
mature	 {NAME2}-chan.
140078	Anyway	 I hope you continue
to keep in touch with both me
and Leo-chan	 okay?
140079	Modern photo booths amaze me!
140080	They even adjust the size
of your eyes and the length
of your legs now!
140081	They're nothing like
the booths we had when
I was growing up.
140082	Take any good pictures?|Use any good filters?
140083	They came out perfect!
I took them with my hubby!
140084	I look so young it's like I'm
back in high school again!
140085	Oooh	 so that's what
they're called! Filters!
140086	Yeah	 I went wild with them!
It's like I was a high school
girl again!
140087	I dunno about my skin	 though.
It made mine almost a bit
too pale	 know what I mean?
140088	I used to put fake tan on all
the time back in high school.
140089	I'd look just like the old me
if they'd let me adjust the
makeup and skin a little...
140090	Wouldn't it be great if there
was a photo booth that let
you look all nice and tan?
140091	What do kids these days even
do with the pictures they
take at photo booths anyway?
140092	Taking pics with my hubby
was fun	 but I don't have
anywhere to display them.
140093	What would you stick
your photos to	
{NAME2}-chan?
140094	Right on my phone case.|My notebooks or my planner.
140095	Oh	 of course! Your phone
case! Yeah	 that does seem
like the trend these days.
140096	So I guess things haven't
changed. Okay	 onto my
budget planner they go!
140097	This reminds me a lot
of what we used to do
when I was at school!
140098	We'd stick them all over these
special photo albums we bought
or trade them with each other.
140099	Some of us would even hide
photos of our crush inside
our phone's battery case.
140100	Ohmigosh	 this takes me back!
It's like I've actually turned
back the clock or something.
140101	Now I want to take even
more photos	 y'know?
140102	Let's take some pics
together sometime	 okay	
{NAME2}-chan?
140103	Are your parents still on that
trip	 {NAME2}-chan?
140104	I'm alone for a while	 yeah.|Yup. They're such lovebirds.
140105	Oh? So I was right.
140106	It's great that they get along
so well	 but it must be
tough on you	 {NAME2}-chan.
140107	My hubby left on a work trip
today too. I'm all alone.
140108	It's not for long	 but our
place just feels so big when
it's just me	 you know?
140109	Don't you ever get lonely
living by yourself?
140110	It's fun!|I'm fine	 I have friends.
140111	Yeah	 I guess you are a
student. Not having your folks
around must have its perks.
140112	Maybe I'll try reaching out
to some friends from my
student days for a change.
140113	Might as well make the most
of having the whole house
to yourself	 right?
140114	It's amazing that you're
able to live alone at
such a young age.
140115	It can't be easy	 right?
140116	I'm just living my life.|You really think so?
140117	My hubby's still out
on his work trip	 so...
140118	I start slacking with
the housework when
I'm by myself.
140119	I barely put any effort into
making dinner	 and my cleaning
gets pretty sloppy too.
140120	What about you? Do you clean?
Are you making sure to eat?
140121	I've got it covered.|Who are you	 my mom?
140122	Well	 someone has it
figured out! I could learn
from your example.
140123	Oh	 sorry! I'm the one who's
falling short here	 I know.
140124	Staying on top of everything
when it's just you is tougher
than I imagined.
140125	Let's both give solo life
everything we've got	 ok?
140126	I know it's a little late	
but thank you for helping
out Leo-chan.
140127	I know a lot happened with
him	 but things seem to have
worked out.
140128	It might have grown into
a whole other issue
if you weren't around.
140129	It was nothing	 really.|I'm glad I could help.
140130	You're sooo mature! Are you
sure you're still just in high
school	 {NAME2}-chan?
140131	It feels like you're clearly
older than me in spirit.
140132	I'd always thought you
were just a regular kid
in the neighborhood...
140133	What kind of experiences
do you need to go through to
end up as mature as you?
140134	Night shifts	 you know?|Sorry	 I can't divulge that.
140135	Oh	 you! Always telling jokes	
{NAME2}-chan!
140136	Well	 I can say for sure that
you'd never do anything bad.
140137	I understand wanting to
act like a bad boy	 though.
In fact	 it's a relief!
140138	I'm just glad to see
you do act your age
every now and then.
140139	You're like the opposite of
me	 in that maybe you could
be a little more childish.
140140	I assume you heard from
Leo-chan already	 but he's
going to be leaving.
140141	I've been helping him
pack his things.
140142	Having to see a kid off is
so sad! It was the same
with my own son.
140143	It reminds me of when I
was younger and finally
leaving home.
140144	I wonder if my parents felt
the same way I do now.
140145	Things have come full circle.|History repeats itself.
140146	That's exactly it! Children
never really get how much their
parents love them.
140147	Of course	 parents are never
able to fully understand how
their children feel either...
140148	Maybe it's the same endless
cycle regardless of age.
140149	If that's the case	 I should
just suck it up and accept it.
140150	That's what it means to
be the one having to watch
a young one leave the nest.
140151	Oh	 I'm being a bit of a
wet blanket now	 aren't I?
Sorry	 forget I said anything!
140152	Going back over and reading
that is making me feel
kind of embarrassed...
140153	Is there any way to delete it?
Oh	 I hate how all this stuff
stays on your phone!
140154	Do you have any hobbies	
{NAME2}-chan?
140155	I like arts and crafts.|I make a pretty mean omelette.
140156	That's right	 you bought
a desk	 didn't you? You must
like handiwork? Cool!
140157	Ooh	 I'd really like to try
your cooking some time.
140158	I have a lot of free time
these days when my hubby
is off at work.
140159	And Leo-chan's going to be
off doing his own thing
soon too...
140160	So I was thinking about taking
up some kind of hobby myself.
140161	But I just can't find one
that feels right for me.
140162	Have any high school hobbies?|You should try something new.
140163	Well... Yeah	 there's some
stuff that I don't do anymore.
140164	I don't know if I'd call them
hobbies	 though. More like
dreams or ambitions.
140165	Something I've never tried
before	 hm? I wonder what
that could be.
140166	Though there are some things
I've felt like wanting to do
one day!
140167	You know	 I think I'm
starting to get some idea
of what I could try!
140168	Thanks	 {NAME2}-chan!
I'll message you again later.
140169	Hey	 so have you been wearing
the clothes I gave you?
140170	All the time.|I treasure them.
140171	That's greeeat! I'm so happy.
Those are actually pretty
nice pieces	 you know.
140172	Believe it or not	 I used to
work in fashion.
140173	I've been a housewife for
a while now after meeting
my hubby	 of course.
140174	But maybe this means that
I still have a sharp eye
when it comes to looks?
140175	Ooh	 maybe I should become
your full-time stylist next!
140176	You'd be doing me a favor!|I dunno about that...
140177	Really? I was expecting you
to say no! Aww	 I'm so happy!
Just leave it to me!
140178	Hahaha! Hey	 I was
just kidding	 you know!
You're such a cutie!
140179	I'll find some new clothes
for you	 then. Something to
look forward to!
140180	I can't stop scrolling
through online videos
when I'm bored...
140181	It's like time just melts away
the minute I'm watching vids
of other peoples' pets!
140182	Would you consider yourself
a dog person or a cat person	
{NAME2}-chan?
140183	Can't beat a dog's loyalty.|I prefer cats.
140184	I know	 right? They're so
floofy and cute!
140185	I love petting animals	
but caring for one is so
much work	 you know?
140186	You don't have any pets
at home	 do you?
140187	I have an owl	 actually.|Just some plants.
140188	Ooh	 how mysterious!
I'm actually pretty jealous.
140189	You're kidding though...
right? You know you shouldn't
tease your elders!
140190	We're talking about pets here!
I suppose you do still have to
raise them	 but still...
140191	Of course	 you'd never be able
to care for an animal if you
can't even care for plants.
140192	Aww	 I want a pet so badly!
140193	Might grow some plants...
140194	But I'm not sure what I
should get. Do you have
any suggestions?
140195	How about potted flowers?|Could grow some veggies?
140196	That sounds wonderful!
All that color	 right outside
my window!
140197	Ooh	 I like it!
I bet it'd even help
spruce up dinner!
140198	Raising a child was so much
work. I was relieved when
it was over	 but...
140199	Well	 seems like my desire to
look after something hasn't
completely gone away.
140200	That's probably why I tend to
be a bit too watchful when it
comes to you.
140201	Thanks for always putting up
with me. I hope I'm not
annoying you.
140202	I'm grateful for it.|You can be a handful.
140203	I'm so glad to hear you
say that! Well	 then here's
to even more meddling!
140204	Oops	 so I guess you were
the one looking after me?
140205	Well	 either way. Thanks for
all the advice! I'll message
you again later	 okay?
140210	Error: tnxotb-[140210]
140211	Error: tnxotb-[140211]
140212	Error: tnxotb-[140212]
140213	Error: tnxotb-[140213]
140214	Error: tnxotb-[140214]
140300	Sorry for the sudden text.
Do you have a second?
140301	Kayo-san's been asking you for
advice on all kinds of stuff	
right?
140302	I was wondering if I could ask
you for some advice myself.
140303	Sorry. I know this is totally
coming out of nowhere...
140304	Okay	 sure.|If you must.
140305	Thanks.
140306	This might take a while. Could
we meet outside in a bit?
140500	Oh	 {NAME2}-chan!
Are you free?
140501	Would you like to hang out?
I'd love to learn what teens
are into these days.
140502	Fine by me.|Today's kinda busy	 actually.
140503	Great! I know this is sudden	
but are you able to come over
now?
140504	That's fine	 no pressure.
If you happen to have time	
you know where I am.
140505	Really? That's too bad. Maybe when
you have some time	 okay?
140600	Hey	 {NAME2}-chan	
there's something that's
been on my mind lately...
140601	I was wondering if we could
meet up and I could talk
to you about it.
140602	No problem.|Lemme get back to you.
140603	Great! I know this is sudden	
but are you able to come over
now?
140604	That's okay	 just when you
have time. I'm sure you're
busy with other things	 too.
140605	Hey! You free right now?
150000	Leek	 dried sardines	
bonito	 kelp	 garlic	
ginger	 celery.
150001	What's this recipe for?|Is this a shopping list?
150002	Oh. My bad.
150003	Wrong person.
150004	Meant to send it to my mom.
150005	How do you deal
with heartburn?
150006	The ramen I just had went
heavy on the fat.
150007	Go to the drugstore.|Try the convenience store.
150008	Ah	 good idea. Hope they
have somethin'.
150009	Thanks. I'll return the
favor sometime.
150010	Mind if I ask you something?
150011	You like your ramen
light or heavy?
150012	Light.|Heavy.
150013	Cool. Good to know.
150014	I like to keep up-to-date with
what customers like. Ttyl.
150015	You know the origin
of the word "soy"?
150016	Like	 soybeans?|Your code name?
150017	Yeah	 that.
150018	Nah	 I mean regular soybeans.
150019	I was looking it up earlier.
150020	Apparently	 it comes from
the Japanese word "shoyu".
150021	They brought it to Europe as
soya in the 17th century.
150022	That became soy in English.
It's why we call 'em soybeans.
150023	Basically	 soy is a
Japanese loanword.
150024	Kinda weird	 right?
150025	Just felt like sharing that.
Anyway	 catch ya soon.
150026	Noodles count as a
staple food	 yeah?
150027	Sure.|Wouldn't call it a side dish.
150028	Right? Glad you agree.
150029	Ask anyone else and they'd
only bring up rice and bread.
150030	I say it's fine to have
noodles for all three meals.
150031	Why don't more people do that?
150032	You'd get tired of it.|Some countries do.
150033	Huh	 yeah. I can
understand that.
150034	Depends on where you live	
huh. Like	 pasta in Italy.
150035	It makes sense now. Thanks.
150036	I told my mom about you
at dinner today.
150037	She was shocked.
150038	Said it's been forever since I
talked about a classmate.
150039	Don't talk about school much?|What do you discuss?
150040	When I was workin'	
I'd bring up customers
and coworkers.
150041	Normally	 I just sit and
let her talk my ear off.
150042	Right... I guess that
makes sense.
150043	Feels like it's been forever
since I brought up a friend.
150044	Lately	 my mom's been
asking about you.
150045	What did you tell her?|Because we're friends?
150046	You know	 what we've eaten
and where we've gone.
150047	Nothin' out of the ordinary.
150048	Do moms really want to know
about this stuff?
150049	The other day	 she even asked
me to bring you along.
150050	I'd like to visit.|Sounds fun.
150051	My mom's on the night shift	
so she might not be around.
150052	My place is nothing special	
but if you really want to...
150053	Come by whenever.
150054	What dish would you choose to
end a yakiniku course on?
150055	Cold noodles.|Ramen.
150056	Good call. Can't go wrong
with that.
150057	Kinda strange	 really.
I'd eat all that meat...
150058	And still have room
for noodles.
150059	Ever tried rice?|Don't forget the dessert.
150060	Yeah	 I guess some stores
finish off with rice soup.
150061	Sure	 can't go wrong with
ice cream or almond jelly.
150062	They all go down smoothly.
150063	I guess that's what
matters most.
150064	Remember what I told you
about the word "soy"?
150065	Japanese loanword	 right?|Of course.
150066	Turns out there are
loads of them.
150067	Like with the Sahara Desert	
Sahara just means desert.
150068	Hula means "dance"	 and
salsa means "sauce".
150069	The "Erimo" in Cape Erimo
means "cape" in Ainu.
150070	It's surprising how there's
so much more to common words
than we think	 right?
150071	I'm amazed by your knowledge.|How about "naan bread"?
150072	It's fun to look this
stuff up	 you know?
150073	Yeah	 that's another one!
There must be more.
150074	Lemme know if you
find more	 yeah?
150075	Hey	 remember our soy talk?
150076	About the sauce?|That stuff on etymology?
150077	Yeah	 I'm talkin' about food.
150078	Yeah. I've been looking
into it more.
150079	A lot of words related to
foods and seasonings
tend to double up.
150080	It happens when foreign foods
are introduced to a country	
and locals adapt the flavors.
150081	It's interesting to see things
from that point of view.
150082	You sure like to study.|Does this help you cook?
150083	I get excited thinking about
how it'll make my food better.
I just can't stop.
150084	It's giving me too many ideas.
I want to try out everything.
150085	I should be able to cook up
something interesting.
150086	I tried some ramen at this
run-down Chinese restaurant.
150087	The noodles and soup
were nothing special.
150088	But their roasted pork slices
really stood out.
150089	The old man who ran
the place told me how
to make the marinade.
150090	But I just can't
get it right...
150091	How does he do it?
150092	I can't believe it.|Was it that good?
150093	Yeah	 makes no sense. He just
seemed to dump everything in a
bowl and serve it up. So...
150094	Hey	 can't blame me for being
curious. When it comes to
flavors	 I'm always serious...
150095	Wait.
150096	Maybe it's about not
trying too hard. Is that
why it's good?
150097	I need to try this out.
150098	I'll throw the sugar in
half at a time.
150099	The second time	 I won't let
it dissolve completely.
150100	That's how you get the
marinade to taste so good.
150101	What are you talking about?|Random.
150102	It's the roasted pork recipe
I mentioned before.
150103	The uneven distribution
of flavor is what made it
so delicious.
150104	Talkin' to you made me realize
that all this time	 all I had
to do was just wing it.
150105	You figured it out.|When're you making me some?
150106	If I didn't talk it out with
you	 I'd still be struggling.
150107	The roast pork?
Whenever you want.
150108	I'll make the best bowl of
ramen to go with this pork.
150109	You know	 the first guy to
try out fermented food...
150110	Either they were hella brave	
or incredibly desperate.
150111	I wonder which.
150112	I vote courage.|Hunger is the best spice.
150113	Yeah	 I agree.
That takes guts of steel.
150114	Lucky for the guy	 it turned
out to be delicious and had
a great shelf life.
150115	People still ferment stuff.
Hell	 we're getting better
at it.
150116	To think someone sealed away
the right food for a while and
invented a tasty snack... Wow!
150117	It made a huge impact	 huh?|Sounds unreal.
150118	That's exactly why fermented
foods are cool	 if you ask me.
150119	I knew that you'd understand.
150120	I tried making my own homemade
seasoned bamboo shoots.
150121	If I'm happy with them	
I'll let you try some.
150122	Damn it...
150123	Those bamboo shoots I made
the other day...
150124	They didn't work out?|Hey	 it happens.
150125	Nah.
150126	They're perfect.
150127	Turned out better than I ever
thought they would.
150128	Issue is	 my mom moved them
around a bunch.
150129	I don't know how she did it.
Why'd they turn out so well?
150130	Time to experiment.|The wonders of fermentation.
150131	Yeah. I'll nail this taste
down	 all right.
150132	Right... I guess I'll start by
uncovering its mystery.
150133	I'll get back to you when
I figure it out.
150134	Met Pops the other day.
It's been forever.
150135	I had him try the best bowl
of ramen I could make.
150136	How did it go?|What did he say?
150137	He praised me like
never before.
150138	And when he was done...
150139	He told me...
150140	What matters is
what comes next.
150141	What does that mean?|You have a ways to go?
150142	The best bowl is just
a means to an end.
150143	I guess	 yeah.
150144	I don't know yet what
truly matters.
150145	But I know that talking to you
helps me sort out how I feel.
150146	If you don't mind	
I hope you'll keep
lending me an ear.
150147	Leave it to me	 partner.|Only if you pay.
150148	Heh	 thanks.
150149	I've been thinking about
stuff. Mind hearing me out?
150150	Sure.|Tell me.
150151	Imagine two bowls of ramen	
one's perfect	 one's not.
150152	Pops says the latter is
just right.
150153	Why's that?|Sounds wise.
150154	If I want my customers to be
truly satisfied...
150155	They must be the ones
to decide how to enjoy
their meal.
150156	Yeah	 it's not about forcing
my best onto the customers.
150157	I've gotta let them decide
on their own what's best.
150158	Or at least	 I think so.
150159	I've never owned my own store	
so I'm not sure.
150160	I feel more confident talking
it out with you though.
150161	I'm just listening.|Got your thoughts sorted?
150162	Yeah	 thanks.
150163	Hey	 {NAME2}.
You got a moment?
150164	There's something bothering
me	 I guess...
150165	I'm all ears.|What's up?
150166	There are so many flavors and
recipes I want to try out.
150167	But that might not be what
the customer wants.
150168	If that's that case	 then...
150169	What's the point of searching
for my own flavor?
150170	Shouldn't I just make what
the customers want to eat?
150171	That's what I'm wondering.
150172	Don't forget your goal.|What do you want to do?
150173	My goal... Yeah	 you're right.
150174	I lost myself for a bit.
150175	I want to create the best
flavor experience I can
for my customers.
150176	Huh? What was I
so worried about?
150177	You're a lifesaver. I mean it.
Thanks	 man.
150178	Spoke to a guy from class...
150179	He laughed and said I was
surprisingly friendly.
150180	Surprisingly? What did he
mean by that?
150181	Contrary to expectations.|Well	 you come off as serious.
150182	Hey! No one asked for
a walking dictionary.
150183	Huh	 you might be right.
150184	I've never been all that great
at talking to others.
150185	That's why he was
so surprised	 huh.
150186	It's fun talking with you.|Maybe you've changed.
150187	Yeah... Glad to hear that	
but you're making me blush.
150188	If I have	 it's thanks to you.
150189	Anyway	 see ya!
150500	Hey	 you free right now?
150501	I'm off to try somethin' new
to develop my palate.
Wanna tag along?
150502	No problem.|Lemme get back to you.
150503	Cool. Let's get going then.
150504	Gotcha. Maybe some other time.
150505	Okay	 see you around.
150600	Hey	 you busy?
There's something
I gotta ask you.
150601	Can I use your kitchen?
150602	Uh	 okay.|It's kinda short notice...
150603	Hang on. I'd better explain
the situation first.
150604	I can fill you in more at my
usual spot	 so meet me there.
150605	I don't mean like right now.
I'll be at my usual spot	 so
come by if you've got time.
160000	Hey	 {NAME1}-san	
are you good at
waking up early?
160001	Sure...|Well	 I'm never late...
160002	The telltale signs of
an oversleeper. But hey	
that's why we're friends.
160003	I usually feel super groggy
in the morning.
160004	So I need a cup of tea
to force my gears to
start turning.
160005	Hey Sensei	 do you read
autobiographical manga?
160006	Can't get enough.|If I'm super bored.
160007	Ahaha	 those things're mostly
fluff	 don't ya think?
160008	Still	 when it comes to
talking about nothing	
160009	Japanese authors have always
been good at making the
mundane sound so interesting.
160010	I always give new teas a try
when I spot them in the
convenience store.
160011	You don't see any sweetened
green teas in Japan	 now that
I think about it.
160012	Would you ever
give it a try	 Sensei?
160013	I dunno...|Sounds interesting.
160014	Mint tea is lovely in the
warmer months	 you know.
160015	Wasn't sure what they meant
by authentic Chinese food
the first time I heard it.
160016	But it basically means
the real deal! Not the dishes
tweaked for Japanese palates.
160017	It's been getting real popular
these days. Want to go try
some together next time?
160018	I'm kind of curious now.|Does authentic mean spicy?
160019	That's the spirit	 Sensei!
It'll be a great experience	
for sure.
160020	The ingredients and seasonings
are a bit different from
Chinese food here in Japan.
160021	Not everything is spicy	
you know! Different regions
have their own flavors.
160022	Though I am a Sichuan girl.
That tongue-numbing heat
is right up my alley.
160023	I'll see if I can find any
good restaurants nearby.
160024	Consider it my way of saying
thanks for all the things
you teach me!
160025	I realized something super
important when I spoke with
some school friends today.
160026	I need to try raw egg
over rice!
160027	There are all sorts of egg
dishes where I come from.
160028	But I would have never even
considered eating it the way
they serve it here—raw.
160029	What about you	 Sensei?
Do you eat a lot of
raw egg with rice?
160030	I guess?|Like it's my job.
160031	Oh-ho! I thought so.
160032	So... it's that tasty	 huh.
160033	The eggs they sell in this
country are safe to eat raw.
160034	When in Japan	 do as
the Japanese do	 right!?
160035	I know Chinese and
Japanese supermarkets
sell different stuff.
160036	But man	 I couldn't believe
how many bath salts
they stock in this country!
160037	Aroma this	
hot spring minerals that	
you name it.
160038	What sorta bath salts
do you like	 Sensei?
160039	Colorful ones.|Only the best quality.
160040	Ooh	 I could see how
a bright	 fragrant bath
could lift your mood.
160041	Me	 I'd go for anything that
keeps me moisturized.
160042	Speaking of which	 Japan is
chock-full of hot springs.
160043	Ones that make your
skin smooth	 improve
circulation	 etc.
160044	If it's all true	 that'd be
pretty incredible	
don't you think?
160045	Heck	 I might have to give
some of these salts a shot.
160046	I'll buy a whole bunch
and see for myself!
160047	Walking around the city
made me realize something...
160048	Japan sure loves its vending
machines	 doesn't it?
160049	In places with convenience
stores around practically
every corner...
160050	I don't see much of a point
to all these machines.
160051	They're even more convenient!|They're easy to use.
160052	Hmm... Is that it?
Not sure if I agree.
160053	Japanese people have a
reputation for being polite	
and I think so too.
160054	But maybe people just want to
get things done without the
fuss of talking with anyone?
160055	That's deep.|You think so?
160056	Uh	 I guess I still don't
completely get it.
160057	Oh	 it was just a thought.
Maybe I'm totally
off the mark.
160058	Guess I said something
a little weird	 huh.
I'll mull it over a bit more.
160059	Did you know some Japanese
words exist in Chinese too	
but have different meanings?
160060	It's a little confusing	 but I
find it real interesting.
160061	Like what?|Lay a good one on me.
160062	Let's see. Well	 the word for
study in Japanese can mean
reluctance in Chinese.
160063	It's a pretty interesting
connection	 don't you think?
160064	It made me wonder whether that
nuance exists in Japanese too.
160065	If so	 then maybe Japanese
people have always been
reluctant to hit the books...
160066	Totally relatable	
if you ask me.
160067	I see.|Same here.
160068	Who knows	 it might've been
a joke the first time someone
said it.
160069	Although you gotta agree
that this is an absolute gem
of a find. Haha.
160070	I use my computer to keep
in touch with Mama.
160071	I always struggle to come up
with an answer when she asks
me how university's going.
160072	I'm making the most of my time
here in Japan	 but sometimes
my studies take a back seat...
160073	That counts as studying!|There's more important things.
160074	Yeah	 I could just say
I'm studying by living
everyday life!
160075	Right... yeah. There is
something that I've been
mulling over.
160076	And that's what kind of person
I want to become.
160077	It would've been better if I'd
figured this all out before
I came to study	 sure.
160078	But as they say	 you'll never
know unless you try.
160079	I feel better after talking
to you	 Sensei.
160080	Now I can face my Mama
with pride	 and tell her
my studies are going A-OK!
160081	Papa was the one who insisted
I study abroad...
160082	but I haven't talked to him
much since I got here.
160083	I appreciate the space	
but I admit it does
bother me a bit.
160084	Maybe he's taking a back seat?|He respects your independence?
160085	Don't tell me that he's
secretly expecting more
from me than Mama!
160086	Aww geez	 I'd take the
constant nagging any day
over a ticking time bomb!
160087	In other words	 they've put
their faith in me?
160088	Aww geez... Somehow that
feels even heavier	 y'know?
160089	At any rate	 the fact that
I have to show good results
hasn't changed a bit.
160090	I'm the one who'll be
in trouble if I don't	
after all.
160091	Better put my nose to the
grindstone	 as they say...
160092	Welp	 wish me luck	 Sensei!
160093	In one of my lectures	 I heard
that the Chinese first arrived
in Japan centuries ago.
160094	There was even a Chinese
settlement in the Hakata ward
of Kyushu 1000 years ago!
160095	Pretty amazing	 huh?
160096	Around the same time	
Japanese people from the
Goto Islands in Nagasaki...
160097	would travel to and from China
on the regular.
160098	Not exactly next door
neighbors	 when you
think about it.
160099	That's why I can't help but
find it so incredible.
160100	I'd love to go check out
Hakata and the Goto Islands
sometime!
160101	That'd be quite the trip.|Both would be no mean feat.
160102	Oh yeah	 I heard riding the
train all the way to Hakata
is brutal on the ole keister.
160103	Then it's a whole other flight
or boat ride to the islands...
160104	You'd have to catch a flight
to get from Hakata to
the islands	 right?
160105	So doing it all in one trip
wouldn't be much different
to two trips. Hmm...
160106	I thought about it
on my travels...
160107	They have Chinatowns not only
in Yokohama	 but Kobe and
Nagasaki	 too.
160108	I'd love to check them out
sometime. It'd be a whole lot
easier than going to Hakata.
160109	No doubt.|Totally.
160110	I've heard of people from my
homeland who made the trek to
Japan in search of something.
160111	I really wanna know exactly
what it is they came for.
160112	For sure. I'm still trying to
figure out what it is I want.
160113	I figured maybe they could
give me a few hints.
160114	Not sure. There's so much
more I need to learn about
this country.
160115	Including what others saw in
choosing to settle here.
160116	Adults are always telling us
to watch our language
and stuff.
160117	Don't say things that could
ruffle people's feathers	
they say.
160118	Japan takes that to a whole
other level.
160119	If I'm being honest	 I'm not
good at holding my tongue...
160120	I can't help but bite back
when someone disagrees
with me.
160121	Anyone would feel the same.|It's a matter of restraint.
160122	You're the same	 huh	 Sensei?
Getting all riled up...
160123	What's most important
is how you act after
all's said and done.
160124	You're right. I'm sure that's
what I'm lacking.
160125	Just venting your feelings
won't help anything.
160126	I kind of get it now.
160127	I'm not the only one out there
with a short fuse	 huh?
160128	Gotta say	 that's a relief
to hear	 Sensei. Thanks!
160129	Backtracking a bit...
160130	I'm well aware that I have
trouble speaking kindly
or subtly.
160131	Especially when I have
something super important
to say.
160132	My impulse to speak my mind
takes the wheel.
160133	That's okay for now.|Focus on conveying your thoughts.
160134	Not only do I talk straight	
but I don't care what
people think of me.
160135	I only worry about whether
or not they're picking up
what I'm putting down.
160136	I don't have that problem with
you though	 do I	 Sensei?
160137	The way you say something
is important	 of course.
160138	I wish I could say things the
best way possible—or at least
be nice about it.
160139	But if I hold back	 and
end up failing to convey
what I want to	 well...
160140	Yep	 I'd definitely regret it.
For sure.
160141	That's one worry down for
ole Yaoling. Thanks a bunch!
160142	If speaking my mind
makes someone hate me	
then I'll be the bad guy.
160143	That's how I used
to think	 anyway.
160144	The only thing that mattered
to me was...
160145	Where I'll land when
the dust settles.
160146	In other words	 I wasn't
seriously considering the
person I was talking to.
160147	Where's this coming from?|That's pretty heavy.
160148	It took being on the receiving
end of it to finally realize
what I was doing.
160149	There's no point in playing
the blame game.
160150	That's the same thing as
giving up and running from
the conversation.
160151	Yeah	 my bad. But when I think
about it seriously—and I mean
really seriously...
160152	I'm finally learning how
lackadaisical I can be.
160153	When you're really trying to
fix a problem	 whose fault
it is doesn't matter.
160154	It's like you say	 Sensei.
This has been a good
learning experience for me.
160155	Geez	 all this stuff has gone
to show me just how childish
I can be.
160156	Look at me	 forcing my own
opinions onto others...
160157	It won't get them any closer
to understanding where
I'm coming from.
160158	Denying it was my fault. I was
just trying to make excuses
to cover up for myself.
160159	One step closer to adulthood.|Empathy is important.
160160	Right. You can't grow up if
all you care about is whether
or not you think it's fair.
160161	Exactly. Focusing on what's
right or wrong isn't enough.
160162	This whole thing with
Yukimi-san...
160163	I feel like I made things
pretty awkward...
160164	but I'm happy to say
I've wiped the whole thing
from my brain box.
160165	Glad to hear it.|As long as you learn from it.
160166	Ha ha	 I thought you'd
say that! And honestly	
I really needed to hear it.
160167	I got mad and sad.
Dragged you here
and there	 Sensei...
160168	Yeah	 I sure got taught
a valuable lesson.
160169	I never thought I'd end up
thinking this way.
160170	I couldn't forget what
I've learned here	
even if I wanted to.
160171	I'm still in the middle
of my studies...
160172	So I imagine I've got plenty
of cringey moments ahead
of me—and failures	 to boot.
160173	But instead of beating
myself up and backing off...
160174	I'd rather forge on ahead and
embrace the embarrassment.
160175	That way	 I sure won't forget
what I've learned.
160176	Sounds good to me!|Just take it slow	 okay?
160177	It's reassuring to hear you
say that	 Sensei!
160178	I might make my fair share
of messes going forward.
160179	I guess it's weird to say I'm
looking forward to it	 but	
uh	 I actually kind of am!
160180	That's random.|What're you talking about?
160181	Do you see yourself in them?|Do you want to live here?
160200	I'm still in the middle
of my studies.
160201	I have to write this report
for uni...
160202	...and I'd like you to
check it to make sure
my Japanese is correct!
160203	I'm at the diner right now	
so if you're free	 I could
really use your help!
160500	Hey	 Sensei!
Got some free time today?
160501	I wanna learn more about Japan	 so I'm out
exploring today. Wanna come with?
160502	Sounds fun.|I'm kinda busy.
160503	Awesome! I'm looking forward
to learning a lot from you!
160504	Too bad	 but no worries. Let's go some
other time	 okay?
160505	Let me know when you've
got some time!
160600	Hey	 Sensei	 umm...
Do you have time today?
160601	There's something
I would really appreciate
your help with.
160602	I'm all ears.|I'll have to get back to you.
160603	Thank you! Sorry this
is so short notice...
160604	I'll meet you at the usual
place in Yongen-Jaya!
160605	That's all right	 it doesn't
need to be now. Just when
you have time	 Sensei.
170000	Hello! It's me! Yui!
170001	Hello!|You surprised me.
170002	I was getting lonely
only talking to you
in that world.
170003	So let's chat via IMs
from time to time
as well!
170004	Later!
170005	What's the shortest season
of the year? Take a guess!
170006	Summer?|Winter?
170007	Nope! It's Fall.
Only four letters!
170008	Better luck next time!
170009	Thanks for replying though!
I was so terribly bored!
170010	I'm bored out of my mind.
Tell me a joke!
170011	I need time to prepare.|I'm bad with jokes.
170012	Is that right?
170013	Then I guess I'll have to
come up with something
next time!
170014	Good day to you!
170015	Do you have a favorite fruit?
170016	Apples.|Mandarins.
170017	Apples grow in cold climates.
The greater the difference in
temp between day and night	
170018	the sweeter and redder
the fruits!
170019	On the other hand	 mandarins
grow well in warm climates!
170020	Mandarins prefer
warmer climates.
170021	I heard that stable
temperatures produce
sourer fruit.
170022	Apples	 however	
grow well when cold!
170023	They may both be fruits	
but their needs are different!
170024	Isn't the world of
horticulture just so
deep and fascinating!
170025	I'm getting more excited
by the minute!
170026	Guess what Musubi told me!
170027	She said you're a
high schooler	 Russet!
170028	Are you a model student?
170029	I guess.|Not really.
170030	My	 you sound confident!
170031	You're really something!
170032	I was concerned that you might
not log on during exam season.
170033	But it seems I was worrying
for nothing!
170034	Oh my...
170035	Then you might not log on much
during exams.
170036	You really ought to prioritize
your studies.
170037	Don't go neglecting your
grades for our farm!
170038	Sorry for suddenly logging out
last time.
170039	I don't think I'll be able
to help out for a while.
170040	I just need some time
on my own.
170041	Of course.|Take your time.
170042	Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
170043	So... about what Musubi
said about you being
a high schooler...
170044	You just seem like you've got
everything under control.
170045	Could it be...
170046	I'm the only one who struggles
to keep it cool!?
170047	I have made a full recovery!
170048	I'm going to make up for
all the frustration I've been
made to feel!
170049	Glad to hear it.|Calm down.
170050	You won't have to worry
about me anymore!
170051	There's no turning back!
Behold! The new Yui is here!
170052	Oh yeah!
A lady of class always remains
calm and collected.
170053	Behold! The new Yui
is here	 bursting with
serene tranquility!
170054	Actually	 I guess that's a bit
of an oxymoron...
170055	I'll just stick with Yui.
Plain and simple.
170056	Just watch me!
I don't need a new name to
show you how I've changed!
170057	I do wonder what you think
of the country life...
170058	I admire it.|How's it differ to the city?
170059	Well	 it's definitely not
as convenient.
170060	But it is full of nature	
which is something you don't
tend to see in the city.
170061	It's no surprise that some
people dream of escaping
to the countryside.
170062	Well	 it's very inconvenient
for school kids who don't
have a driver's license!
170063	If you miss the hourly bus	
you'd better be prepared
to get biking!
170064	Then there's all the bugs...
170065	You'll likely meet more
critters than fellow
countryfolk!
170066	There's more where that came
from if you're interested!
170067	Musubi's told me so many
stories about her life
in the countryside!
170068	Where do you usually
do your shopping?
170069	Not virtually	
I mean in real life.
170070	Near my house.|In Shibuya.
170071	Ah	 somewhere nice and close!
170072	I'm the same!
170073	Oooh	 that's where
Musubi works!
170074	I've heard there are tons
of shops there!
170075	That reminds me.
Some of my furniture	
and even tools are broken.
170076	I bought them forever ago.
170077	No wonder they're
all falling apart!
170078	They're no use to me anymore.
I need to buy new ones!
170079	So many things to buy...
170080	'Cause I need a new vacuum
cleaner and a kettle too!
Life is hard.
170081	Do you have any shops
you'd recommend?
170082	Try Akihabara.|Just get 'em online.
170083	I see!
170084	I heard that there are a lot
of electronics stores there!
170085	That's all real world
business	 so I'll ask
Musubi to go!
170086	Great idea!
170087	I don't have to go out	
and I can really take my time
to think and choose!
170088	Hey	 Russet.
170089	Let's go shopping
together sometime!
170090	I'm super curious to learn
more about your taste!
170091	I've been wondering...
170092	When we first met	
what did you think of me?
170093	That you were interesting.|Wow	 she's peppy.
170094	That's it?
170095	You didn't think I was
weird or annoying?
170096	If not	 then awesome!
170097	I'm a bit worried...
170098	That you might be forcing
yourself to spend time
with me.
170099	I like spending time with you.|I like you the way you are.
170100	You have no idea how happy
I am to hear that!
170101	Well	 since I asked...
170102	It's only fair if I tell you
what I thought of you	 too!
170103	My first impression
of you was...
170104	That you seem pretty...
absent-minded?
170105	You're not very excitable	 and
you don't talk much either.
170106	Cause you do all the talking.|You're the energetic one.
170107	Oh	 really?
I'm sorry about that.
170108	But my impression of you
has changed!
170109	You may be the quiet type	
but I know there's a lot going
on in that mind of yours.
170110	You're thoughtful
and passionate.
170111	You also have a great
sense of humor.
170112	Perhaps I'm complimenting you
way too much!
170113	Before we harvest the cyber
watermelons	 I have to ask...
170114	Do you eat yours with salt?
170115	Yup.|I don't.
170116	Yaaay!
170117	A long time ago	 I sprinkled
some on a friend's watermelon.
170118	Things got tense between us.
170119	I had no idea that there were
people who prefer it without.
170120	I'm glad I asked!
I like mine with salt.
170121	I'll make sure not to
put any on yours.
170122	It's a good thing I checked
to be sure!
170123	Food grudges can last
an entire lifetime	
you know!
170124	But in my defense...
170125	The salt incident
I mentioned earlier...
170126	It happened back when
I was a wee sprout!
170127	It's not as if I go round
seasoning my coworkers'
lunches at the office!
170128	I'm not that kind of person.
Don't get the wrong idea!
170129	You were once a wee sprout?|You're an office worker?
170130	Of course! Even I was
a child once	 you know.
170131	Just because I'm a resident
of this virtual world...
170132	...it doesn't mean
you don't change.
170133	Th-That's the name of
my old guild! The Office!
170134	We're always discussing food!
170135	Anyway! No surprise pinch
of salt on your watermelon.
170136	You may rest assured!
170137	Hello. Thank you
for the other day.
170138	The basil grew very well.
170139	I cooked with it today!
170140	Who dis?|You've got the wrong number!
170141	Ah	 excuse me!
170142	Actually	 I'm making pasta
with Musubi right now.
170143	She's treating me to dinner!
170144	I guess I'm starting to
pick up her speaking habits...
170145	Pay no mind to
those messages!
170146	P.S.
170147	I recall telling you
some time back
170148	that I can't be in the
same place as Musubi.
170149	So you might be wondering
how we're eating together...
170150	But that rule only applies
to eating out.
170151	Musubi and I can share a meal
since we're at her place!
170152	Oh	 I see!|I forgot that was a thing.
170153	Oh	 you're so pure!
170154	I hope you stay that way!
170155	In that case	 forget about
what I said back then!
170156	Also	 it's not a "thing"
I'll have you know!
170157	In any case	 let us not
worry over such details!
170158	What matters right now is
how good this pasta tastes
with basil!
170159	Is there anything you want to
do besides farming	 Russet?
170160	Within the virtual world	
I mean!
170161	Of course	 if you want to talk
about real life	 I'm all ears!
170162	Let's farm together forever.|I'd like to meet you IRL.
170163	When did you come to enjoy
farming this much?
170164	Well then	 let's focus on
expanding our fields!
170165	Bring it on!
170166	Not here in the virtual world?
170167	I can't do that right now	
I'm afraid.
170168	But I will consider it.
170169	I've been thinking...
170170	Once we recreate my hometown
in the virtual world...
170171	Why don't we do your
neighborhood next?
170172	Good idea.|I can't wait.
170173	We still have a ways to go
before that	 though!
170174	But when the time comes...
170175	I'll have to go see what
your town looks like!
170176	After all	 the best way
to recreate something is
to see it with your own eyes!
170177	I'll be counting on you
to show me around.
170178	It's a promise!
170300	Want to try Harvest World
Online? It's free to play!
170301	Sign up now and get
a free plot of land!
170500	Hello there!
Are you free at the moment?
Cause I sure am!
170501	Allow me to show you
around this world!
170502	That'd be great!|Can't today	 sorry...
170503	Then I'll see you online!
170504	That's too bad.
Maybe another time!
170510	This is a message from
the admin of Harvest
World Online.
170511	There is currently an outbreak
of potato moles! For those
of you with farms	 be careful.
170600	Hey	 I've got a favor to ask	
Russet!
170601	I'd like to visit your room!
170602	...By which I mean your
virtual room	 of course!
170603	Sure	 no problem.|I dunno...
170604	Great! Let me know when you're
all set up!
170605	Ah	 that's too bad.
Well	 lemme if you
change your mind.
300000	{NAME1}-kun?
You free now?
300001	So	 that thing you taught me
the other day... I can't seem
to get it right on my own.
300002	Mind showing me again?
When you have time	 of course!
300003	Sure thing.|Reply later

180000	Hey	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
What kind of mocktail sounds
good right about now?
180001	Something refreshing.|Something sweet.
180002	I see. Thanks!
180003	I'm thinking up some
new recipes	 so this'll help
give me some ideas.
180004	I'll let you try what
I've come up with
next time you're here!
180005	Also	 anything come to mind
that's popular with
high schoolers these days?
180006	I wanna try making
mocktails that appeal
to younger customers.
180007	Watching videos online.|Mobile games.
180008	Cool. I'll see what
I can do...
180009	Thanks so much!
You've been a huge help!
180010	You won't believe this	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
180011	What's wrong?|Did something happen?
180012	Oh	 no	 it's nothing serious.
My body's just aching
all over.
180013	I went a bit too hard with my
flair bartending practice and
now my limbs are killing me...
180014	I wonder if I'll even be able
to work properly tomorrow...
Sorry	 just wanted to vent!
180015	You know how bartending
is a standing job	 right?
180016	But it's worse for me since
I do flair bartending.
180017	So it's even more tiring...
180018	I used to have more stamina
when I was in college...
Probably because I did dance.
180019	You could work out.|Why not dance again?
180020	Like at a gym? I guess	 but I
find it hard to stay motivated
when working out alone...
180021	Hm... Yeah	 maybe.
180022	You do have a point	 though.
I should get in a workout
or two somehow!
180023	I'll give it some thought.
Thanks for hearing me out!
180024	Many of our regulars are
friends with the owner.
180025	They're all old people too.
I'm glad we're getting more
customers younger than me.
180026	Business must be booming.|Makes me feel welcome.
180027	Yup. It means we're getting
more customers. I can't
complain about that!
180028	I'm thinking we should add
more mocktails to the menu.
180029	I hope that attracts more
teenagers like you and
others who can't drink.
180030	I'm sure it will.|I can't wait.
180031	Hehe	 thanks!
180032	I'll think up a bunch of tasty
mocktail recipes!
180033	Recently	 I've been watching
tons of dance videos online.
180034	Some of them only use the
upper body. Maybe I could use
them in my flair bartending.
180035	A lot of them are pretty cute
too with these unique poses.
180036	I think that could work.|I want to see.
180037	Really? I'm glad to hear that.
180038	You know	 I learned
a bunch of different
dances back in college.
180039	There was this one time we had
to perform something right out
of The Arabian Nights.
180040	We all even had to make
matching costumes.
It took a lot of work.
180041	That sounds fun.|I'd like to try.
180042	I might still have some
costumes back home.
I can teach you!
180043	Smartphones are so handy	
right? You can watch videos
and record videos of your own.
180044	Do you take videos?|Is that useful?
180045	I've been testing out
recording my flair bartending
practice from various angles.
180046	And it's been
super-duper helpful.
180047	I can instantly check
what I'm doing well
or getting wrong.
180048	I wanna see your videos!|You're really working hard.
180049	Well	 I was wearing my
tracksuit	 so I don't know
if I want to show you that...
180050	Sure am	 haha! But I'm glad to
hear you say that	 thanks.
180051	Anyway	 I have a favor to ask.
Would you mind recording me?
180052	I want to watch myself from my
customers' perspective	 to see
if I need to work on anything.
180053	I'll hand you my phone
the next time you're here.
Help me out	 will you?
180054	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	
have you tried making that
mocktail recipe I taught you?
180055	Of course!|I've been practicing at home.
180056	Great! As your mocktail
mentor	 I'm glad to see
you put in the effort.
180057	Knowing you as well as I do	
I knew you wouldn't
disappoint!
180058	If you don't get something	
feel free to ask me for help
anytime.
180059	I don't have the ingredients.|I'm missing some tools.
180060	Oh	 right! I'll take you
to one of our suppliers
next time.
180061	Right	 you do need some
specific ones. I'll take you
shopping next time!
180062	I'm so happy that you're
making my mocktails	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
180063	I'll try to help you
as much as I can!
180064	I thought I was getting
a little out of shape.
180065	That's why I started working
out not too long ago.
180066	My belly flab's all gone!
It feels incredible.
180067	That's great!|You're one hard worker.
180068	Aww	 you're making me blush.
But go on! Keep the
compliments flowing!
180069	I even have alcohol-free
days so I can really
give it my all.
180070	Proud of you!|Queen of all bartenders!
180071	Hehe	 more! Praise me more!
180072	Just kidding. I'm responsible;
I won't let it go to my head.
180073	That reminds me...
You enjoy sports and stuff	
right {PLAYER_NAME}-kun?
180074	I'd love to hear about your
training regimen sometime.
180075	Lately	 I've been taking
this boxercise class
at the gym I'm going to.
180076	It's basically training
that incorporates
boxing techniques...
180077	We have to do all these quick
moves	 but it's super fun!
180078	The gym has other courses too.
They're so much better than
just running on a treadmill!
180079	Fun should be number one.|You should try them all out.
180080	You're so right!
180081	You know	 they even
have dance courses
like jazz and hula.
180082	I was thinking it might
be nice to dance again.
180083	I might try next time I go.
180175	It'd help with your work.|Can't wait to see your moves.
180176	Right? I was thinking
the same!
180177	Well now I want to try
even harder!
180085	Talking to you never fails
to motivate me.
180086	I'm going to do whatever
I can to level up!
180087	I've added a lot of mocktail
recipes to my repertoire.
180088	But it could be nice to pair
them with some food.
180089	You should do something rich.|Something filling sounds nice.
180090	Is that what people who
don't drink tend to prefer?
180091	Right	 since alcohol isn't
the focus	 I could serve the
mocktails as part of a meal.
180092	I'm glad I talked it out
with you.
180093	I'm starting to think
a full meal would sell
better than snacks.
180094	That said	 we're not a
restaurant. We can't
make anything too fancy.
180095	I'll try talking to the owner
and the other bartenders.
180096	Your feedback's been
very helpful. Thank you!
180097	Can you cook	
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun?
180098	Sure can!|Define "cook."
180099	Oh	 I had a feeling
you'd say that!
180100	I'm... not terrible	 I think.
180101	Most of my repertoire
consists of bar snacks.
I don't cook at home at all.
180102	What kind of dishes
do you like to cook?
180103	I just throw stuff on rice.|Hot pots are my go-to.
180104	Hehe	 sounds good to me!
Rice bowls with toppings
of the day	 huh...?
180105	Yeah	 they are pretty easy.
And healthy to boot.
180106	Maybe I was aiming too high
with the bar menu.
180107	I think I'll start with some
easy-to-serve items.
180108	Heeeyyyyyy!
180109	You there?
Wakey-wakey!
¡Buenos días!
180110	Are you drunk?|Something wrong?
180111	Hahaha!
180112	I'm in a good mood and
thought I'd text you!
180113	The world's spinning
round and round!
180114	I'm spinning too! Haha! Whee!
180115	I can imagine.|Like a record.
180116	Right!
180117	Wheeeeee!!!
180118	What a great day!
180119	See youuuuuu!
180120	Salutations	
{PLAYER_NAME}-sama.
180121	What's wrong?|"Salutations"?
180122	I just saw the gibberish
I sent you last time.
180123	As you can probably tell	
I was very drunk back then.
180124	I don't even remember sending
them	 to be honest.
180125	I'm very VERY sorry you
had to deal with that...
180126	It was funny.|You were cute.
180127	I'm sure drunk me would
be happy to hear that.
180128	Hey!
I'm a beautiful lady—not cute!
180129	Still	 thanks for making this
whole thing into a fun memory.
180130	Ugh	 I can't believe myself...
180131	I hope you won't follow in my
footsteps once you're older.
Drink responsibly!
180132	Lately	 I've been trying my
hand at making a bunch of
new cocktails and mocktails.
180133	Now I feel like I've gained
weight from all the
taste-testing I'm doing.
180134	You look fine to me.|That's rough.
180135	I'll make up for it with
more workouts!
180136	Yeah	 it sure is.
180137	I know you can't drink	
but you should come
to the bar sometime.
180138	Nah	 forget it. I'm the adult
here. I can't be relying
on you all the time.
180139	I don't mind at all.|Bring on the taste-test-athon!
180140	Oh	 you're always so smooth.
180141	I don't know how you do it...
180142	¡Buenas noches!
Ni hao!
Hiiiii!
180143	Ugh	 I can't take it anymore!
180144	I wanna see youuu!
180145	I wish you'd come by
my work more!
180146	Sorry...|I will	 I will.
180147	Okay	 but!
180148	I really mean it!
180149	Also	 for the record...
180150	I'm not drunk tonight!
180151	Ahhh! I said it!
Okay	 bye bye!
190000	So {PLAYER_NAME}-kun	
do you come to Shibuya a lot?
190001	Sure do.|Yeah	 it's close to my school.
190002	Cool	 me too.
190003	It's the perfect place to go
to busk it out	 y'know?
190004	If you see me there again	
feel free to say hi!
190005	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	
you play bass	 right?
190006	Why'd you pick
that instrument?
190007	I just wanted to try it out.|I kind of stumbled into it...
190008	Oh! Bass is pretty hard
though! That's impressive.
190009	It'd be cool to play
with you sometime.
190010	I feel like every time
we see each other	
you end up helping me out.
190011	I'm really grateful.
190012	You're welcome.|Just doing my part.
190013	At this point	 just seeing
your face is enough
to calm my nerves.
190014	I'm gonna keep at it
for my street shows!
190015	That first time you listened
to me sing in the park
190016	I thought my heart was gonna
pop out of my chest.
190017	But it ended up
being really fun!
190018	It reminded me of the first
time I sung with my band.
190019	Thanks for the show.|Looking forward to next time!
190020	No	 thank you for stopping by!
190021	Yeah! You can find me
in Shibuya.
190022	Speaking of the park
190023	we should go to there
again sometime!
190024	Hey	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
190025	What kinda music are you into?
190026	Songs that pump me up.|Chill beats.
190027	I see...
190028	Yeah	 that seems like you.
190029	Does it now?|Why do you ask?
190030	Yeah	 but maybe that's
just how I see you.
190031	Sorry if that was random!
But no real reason...
190032	I'm just a little stuck on the
song I'm writing right now.
190033	Thanks for your input!
190034	So I was out busking
in Shibuya
190035	and some girls around your age
came up to listen.
190036	They told me they were fans!
190037	Congrats!|I'm your fan too.
190038	Right? Thanks!
190039	I know you are!
You're my first and most
important fan after all.
190040	It's just... it was my first
time hearing strangers
call themselves fans of mine
190041	so it kinda got me
all hyped up!
190042	I know that this is
out of the blue
190043	but thanks for everything.
190044	You're welcome?|What do you mean?
190045	When I'm feeling down
190046	you're always there
to lift me up.
190047	So I wanted to say thanks.
190048	You lifted yourself up.|I couldn't just leave you.
190049	Yeah	 but I feel like you
were the one who gave me
the strength to do it.
190050	Yeah	 but it's like...
I'm older than you	 y'know!
190051	Anyway...
190052	It's because of you that
I can stay positive
190053	so thanks.
190054	{PLAYER_NAME}-kun	
you just started playing
bass recently	 right?
190055	'Cause when we were
playing together earlier	
I was thinking...
190056	you're pretty good at this.
190057	Thanks.|You think so?
190058	A bassist has always gotta
be on point with both
the rhythm and root notes.
190059	That makes it a pretty
difficult instrument	 I think.
190060	It's easier than it looks.|I guess practice paid off.
190061	I dunno	 I tried playing
my friend's bass
back in the day.
190062	But I found it
pretty complex...
190063	That's true. I guess
every instrument just
takes practice.
190064	Speaking of rehearsals though	
you've got some mad tambourine
skills	 too.
190065	I'll have to put in some more
time with my guitar if I wanna
keep up with you!
190066	So {PLAYER_NAME}-kun...
190067	What do you think about
when you're playing bass?
190068	It's hard to put into words.|Nothing in particular...
190069	Hm... Okay	 lemme
rephrase my question.
190070	Remember that bit you
freestyled in our last
jam sesh together?
190071	The thing is... I can't get
that lick you played out
of my head.
190072	I wanna come up with catchy
riffs like that myself too
190073	but I've been trying
and it's not easy...
190074	Do you remember what was
going through your head
when you did that improv bit?
190075	I wanted to impress you.|I gave myself to the rhythm.
190076	Ah	 so you were thinking
about me even during
your own solo then...
190077	Gave yourself to
the rhythm	 huh?
190078	Maybe hearing you play
what you like made me
enjoy it even more?
190079	Thanks	 you've been
a big help!
190080	So	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun	
about your band...
190081	You've got guitar	 bass	
drums	 and keys	 right?
190082	Yeah?|What about it?
190083	It's not a big deal
or anything
190084	but on our trip before	
we talked about the songs
you play in your club	 right?
190085	But like	 there were a bunch
that I wasn't sure how you
could play with that setup.
190086	So I've kinda been wondering
how you go about it...
190087	Our keyboardist works hard.|I don't really know either.
190088	Oh	 I see! If it's a synth
keyboard	 then I guess you
four could manage with that.
190089	Maybe the other instruments
are getting added in post	 or
you're using a synth keyboard?
190090	I was just curious is all!
Thanks for humoring me.
190091	Being a musician
is so expensive!
190092	Is it?|Did something happen?
190093	I managed to save up some of
my paycheck	 so I bought some
pro recording equipment...
190094	Bam	 back to zero savings
with just a few mouse clicks.
190095	Plus	 apartments that
let you play music indoors
don't come cheap...
190096	Just picturing the numbers
on my next bank statement
is making me depressed...
190097	You okay there?|Regretting your purchases?
190098	Yeah... I'll be fine. It's not
like my account's in danger
of hitting zero or anything.
190099	Nah. It's not like my
account is in danger of hitting
zero or anything. It's just...
190100	I guess that's just the price
I gotta pay to do what I love.
I'll pay it off soon enough.
190101	Thanks for listening to my
whining. I'll let you know
when my gear arrives!
190102	Remember that recording
equipment I blew my
paycheck on?
190103	Well	 it's all here now!
190104	Nice.|What did you get?
190105	A bunch of stuff.
A new mic	 headphones	
an audio interface...
190106	I even bought this recording
software that all the pros
use. It was pretty pricey tbh!
190107	But that's not all! I also got
a synth keyboard	 more cables	
and some spare strings.
190108	I feel like there's no way
I can't make some
great music now!
190109	Good luck!|Isn't that all a bit much?
190110	Thanks! Look forward
to my next song	 okay!
190111	It's a symbol of my resolve
to take music seriously
from now on!
190112	It's all still boxed up
right now	 though...
190113	I'm gonna go unpack
everything now. I can't
wait to try it all out!
190114	I told you all the recording
equipment I ordered
showed up	 right?
190115	Yeah	 I remember.|Was there a problem?
190116	So	 I got all the devices
hooked up to start
composing and recording.
190117	But then the software wouldn't
launch	 and my PC wouldn't
detect the audio interface...
190118	Every step of the setup	
I was getting endless
stupid errors.
190119	I basically had to look up
every single fix	 but I
got it done in the end.
190120	It only took half my life...
190121	Good work!|Ready to start writing songs?
190122	Thanks... Now I can finally
get to the song writing part!
190123	Of course! I haven't been
doing all of this for nothing.
190124	I'm really excited to make
some new music.
190125	I also can't wait for you
to hear them!
190126	I've been going to Inokashira
Park a lot to practice singing
and playing at the same time.
190127	The strays that live there
have started coming over
to listen to my songs.
190128	Cats really like you	 huh?|Stray cats!?
190129	They always have. Though that
cat from last time at the park
was one I see pretty often.
190130	Yeah! I usually give
a few pats to the ones
I recognize.
190131	Anyway	 their tails
started bouncing along
to the rhythm...
190132	It was so CUTE!
190133	Having a feline audience
felt kinda weird	 but in
a good way.
190134	I just had to text you
about it.
190135	Thanks for listening.
190136	Sometimes	 when I'm
working on a guitar lick
or my backlog of housework
190137	something totally unrelated
will just pop into my head.
190138	Does that happen to you?
190139	For sure.|Not that I can think of...
190140	You too	 huh...
Isn't it weird!?
190141	Hm	 I see. It happens
to me a lot.
190142	It's like with no warning	
some random thought appears
and totally consumes my brain.
190143	Earlier	 I was working out
a riff for a song on the keys
and suddenly thought of you.
190144	And before I knew it	
I sent you a text.
Sorry	 haha!
190145	Hey	 {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
190146	I finished my new
song lyrics!
190147	I want to hear it!|You're done already!?
190148	Sure!
190149	Or so I'd like to say	 but...
190150	I know	 right!?
Especially since I struggled
a lot with the last one.
190151	But...
190152	I've got a report due soon for
one of my worst classes.
190153	So even though I'm done with
the lyrics	 I'll have to put
the melody writing on hold...
190154	Hopefully	 once my report's
done	 inspiration will strike
and I can play you the song!
190155	So I was performing in
Shibuya today	 right?
190156	And this guy from a record
company asked if I would
put out a song with them!
190157	Congrats!|Could this be your big break!?
190158	Thank you! It's just a small
indie label	 but still.
190159	No	 no	 it's just with an
indie label. No big break
for me yet.
190160	When we performed that new
song	 one of the fans took
a video on her phone	 right?
190161	Well	 apparently she uploaded
it to a video site	 and that's
how the record label found me.
190162	Oh	 and you know what
the record company rep
said to me?
190163	The dude on the bass was
good. Is he in your band?
190164	So how about it? Wanna form
a duo and debut with me?
190165	Sure!|I'll think about it.|Thanks	 but...
190166	Haha!
190167	If I hear anything more
from them	 I'll make sure
you're the first to know!
190500	AAAAAA==
190501	Could we meet up now?
190502	AAAAAA==
190503	AAAAAA==
190504	AAAAAA==
190600	AAAAAA==
190601	AAAAAA==
190602	AAAAAA==
190603	Awesome! I'll be waiting
at my usual spot.
190604	AAAAAA==
180152	By the way...
180153	I wonder what you'd be like
if you got drunk.
180154	I think I'd be relaxed.|I'd probably go off the walls.
200000	AAAAAA==
180155	Yeah	 I can very easily
imagine that!
180156	Haha	 it's fun to see
someone who's always
so calm let loose.
180157	But we won't know until
you're old enough to drink.
180158	Will you be just the way
you are? Will I get to see
a new side of you?
180159	Maybe you'll even
start bawling?
180160	I'm looking forward to
drinking with you someday.
180161	Promise you'll have your
first drink with me?
180162	Sometimes I think about you...
180163	...and I'd wish you'd
hurry up and become a
mature young man already.
180164	I will in a few years.|I'm already grown up.
180165	Yeah? Guess I can wait
a little longer.
180166	You're definitely mature for
your age	 but no real adult
says that out loud!
180167	You know	 if you were older...

with me	 you have to go home
before it's too late	 right?
180171	Once you're a grown-up though	
we can drink the night away.
180172	Why not start now?|I can't wait.|We'd just drink?
