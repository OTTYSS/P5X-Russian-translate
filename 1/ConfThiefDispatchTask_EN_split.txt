Pardon me, darlin', got a sec? You see, every time Orobas comes 'round, he's flappin' his gums about elegance and grace. It's enough to make a lady's ears turn red! Someone needs to rein in that holier-than-thou attitude. Got any stylish friends who could humble him a bit?
Bless her heart, that Leanan Sidhe ain't got a soul to confide in. You reckon there's a cheerful gentleman out there who'd be willin' to talk with her? They'd best be resilient enough to resist her temptations... or to thick to even notice.
Well, I'll be! That high-and-mighty Neko Shogun's gone and made off with my merchandise and refuses to return it! Maybe a fellow feline could sweet-talk 'em into doin' the right thing. Know any cats with a silver tongue?
Now, I don't mean to fuss, but a Shiisaa's been out on the road practicin' their lion dance like they're tryin' to summon a rainstorm. Gotta say, it's mighty impressive, but they've gone and blocked the whole dang road! Perhaps if someone joined in, they'd move along. Know anyone with fancy footwork like that?
Y'all ever heard of a shadow named Alice? That poor young girl's always by her lonesome. Seems to me she could sure use a friend. Reckon you know anyone who could keep her company?
I heard them Mandrakes can be used to whip up some sorta cure-all potion. Trouble is, every time I try to get near one, they skedaddle faster than a jackrabbit while screamin' bloody murder! Don't suppose you know someone who knows a lot about medicine and got the patience to deal with 'em?
That Ame-no-Uzume's got moves that'd make the angels jealous. But I can't help but wonder if she ever gets tired of always dancing by her lonesome. Got any friends who'd be up for joining her?
Well, bless my stars! There's a Treasure Demon guardin' a secret entrance. What do ya reckon's hidin' in there? Bet it's somethin' shiny and worth a fortune! I bet we could get them to move if we throw 'em somethin' soft and round... if you catch my drift.
That old rubber ball made the Treasure Demon happier than a dog with two tails! But who'd've known that secret entrance led to a baseball stadium!? I must confess, I don't really know anythin' about sports... Could any of your friends show me around?
There's a whole stash of rare stuff sittin' in that stadium! But I can't get even a hair closer to any of it with that aggressive pitching machine standin' guard. If you know a batter good enough to hit them balls outta the park, we might just be able to grab the goods. I'll give ya a fair slice of the spoils!
Would ya look at that. Another secret entrance! That Treasure Demon, though, don't seem to care none 'bout that rubber ball no more. It's askin' for something rectangular and flat... I'm stumped for ideas on what that could be\u2014how 'bout you?
That Treasure Demon was happier than a rooster in a henhouse when I showed it that Movie Ticket Stub! Turns out that secret entrance leads to an old Japanese castle of sorts, but lemme tell ya, it's got traps nastier than a snake in the grass. Now it really feels like somethin' out of a movie. If you got any pals who know a thing or two 'bout this place, I'd appreciate their help gettin' around!
My stars, have you ever seen a castle this big? I thought castles were supposed to be old, too... but what's with all these cameras? I ain't got the brains for these puzzles either, so if you know someone who does, I'll make sure you get a cut of the treasure!
Well, sugar, business ain't been too hot lately... But I heard folks'll buy just 'bout anything if there's a cute mascot peddlin' it. You reckon people are really that easy to win over? Could you be a dear and find me a cute mascot before I have to file for bankruptcy?
Land sakes, that Shadow Bessa is drivin' me up the wall... Keeps harpin' on about findin' guests for their show's opening ceremony. I'd be much obliged if you could round up your friends with pizzazz and sparkle, that's sure to get 'em off my back so I can get back to my deliveries!
I've been mullin' over the idea of startin' a new store 'round here... But that Jack Frost's got the roads slipperier than a snake in a bucket of oil. If you know anyone who's got a knack for skatin', send 'em my way, would ya?
Well, bless my heart, this next delivery's a hike and a half. I'd usually just hoof it, but I'm feelin' mighty low on energy. Know anyone who can give me a ride to the destination?
I've got a delivery that's hotter than a skillet on a summer day! Problem is, it's gotta stay that way. You know anyone who could help me keep it nice 'n' warm?
Y'all won't believe this\u2014I found a spot loaded with rare items! But, wouldn't ya figure, it's swarmin' with Shadows. If you know anyone who's good at fightin' in a team, they'd be just the ticket!
Urgh... lately, some downright frightenin' Shadows have been swipin' my goods from right under me! I'm at my wit's end now with these bandits. Say, got any strong friends who can give them no-good vermin a good thumpin' for me?
Well, shoot... the ringleader of them bandit Shadows came struttin' over and threatened to clean me out for good next time. I don't know how much more my little shop can take. I'm gonna need some friends of yours to work security for me in case he comes back.
This new order's some kinda heavy steel gizmo... looks like it might be a weapon? My shop ain't exactly set up for this sorta thing, but as a pro, I refuse to shy away from the challenge! Got any friends who know their weapons?
I've been tryin' to get some new trade routes up and runnin', but them Shadows done blocked the way. It's a real pain for business, lemme tell ya. I hear they'll let ya through if you can outmuscle 'em, but I ain't up for that kinda thing. Say, any of them pals of yours any good at taking out single enemies?
Well, ain't that just my luck. Them bandit Shadows are back, and this time, there's a whole swarm of 'em! I can't focus on my deliveries with all this trouble brewin'. Got any strong pals who could put 'em in their places for me?
That ol' bandit Shadow leader just don't know when to quit. He's got himself a bunch of strong bodyguards taggin' along. Things're about to get a li'l dicey 'round here. Sorry to trouble ya again, but I sure could use your help.
Oof... Today's delivery is heavier than a mule in the mud! Just how am I expected to drag around something like this all by myself? I betcha this would be a breeze if I had the wind at my back! Any of your friends know how to whip up a gust or two?
I've been thinkin' of openin' a new trade route for my li'l shop. Trouble is, it's riddled with thorns and that ain't safe. Well, 'specially not for someone like me who likes wearin' sandals. Know anyone who can rescue me from this predicament?
Well, ain't this somethin'... Them bandit Shadows are back, and it looks like they've brought a whole lot more trouble with 'em. Could ya round up your strongest friends to deal with 'em?
Well, here we go again... That bandit Shadow boss done showed up, and he's brought along a bunch of tough bodyguards. I reckon they're lookin' to steal my goods. Sorry to trouble ya, but I'd be mighty grateful if you could put an end to this.
Got me a delivery of frozen goods, but I reckon the customer won't be too happy if it's all melted by the time I show up. Any chance you know someone who can help keep it cool?
I've got my eye on a new trade route for business, but the area's full of aggressive Shadows that keep ambushin' folks. You reckon you know anybody who's good at defense? Perhaps they could lend me a hand?
Aw, heck... Them bandit Shadows are back at it. You know the ones I mean. And I swear, there's more of 'em now than ever! Where do they keep crawlin' out from? Think your strong buddies could help me out one more time?
Shoot, that leader of them bandit Shadows is back again! Persistent fella, ain't he? Now he's got even more guards taggin' along. Two can play at that game though, right, sugar? Mind sharin' a few of your strongest friends with me? I'll make it worth your while!
I've been thinkin' of sprucin' up my shop lineup with some quirky goodies! How weird, you ask? Well, I've got this rock that can store electricity. Only problem is, it ain't worth much if I don't have a way to charge it. You know someone who can give it a good zap?
Marthym's Shop is expandin' again with a brand-new trade route! It's excitin', sure, but this one's really dark and difficult to navigate. Could any of your friends help support me while I'm out there?
Uh-oh, this ain't good... Them bandit Shadows are back, and they've gone and armed themselves real proper this time. I hate to keep askin', but I'd be mighty grateful of you could ask them strong friends of yours to handle this lickety-split.
Not this nonsense again! That bandit Shadow leader's back, and he's got a whole crew of armored guards tougher than a cast-iron skillet. I'm beggin' ya sugar\u2014you gotta save me!
I've been hearin' folks talk 'bout these things called Attributes lately... Fire, Ice, Wind, Electricity\u2014stuff like that. Reckon understandin' them might help me whip up some better goods. Could you introduce me to anyone who knows a lot about this stuff?
Had some business talks go south on me the other day. Think you might know anyone who could help me polish up my diplomacy skills?
Thank ya kindly for your advice on negotiatin' the other day\u2014it's gonna help me keep my customers smilin'! But I reckon I need to work on my strength, too, seein' as I'm always totin' my wares on my noggin. Got any strong friends who could help with my trainin'?
Turns out there's a whole lot more to them Attributes than I thought\u2014Psychokinesis, Nuclear, Curse, Bless... That's quite the lineup, ain't it? I reckon my shop could make some mighty fine wares usin' them. Say, got any friends who're well-versed in this sorta thing?
I'd like to say a big thank-you for always coming 'round and supportin' my business. I've been rackin' my brain tryin' to figure out how to return the favor, but I just don't know where to start. You reckon any of your friends could give me a few pointers on how to support you?
I can't thank ya enough for all the things you've taught me. I feel like I've grown a whole lot as a small business owner. Now I'm ready to put my skills to the real test. I'm talkin' knowledge, talkin' deals, gettin' in shape\u2014the whole lot. Don't suppose any of those strong pals o' yours could give me a hand?
I stumbled on somethin' odd by the roadside the other day. Looked like a little piece of desire, or maybe a fragment of someone's consciousness\u2014I can't say for sure. But it felt like it might be connected to one of your friends. I'll let ya know where it was, in case you wanna go look.
I got a little favor to ask... Well, I was hopin' to strike up some business with some Shadows, but I gotta say\u2014I'm as nervous as a cow goin' downstairs. You reckon you could ask your friends to help mediate?

Thanks to your efforts, desire's finally returnin' to this gloomy world. Y'know, I've been seein' fragments of consciousness scattered all 'round Mementos. They might be worth collectin', don't ya think? Might be worth askin' them friends of yours to grab 'em for ya.
Dear Loyal Customer, Marthym's Shop would like to sincerely thank you for all your support! As a little token of gratitude, I'll let ya in on somethin' I spotted while I was out makin' deliveries. You'll have to go get it yourself, but I think it's somethin' you won't wanna miss.

I've made up my mind\u2014I'm takin' a trip to learn some new tools of the trade. But I hear it's more dangerous than a hog in a smokehouse out there! If you could lemme borrow a few of your friends, including someone who can keep us healed up, I'd sure feel a whole lot better 'bout this journey.
I came across somethin' real curious\u2014it's a rock! But not just any rock, this one's tougher than a brick house. Think folks'd be interested in durable wares made of this stuff? Hmm... maybe we should give it a good testin' first. Got a few friends who could help us out?
I hear humans are wild for them "bargain sales." Oh, but if I were to do somethin' like that, I'd be busier than a squirrel in a nut factory tryin' to handle all them crowds! Say now, I could do with a power up, and my customers could do with a major power down, if you catch my drift!
Now that I'm expandin' my business, I need to get out there and start new ventures... But land sakes, all the good spots are far off, and I'm feelin' a bit uneasy about goin' it alone. I'd sure appreciate havin' some company so I stay safe while I handle my goods. Got any pals who'd make good bodyguards?
Mementos is lookin' rougher than a tumbleweed in a tornado these days. All these odd desires are stirrin' the Shadows into a frenzy and it's makin' life hard for a small business owner like me. I could definitely benefit from some hired muscle. Could any of your friends shield me from danger?
Oh dearie. My poor little shoulders've been feelin' stiff as a fence post lately. But I can't just up and leave the shop unattended, now can I? Say, maybe you could lend me a hand? If you have any friends that can help support me, why I'd be happier than a pig in the sunshine!
Well, I'll be! I've been feelin' sore as a mule lately, and wouldn't ya know it, turns out an Obariyon's been clingin' to my back like a burr on a hound dog this whole time! I'm supposed to be totin' goods, not this critter. I'd be pleased as punch if you introduce me to your friends who can support me!
Do I have some news for you, honey pie! Did you know that by taking an Obariyon home, you might get a big pile of shiny gold coins? But let me tell ya, it ain't as easy as it sounds. Do a girl a favor and introduce me to some friends who can offer me support, would ya?
Y'all ain't gonna believe this, but I saw somethin' real shiny and rare the other day! Now, you can just imagine my heartbreak when I lost sight of it while I was tendin' to my business... But I reckon I'd like to try huntin' it down again. Don't s'pose you know anybody good at supportin' others who could lend me a hand, do ya?

Do I have some news for you, honey pie! Did you know that by taking an Obariyon home, you might get a big pile of shiny gold coins? But let me tell ya, it ain't as easy as it sounds. Do a girl a favor and introduce me to some friends who can offer me support, would ya?
Guess what? I found me a place just crawlin' with Obariyons! If I can scoop 'em all up, I'll be sittin' on a goldmine. Don't tell me you wouldn't wanna get in on this. Call your friends who can provide support and let's get to it!
Y'all ain't gonna believe this, but I saw somethin' real shiny and rare the other day! Now, you can just imagine my heartbreak when I lost sight of it while I was tendin' to my business... But I reckon I'd like to try huntin' it down again. Don't s'pose you know anybody good at supportin' others who could lend me a hand, do ya?

You know Setanta, right? That Shadow in the tough-lookin' armor... Yeah, that one. Well, he's set up camp by the side of the road and won't let nobody through. If you got any friends who know how to pack a punch, I'd appreciate if you could ask them to get him out of my hair.
Well, ain't this somethin'? That Setanta's back again, callin' himself a gatekeeper and blockin' off the whole dang road. And I mean really blockin' it\u2014ain't nobody gettin' through. I'm gonna need a few of your pals to give him a good thumpin' ASAP.

Hey, got a minute? There's a wicked Black Ooze cloggin' up the path and gettin' around it's been a real chore. That thing's made the road sticker than a syrup-soaked pancake! Know anyone strong enough to scrape that blob of tar out of my sight?
Well, shoot! That Black Ooze is back, and it's bigger and meaner than ever. Now the road's all slicked up with its sticky goo, and I'm stuck. Could you round up those tough friends of yours to take it down?

Oh dearie me... A couple of Matadors are tauntin' each other. What's a poor li'l business owner to do? If only some kind souls with a knack for defendin' others were to step in... Hint, hint.

I got somethin' big brewin'\u2014a job that could roll in more dough than a pastry chef on fire! But I gotta keep it cheap to make it worth it. Got any sharp negotiators in your crew?
Well, I've been thinkin' 'bout growin' my business lately, but there's this downright creepy Incubus hangin' 'round, givin' me the heebie-jeebies. I just don't have the strength in me to deal with this. Say, could any of your friends give me a power boost?

Dang it! I think I ticked off a succubus. She's been glarin' at me like I stole her last biscuit. I was just tryin' to expand my business! Maybe I accidentally stepped into her turf... Anyhoo, there's no tellin' what she might do next! You know anyone who's good at weakening enemies?

That darn Succubus is still givin' me the stink eye. I reckon she's just bidin' her time to make her move. You got any friends who are good at weakening enemies? Preferably tougher than the ones from before? Then we could give her a taste of her own medicine...

Oh no... That Succubus is back, and she brought her girlfriends along! We're outnumbered, but this might be our golden opportunity to flip the script and send 'em packin' for good. Remember to bring friends who're really, really good at weakening enemies and I'll be forever grateful!

Oh dearie. My poor little shoulders've been feelin' stiff as a fence post lately. But I can't just up and leave the shop unattended, now can I? Say, maybe you could lend me a hand? If you have any friends that can help support me, why I'd be happier than a pig in the sunshine!
Well, I'll be! I've been feelin' sore as a mule lately, and wouldn't ya know it, turns out an Obariyon's been clingin' to my back like a burr on a hound dog this whole time!

Do I have some news for you, honey pie! Did you know that by taking an Obariyon home, you might get a big pile of shiny gold coins? But let me tell ya, it ain't as easy as it sounds. Do a girl a favor and introduce me to some friends who can offer me support, would ya?
Y'all ain't gonna believe this, but I saw somethin' real shiny and rare the other day! Now, you can just imagine my heartbreak when I lost sight of it while I was tendin' to my business...

You know Setanta, right? That Shadow in the tough-lookin' armor... Yeah, that one. Well, he's set up camp by the side of the road and won't let nobody through. If you got any friends who know how to pack a punch, I'd appreciate if you could ask them to get him out of my hair.

Hey, got a minute? There's a wicked Black Ooze cloggin' up the path and gettin' around it's been a real chore. That thing's made the road sticker than a syrup-soaked pancake! Know anyone strong enough to scrape that blob of tar out of my sight?
Well, shoot! That Black Ooze is back, and it's bigger and meaner than ever. Now the road's all slicked up with its sticky goo, and I'm stuck. Could you round up those tough friends of yours to take it down?

Howdy there, I could use your help. This Matador just showed up, wavin' his cape and darin' me to try and get past. What a load of bull... Are any of your friends good at keeping a solid guard up? I could use their help!
Oh dearie me... A couple of Matadors are tauntin' each other. What's a poor li'l business owner to do? If only some kind souls with a knack for defendin' others were to step in... Hint, hint.

Well, butter my biscuit. I've got a fragile order to deliver but I can't shake the feelin' some sneaky Shadows might come sniffin' while I'm at it. Got any friends who are good at defending and offering support? I could do with some protection.

A top-of-the-line merchant such as myself is always ready to handle any situation, but hey, sometimes life throws ya somethin' ya didn't see comin'. I'd sure be grateful if I had a medic on standby.

Well, bless my soul! The other day, I was out stretchin' my legs when I tripped over a Koropokguru. My goods went flyin' everywhere like popcorn in a hot skillet! Looks like it'll be a spell before I'm back in business. I'd be awfully grateful if I had someone to help me get back on my feet.

Well, I've been thinkin' 'bout growin' my business lately, but there's this downright creepy Incubus hangin' 'round, givin' me the heebie-jeebies. I just don't have the strength in me to deal with this. Say, could any of your friends give me a power boost?
Some sneaky Incubus has been causin' a stir, layin' traps here and there. I don't know what that little critter's plannin', but it's sure makin' my life harder. Got any friends who can help me out and give me a buff or two?
That pesky Incubus done called in his buddies... He's lookin' mighty hard\u2014uh, hard to beat, I mean\u2014but this might just be your shot, ya hear? Show him you ain't fallin' for his tricks, and he'll skedaddle faster than a scared possum. Know anyone who's good with buffs?
I got somethin' big brewin'\u2014a job that could roll in more dough than a pastry chef on fire! But I gotta keep it cheap to make it worth it. Got any sharp negotiators in your crew?

Dang it! I think I ticked off a succubus. She's been glarin' at me like I stole her last biscuit. I was just tryin' to expand my business! Maybe I accidentally stepped into her turf... Anyhoo, there's no tellin' what she might do next! You know anyone who's good at weakening enemies?

That darn Succubus is still givin' me the stink eye. I reckon she's just bidin' her time to make her move. You got any friends who are good at weakening enemies? Preferably tougher than the ones from before? Then we could give her a taste of her own medicine...

Oh no... That Succubus is back, and she brought her girlfriends along! We're outnumbered, but this might be our golden opportunity to flip the script and send 'em packin' for good. Remember to bring friends who're really, really good at weakening enemies and I'll be forever grateful!
