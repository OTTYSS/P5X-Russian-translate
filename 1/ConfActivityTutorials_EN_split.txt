While business is open, customers will place orders, and you must quickly combine ingredients to <color=#FF423F>fulfill the order</color> and serve the shaved ice they request.
There is a <color=#FF423F>time limit</color> for how long customers are willing to wait for shaved ice. The waiting time is reset when the correct shaved ice is served.
Quickly and accurately serving shaved ice orders will improve the shop's <color=#FF423F>Reputation</color>.\n<color=#FF423F>1</color> Reputation point will convert to <color=#FF423F>20</color> Sales at the end of the shift.
Throw away shaved ice you've created by dragging it to the trash can.
Serving shaved ice and improving your Reputation will result in higher sales.\nThe goal of the shaved ice shop is to have the highest sales possible to bring in profit.
After the end of your shift, your friends may also stop by the shaved ice stand.\nTheir orders will count toward your total sales, so be sure to serve them the shaved ice they want.
In Endless Mode, you have unlimited time and customers.\nHowever, if you serve too many incorrect orders, your shift will end.

PC: Use the <color=#FF423F>mouse</color> to aim, <color=#FF423F>left click</color> to fire a single shot, and <color=#FF423F>hold down left click</color> to fire continuously.\nGamepad: Use the <color=#FF423F>Left Stick</color> to aim, <color=#FF423F>R2/RT</color> to fire a single shot, and hold down to fire continously.
When you hit a target, the number of hits required to destroy it will be displayed underneath.\nWhen the gauge reaches 0, the target will be destroyed.\nOne water shot usually deals <color=#FF423F>1</color> point of damage, but there are various ways to increase the damage.
When your water runs out, you will be unable to fire.\n<color=#FF423F>Release the fire button</color> to automatically refill water over time.
Each stage has multiple waves, and the current wave number is displayed at the top.\nWhen time runs out, all regular tagets will automatically disappear, and a new wave of targets will appear.
Hitting targets will build up combo points, and when your combo gets higher, you will earn more points for defeating targets.\nYou can get up to <color=#FF423F>3x</color> points with a combo of <color=#FF423F>400</color> or more.\nYour combo will be broken if you do not hit a target.
Explosive barrels will appear on this stage.\nWhen destroyed, they will deal heavy damage to surrounding targets.
An octopus will appear on this stage.\nWhen destroyed, it emits a plume of black smoke that obscures your view.
Shooting stars will appear in this stage.\nThey move fast, but if destroyed they will award a large amount of points.
A Pirate Captain will appear in this stage.\nWhen defeated, he will drop a treasure chest. Shoot the treasure quickly to earn a large amount of points.
A Kraken will appear in this stage.\nIt will appear when you have earned <color=#FF423F>800</color> points.\nWhen defeated, it awards a large amount of points and destroys all other targets onscreen.
In Endless Mode, there is no limit to the number of waves, and the targets are changed for each wave. The game will not end until you fail to meet a stage's requirements.
You can activate a support skill by tapping your teammate's icon on the bottom right.\nAfter using a skill, it will enter cooldown, and can be activated again once the cooldown is complete.
