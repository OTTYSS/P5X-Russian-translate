Working various jobs has most certainly\nhelped polish your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
Still, working with countless customers has\nsharpened your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
Working various jobs has most certainly\nhelped to polish your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
After standing tall during the rush, it seems\nyour <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> increased as well!
When you're surrounded by books, their\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> must surely rub off on you, hoom?
It will take a bit of <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to try it out.
It seems that commanding a wide range of\ncharacters has also increased your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
I see... By utilizing a wide range of\nskills, your personal <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>is\neven stronger.
It appears that your refined approach has\nfurther honed your <sprite=4><color=#ffb400>Proficiency</color>.
Pushing yourself that hard takes some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\n, I'll give you that.
In dealing with the oncoming threat, I can\ntell your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color> has been further honed.
Perhaps this affection you show them\nmeans your <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> has increased?
Putting all that work into the garden\nsurely teaches you greater <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>.
Spending time with animals has\ndeepened my <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
The stomach played a part no doubt, but your\n<sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>was the true key to victory.
All of your cultivated <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>,\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>,and <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> came together.
Fear not. Use the <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>, <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>,\nand <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> you've honed in battle...
I should be able to deepen my\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> if I study here...
I'm going to need more\n<sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color> if I want to\nwin this challenge...
Finishing that giant ramen's\ngoing to take careful\nconsideration and <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>.
It's going to take real <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\nto conquer such a gargantuan\nbowl of ramen...
It took some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\nto sing so boldly...
I feel like my <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>\nhas improved.
Now that I think about it,\nthat movie was a test\nof <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>.
Still, I feel like I have some\nmore <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> now...
Trying new flavors took\nsome <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>...
In my case it'd be <color=#FF423F>Kumi Katayama</color>.\nGot it?
Ah, that's right. Where are my manners?\nYou may call me... <color=#FF423F>Igor</color>.
And this here is... <color=#FF423F>Merope</color>. She serves\nas my assistant.
Oh, right... About the recent <color=#FF423F>Menace</color>\nincidents.
Someone's already sent it in for\n<color=#FF423F>Divine Justice</color>. Do you think Magatsukami will\ncondemn him as a Menace?
Is he really the one...? He certainly seems\nas though it's been <color=#FF423F>stolen</color> from him...
You may call me <color=#FF423F>Lufel</color>. I expect\nyour respect.
Those are <color=#FF423F>Shadows</color>. In other words, enemies.\nThey're here to kill us.
I am <color=#FF423F>J\xe1no\u0161\xedk</color>! Driver of your rapturous,\nblazing desire...
To think you awakened your <color=#FF423F>Persona</color> on your\nown! Here I was thinking I'd have to walk\nyou through every step!
We're still inside <color=#FF423F>Mementos</color>, so Shadows\nmay attack us at any moment.
Some enemies have <color=#FF423F>weaknesses</color> you can\nexploit to knock them down.
Come forth, <color=#FF423F>Robroy</color>!
You took a hit! <color=#FF423F>Heal</color> yourself!
It looks like they're packing a powerful\nwallop next! <color=#FF423F>Defend</color> yourself!
It seems I'll have no problem putting you\nto <color=#FF423F>work</color> right away.
First, let's defeat an enemy with\n<color=#FF423F>melee attacks</color>.
All right, now try calling your <color=#FF423F>Persona</color>!
Target the enemy's <color=#FF423F>weakness</color> to take\ncontrol of the battle.
Hitting an opponent's <color=#FF423F>weakness</color> lets\nyou do a <color=#FF423F>follow-up</color> attack.
But no need to panic, this can be <color=#FF423F>healed</color>!
At times like this, survival should be your\nfirst priority. <color=#FF423F>Guard</color>!
There, that's its<color=#FF423F>weakness</color>!
Use your <color=#FF423F>Gun</color> to aim for the enemy's\nweak points and knock them down!
Come forth, <color=#FF423F>Awilda</color>! Let's take back\nwhat's ours!
Hoom... That treasure chest is sealed with\nchains. I wonder what might happen if we\n<color=#FF423F>defeated the Shadow</color> beside it...
That's a <color=#FF423F>Depraved Shadow</color>.\nDefeat it, and you'll get <color=#FF423F>something good</color>.
It's best to use <color=#FF423F>single-target</color>\nskills to attack.
It's best to use <color=#FF423F>multi-target</color>\nskills to attack.
First, secure some method of <color=#FF423F>healing</color>,\nthen try to <color=#FF423F>knock the enemy down</color>.
This isn't where we need to go right now.\nOur priority is to <color=#FF423F>defeat Kiuchi</color>.
I never imagined <color=#FF423F>slamming into things</color>\nwould bring us here. Let's explore.
This trial... I suppose we can call it the\n<color=#FF423F>Velvet Trial</color> for convenience's sake.
Well, sugars, what can I say? <color=#FF423F>Marthym</color>'s the\nname, makin' sales is my game! And y'all look\nlike you could benefit from my services.
This here is a <color=#FF423F>Fare Machine</color>, and it's your\nticket to satisfying that hankerin' y'all got\nfor adventure!
Just slide your <color=#FF423F>Train Tickets</color> into the\nslot and you're all set. Simple as pie!
I'll bet my sandals it'll cause the area\nnearby to <color=#FF423F>shift</color> in ways you can't imagine...
I learned that the words<color=#FF423F>limited time only</color>\nhold great power over human hearts.
I have titled this limited-time-only trial\n<color=#FF423F>The Trials from the Sea of Souls</color>.
Additionally, you will need to find your way\nto the<color=#FF423F>Path of Aiyatsbus</color> to undertake\nthis trial.
To venture a guess... this place may be the\n<color=#FF423F>cognition of Kiuchi's palace itself</color>.
<color=#FF423F>%s</color>! Lend me strength!\nI'm gonna tear these brats apart!
As always, I must ask to you go to the trial\nlocation in <color=#FF423F>Area 3 of the Path of Qimranut</color>.
I will be waiting in <color=#FF423F>Area 3 of the\nPath of Qimranut</color>.
You'll need to <color=#FF423F>heal</color> before anything else.
I think you'll need to defeat the <color=#FF423F>Shadows\nin the back</color> before I can continue.

Only <color=#FF423F>S-Tier Fan Card</color> holders may pass.
This <color=#FF423F>fan card</color> seems like a key of some kind.
<color=#FF423F>C-Tier Fan Card</color> detected.\nAccess granted.
<color=#FF423F>D-Tier Fan Card</color> detected.\nAccess granted.
<color=#FF423F>B-Tier Fan Card</color> detected.\nAccess granted.
<color=#FF423F>A-Tier Fan Card</color> detected.\nAccess granted.
<color=#FF423F>S-Tier Fan Card</color> detected.\nAccess granted.
We need a <color=#FF423F>lockpick</color> to open this.
Only those who know the arts of <color=#FF423F>secrecy</color> and\n<color=#FF423F>ambushing</color>are qualified to pass here.
Before you begin, <color=#FF423F>hide your presence</color>.\nDon't disappoint Kiuchi-sama now.
Move in <color=#FF423F>secret</color> and keep alert.\nThen, while the enemy is unaware, attack!
Uhh... So basically we've gotta prove\nourselves by <color=#FF423F>stealth-attacking</color> an enemy?
<color=#FF423F>Avoid the enemy</color> and stay undetected.\nDon't disappoint Kiuchi-sama, now.
So we need to reach the other side while\n<color=#FF423F>avoiding the enemy</color>? Better keep quiet!
You have passed the test and may now take on\nthe honor of <color=#FF423F>guarding Kiuchi-sama's\nvaluables</color>.
<color=#FF423F>Guard</color> duty... Maybe the Shadows over there\nwould know more about this?
The display is malfunctioning.\n<color=#FF423F>Kiuchi's symbols</color> are scrolling across...
Kiuchi's symbol is <color=#FF423F>frozen on screen</color>...
What did the Shadow say again...?\n<color=#FF423F>3, 1, 3, 2, 0</color>?
This is... a <color=#FF423F>Palace map</color>.
I guess it's a kind of <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>, like for\na pro baseball player's fan club?
Then I take it that the big <color=#FF423F>C</color> on it means\nit's for <color=#FF423F>C-tier</color> fans?
It would seem that the <color=#FF423F>elevator</color> we passed\nearlier will bring us closer to the Treasure.
Please use the <color=#FF423F>southern gym</color> instead.
Hey, this looks just like that <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>\nwe picked up earlier.
They do indeed look similar! This one appears\nto be... <color=#FF423F>B-Tier</color>?
The <color=#FF423F>diary</color> that Shadow mentioned earlier\nmay contain some kind of hint.
But, I made it through with <color=#FF423F>Senpai</color>'s\nsupport!
He says he has to keep practicing to be\nready<color=#FF423F>when he's finally called up</color>.
I wonder if he's training alone in the\n<color=#FF423F>South Gym</color> again today...
It sounds like the <color=#FF423F>senpai</color> mentioned in the\ndiary is a reserve first baseman.
Okay, finished writing my <color=#FF423F>diary</color> entry, now\nI'd better get back to practice!
Wonder, there should be a <color=#FF423F>power box</color>\nnear here. Let's look for it.
The <color=#FF423F>cable</color>is going into this room...\nThere's a strange mark on the door, too.
The <color=#FF423F>cable</color>'s over here!
There's a <color=#FF423F>right-facing</color> light here...\nLet's try pushing it.
The <color=#FF423F>cable</color> goes to this room...
Is that flashing some kind of countdown?\nThis one may have a <color=#FF423F>time limit</color> on it.
We are regarded as <color=#FF423F>A-Tier</color> Kiuchi fans now.
Wow, that looks like a super rare <color=#FF423F>fan card</color>.
There's a super-duper amazing <color=#FF423F>fishing pond</color>\nin <color=#FF423F>Ichigaya</color>!
There's some super-duper great <color=#FF423F>batting cages</color>\nin <color=#FF423F>Yongen-Jaya</color>!
Well, there happen to be some irresistibly\ncute <color=#FF423F>Shichi-kun capsule toys</color> available now!
There is a significant possibility. If this\nis a movie... The <color=#FF423F>cameras</color> may be key.
Can they use their <color=#FF423F>powers of transformation</color>\nand observation to escape? Or are they stupid?
The way was blocked by an <color=#FF423F>ancient seal</color>! Will\nthis be the end for our little miscreants!?
For this trial can only be surmounted by the\ndemonic art of the <color=#FF423F>Cursed Eye of Time</color>!
To proceed, they will need to light the\nlanterns in the <color=#FF423F>proper order</color>... However!
Your quest is futile! For I am protected\nby the<color=#FF423F>loyalty</color> of my vassals...
Perhaps if we defeat those vassals,\n<color=#FF423F>something will change</color> here.
With the powers we've already taken, maybe\nwe're prepared to face <color=#FF423F>his lordship</color>.
Are we going to fight this <color=#FF423F>Shadow</color>?

For <color=#FF423F>ruin</color> awaits you.
I will act as your <color=#FF423F>concierge</color>. Please call\nme Merope.
If this is to be our <color=#FF423F>base of operations</color> for\nnurturing hope, I would prefer it have a\nsplash of color...
You don't remember me? <color=#FF423F>Kayo Tomiyama</color>?\nOur families would get together and have\ndinner every now and then.
Oh sorry, are you on your way to school\nright now? That's the uniform for <color=#FF423F>Kokatsu\nAcademy</color>, isn't it?
And he goes to <color=#FF423F>Kiga Academy</color>...\nI think it's him!
You haven't heard of <color=#FF423F>Magatsukami's</color>\n<color=#FF423F>Divine Justice</color>?
I'm <color=#FF423F>Tomoko Noge</color> from Class D. Motoha and I\nare best friends! Nice to meet you!
I want you to join me, and become a\n<color=#FF423F>Phantom Thief</color>.
That is our target. <color=#FF423F>Takeyuki Kiuchi</color>.
I refer to such items as <color=#FF423F>Treasure</color>.\nBut before we get into that...
Why not take a stroll around <color=#FF423F>Central Street</color>\nto clear your mind?
Let us head to Mementos straight away.\nI trust you have your <color=#FF423F>Metaverse Navigator</color>\nhandy?
Now our work has officially begun. From here\non we'll need to establish <color=#FF423F>code names</color>\nfor ourselves.
Master informed you before about\n<color=#FF423F>strengthening your desire to ward off ruin</color>.
The beings you have just witnessed are\n<color=#FF423F>cognitive forms</color>.
We shall call them <color=#FF423F>Phantom Idols</color>!
There's no mistake. Kiuchi's <color=#FF423F>Palace</color>\nis just ahead.
Now then, I'd like to coordinate our plan\nfor infiltration. Do you have a <color=#FF423F>workbench</color>\nwe can make use of?
Why don't you check the secondhand shop\nin <color=#FF423F>Yongen-Jaya</color>?
Gosh, when is the last time I went to the\nYongen <color=#FF423F>batting cages</color>?
It appears crafting those infiltration tools\nyesterday improved your <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
My true name is... Oh right! It's <color=#FF423F>Pixie</color>!
That means this is a safe place for us...\nA <color=#FF423F>Safe Room</color>, if you will.
Heheh. We shall call this ability of yours\nthe power of the <color=#FF423F>wild card</color>.
Go, <color=#FF423F>Awilda</color>! Batter up!
Hoohoo! I see. An <color=#FF423F>airsoft shop</color>?
<color=#FF423F>Munehisa</color>... <color=#FF423F>Iwai</color>?
If we're making it official, we should decide\non a <color=#FF423F>leader</color> too. I guess that'd be you, right, {NAME2}-kun?
It seems many people do their studying at\nthese "<color=#FF423F>diners</color>."
Both are suitable methods for improving\nyour <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>.
There's a <color=#FF423F>gym</color> down <color=#FF423F>Shibuya Center Street</color>.
If you're interested, how about going to\nthe <color=#FF423F>Shibuya movie theater</color>?
I sense the same energy from this as the\n<color=#FF423F>Red Fog</color>.
I really prefer to learn by doing. If you end\nup going to the Metaverse, I'd like to\ncome with and <color=#FF423F>test it out</color> for real.
Yes! Okay, every enemy is downed. Now it's\ntime for an <color=#FF423F>All-Out Attack</color>!
I will now introduce to you the process of\nPersona <color=#FF423F>Fusion</color>.
It's not that. It just hasn't\n<color=#FF423F>materialized</color> yet.
Okay! There's this place in <color=#FF423F>Shinjuku</color> I've\nbeen wanting to try. Let's go there.
There are more <color=#FF423F>Treasures</color>.
From what I am able to recall, there are\n<color=#FF423F>seven</color> Treasures in total. Which would mean...
I can tell you everything if you allow me to\n<color=#FF423F>read your fortune</color>!
<color=#FF423F>Victory Kitchen</color>... Well, it certainly\nhas character.
However, what I can discern from my most\nrecent recollections tells me that we ought to\nconsider our <color=#FF423F>next course of action</color>.
I've barely spoken to him before, but I'm\npretty sure he's in Class D with Tomoko...\nOh yeah, his name's <color=#FF423F>Shun Kano</color>.
No way. THE <color=#FF423F>Hiromu Miyazawa</color> swears by\nthis place. Subtle flavor means it's refined!
Yes, that's right. You'll be reviewing\n<color=#FF423F>Heritage Kitchen</color> in Zoshigaya.
I can see us setting up a whole chain in the\nnot too distant future. I know old\n<color=#FF423F>Pops Yamagoshi-san</color> will be pleased!
It's called <color=#FF423F>Takemi Medical Clinic</color>...
I'm sure the name of the clinic already gave\nit away, but I'm <color=#FF423F>Tae Takemi</color>.
This is a stick-up! Go, <color=#FF423F>Mandrin</color>!
I can sense the Treasure. It seems it's on\nthe <color=#FF423F>top floor</color> of that castle.
But I guess <color=#FF423F>they</color> cut ties with me anyway,\nso now is a good time to start over\nfrom scratch...
He seems to be absorbing desire... and\nfilling that apparatus with its <color=#FF423F>energy</color>.
Let's meet at Shimo-Kitazawa Station in the\nevening and head to <color=#FF423F>Kichijoji</color> together.
So...\nWe're meeting at a <color=#FF423F>caf\xe9</color>, right?
Focus! Katayama is only getting stronger!\n<color=#FF423F>Defend</color> yourselves!
See it through, <color=#72C5FF>Chiyome</color>!
Those <color=#FF423F>two eyes</color> closest to her haven't\nreally done anything up until now...
<color=#FF423F>This looks like a difficult\nfight. I should make\nsure I'm prepared.</color>
<color=#FF423F>This fight is important to\nMotoha... I should really\nbring her along.</color>
<color=#FF423F>A powerful foe...\nWe should be fully prepared\nbefore facing it.</color>
I should\n<color=#FF423F>observe carefully</color>here...
<color=#FF423F>A rather powerful foe.\nWe ought to be fully prepared\nbefore facing it.</color>
<color=#FF423F>That looks like a powerful\nfoe... If we're going to face\nit, we ought to be prepared...</color>
Just reading about his fight against\ninjustice, you could probably sense a bit\nof his heroic <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>.
Protecting his allies was his greatest source\nof pride... You can understand just how much\n<sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> he possessed.
After reading that story, you probably\nunderstand how much <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> they both had.
Just like Mandrin, this <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> will be\nuseful for our Phantom Thief business, hm?
After reading her tale, you must have a sense\nof Chiyome's expert <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>, right?
It's a good story, and it probably helped\nincrease your <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> as well, hm?
She has such unshakeable optimism. Perhaps\nyou've learned a bit about <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> as well?
It takes a lot of <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to never give up, no\nmatter how hopeless the situation. What do\nyou think?
Regardless of whether or not his sacrifice\nwas meaningful, you could really sense his\n<sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>, couldn't you?
After reading this book, I think you'll have\nmuch better <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> of the importance\nof human desires!
It was a bit much for me personally, but it\nreally took some <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color> to get through that.
It also said "preconceptions are\nmisdirections." Do you feel like you gained\nany <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> from that?
Perhaps your artistic sensibilities have\nimproved as well. Do you feel more like you've\ngained some <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>?
To help you survive in today's unforgiving\nsociety, you could learn a thing or two\nfrom this dog's <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color>.
But perhaps you've still learned about true\n<sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color> by seeing its opposite.
The <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> here should be useful\nin your work as a phantom thief.
Rising up against adversity takes a lot of\n<sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>. I'm sure you feel that within\nyourself as well.
What an inspiring story of overcoming\nhardship... Not only from Featherman, but the\nproduction staff had a lot of <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>.
That adaptability to unexpected situations\nshows <sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Proficiency</color> we should strive\nto emulate ourselves.
Right, I haven't given you my name. I'm <color=#FF423F>Yumi\nShiina</color>. And you are...?
There! That's <color=#FF423F>Atsushi Takayama</color>, right?
I'm already in a <color=#FF423F>relationship</color>\nwith another person...
Please bring me <color=#72C5FF>Jack Frost</color>.
I request a <color=#72C5FF>Jack Frost</color> with <color=#72C5FF>Lucky Punch</color>.

Oh, are you one of that <color=#ff0000>orange\ntabby's</color> friends?
My name is <color=#FF423F>Rikuto Shimizu</color>. I'm just an\naverage student who's really into\nphotography.
I'm <color=#FF423F>Yota Kurosawa</color>, a second year. As you\ncan see, I'm on the soccer team. What's your name?
I'm <color=#FF423F>Mamoru Kadota</color>, a second year. I know\nyou just joined and all...
Oh, I didn't introduce myself.\nI'm <color=#FF423F>Minami Miyashita</color>.
I remembered how much <sprite=6><color=#e6b625>Guts</color>\nit took not to give up\nback then...
...I wonder what kind of\n<sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color> others see in me.
I considered how to use my\n<sprite=4><color=#e6b625>Dexterity</color> to be even more\nefficient next time.
I can feel the <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>\nwelling up within me.
It's got a number on it... <color=#FF423F>62442</color>.\nDare we dial it?
If I'm not mistaken, it has something to do\nwith the <color=#FF423F>Shadow next to it</color>.
Let's <color=#FF423F>slam into it</color> with everything we've\ngot. Who knows, there may be something\nhidden inside!
<color=#FF423F>Slam into it</color> again!
Couldn't it be possible to <color=#FF423F>destroy</color> this too?
If we were to use this wind... We just might\nbe able to <color=#FF423F>fly to the other side</color>.
I believe we'll be able to <color=#FF423F>fly across</color> other\ncollapsed paths under the same circumstances.
A "Portable Energy Absorber"... It seems we\nshould be able to <color=#FF423F>absorb and release energy</color>\nwith this.
The <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color> ordered power generation\nto be set to full capacity. Some parts of the\ndam even had their power cut.
Thanks to that, we can't get out of here,\nand we can't do our jobs at the <color=#FF423F>Water\nTreatment Plant</color>.
They showed up with that <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color>.\nThey're obsessed with gathering energy.
This place is a mess... and we've got no\nidea where <color=#FF423F>Katayama-sama</color> has gone off to!
<color=#FF423F>Katayama-sama</color> should be at the Power Plant,\nwhere she works round the clock to generate\npower.
Also, this <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color> he mentioned...\nthat was Ms. Katayama, wasn't it?
That <color=#FF423F>new supervisor</color>... is terrifying... I'm\njust going to hide here! I'm not opening\nthat door for anything!
It's boiling in here... That <color=#FF423F>thermal energy</color>\njust keeps coming.
The Shadow from earlier mentioned something\nabout an <color=#FF423F>energy key</color>...
I see. It seems it operates using something\n<color=#FF423F>other than electric or thermal energy</color>.
That may be so, but if we want to get\nthat second <color=#FF423F>chain</color>, we have no choice\nbut to enter.
Let's continue after we obtain those <color=#FF423F>shields</color>.
We can move forward after we find those <color=#FF423F>weapons</color>.
We don't have enough <color=#FF423F>shields</color> yet, Wonder!
We still need to find more <color=#FF423F>weapons</color>, Wonder!
Wonder, let's go check the <color=#FF423F>Castle Gates</color>.
Don't worry about it! Just bust that\n<color=#FF423F>treasure chest</color> open!
If it's built the same way, can we get to\nthe second floor from <color=#FF423F>outside the gates</color>?
Just use that <color=#FF423F>box</color> to clear the way, Wonder.
The <color=#FF423F>ball</color> we're missing should be this way.\nOnward, Wonder!
There must be a <color=#FF423F>mechanism</color> to open this grate\nnearby. Let's find it.
The lever won't move... We'll need to find a\n<color=#FF423F>key</color> first.
Shall we <color=#FF423F>retrace our steps</color>? There may be a\n<color=#FF423F>locked</color> door back there.
There may be a <color=#FF423F>key</color> somewhere. Let's search.
I can hear voices below us... <color=#FF423F>Shall we take\na peek</color>?
<color=#FF423F>Intruders</color>...?
<color=#FF423F>Intruders</color>? Don't tell me...!
We can go down the elevator later. We need to\nfind the <color=#FF423F>balls</color> first.
First we need to find three <color=#FF423F>balls</color>. We can use\nthose to stop the <color=#FF423F>blade mechanism</color>.
We can't go down yet. Let's find the <color=#FF423F>balls</color>\nfirst.
I strongly anticipate that this "something"\nis one of those <color=#FF423F>baseballs</color> we're after.
There's a <color=#FF423F>ball</color> next to that statue!
Look, one of those strange <color=#FF423F>volleyballs</color>!
There should be more <color=#FF423F>volleyballs</color> around...
Wonder, you may be able to jump on top of the\n<color=#FF423F>wooden shelves</color> over there.
The <color=#FF423F>window</color> up above is open. We may be able\nto break in from there.
There should be a <color=#FF423F>switch</color> nearby. Let's look.
Why don't we use those <color=#FF423F>chandeliers</color> on the\nceiling to get there?
If we go in through the <color=#FF423F>window above the\ncastle gate</color>, we can get right on top of 'em!
Time to use your power of <color=#FF423F>observation</color>,\nWonder.
Well done, Wonder! Shall we open that <color=#FF423F>treasure\nchest</color> now?
The door is blocked by\na <color=#FF423F>grate</color>...
We can use the same method to lift this <color=#FF423F>grate</color>\nas we did the last one, Wonder.
But I don't see a way to remove the <color=#FF423F>lock</color> on\nthose chains...
Perhaps there's a <color=#FF423F>key</color> somewhere? Let's search\nfor one, Wonder.
I knew it! There's a <color=#FF423F>treasure chest</color> in here!
Wonder, go take out that <color=#FF423F>Shadow</color> and get\nthe key.
Shall we <color=#FF423F>enter</color>, Wonder?
Let's get on that elevator and go down to the\n<color=#FF423F>lower level of the tower</color>.
Especially this <color=#FF423F>portrait</color>...
The <color=#FF423F>portrait</color> stands out to me as well...\nWonder, let's take closer look.
This is an <color=#FF423F>important book</color>... Gotta\nprotect it.
Hmm... Important <color=#FF423F>books</color>?
That <color=#FF423F>important book</color> is ours for the taking!
I imagine moving the <color=#FF423F>right colors</color> to the\n<color=#FF423F>right locations</color> will cause something\nto occur.
There's a strange <color=#FF423F>button</color>\nhidden in the bookshelf...\nI should try pressing it.
We need to find a way into\nthe <color=#FF423F>second floor of the\nCentral Hall</color> first...
First we have to figure out\nhow to lift the <color=#FF423F>grate</color>\nat the end of the hall...
I need to find a <color=#FF423F>key</color> to\nremove those chains first...
We can get to the <color=#FF423F>lower level\nof the tower</color> from here...
We managed to get\nthe final <color=#FF423F>baseball</color>.
I got the <color=#FF423F>Vault KeyCard</color>...
Huh? Oh, yeah. Right. Just call me <color=#FF423F>Skull</color>!
That cat there's <color=#FF423F>Mona</color>.
That's right. This place may look like\n<color=#FF423F>Kamoshida's</color> Palace, but it sure isn't the\nreal deal.
Indeed... In that case, why don't we call it\na <color=#FF423F>Core</color>? For the time being, at least.
<color=#FF423F>Panther</color>? Hey, are you okay?
Oh, hey. Is <color=#FF423F>Joker</color> not with you?
It's at times like this when I really miss\nthe <color=#FF423F>chief's</color> coffee and curry...
More specifically, the one where Joker\ncrashes... Have you heard of <color=#FF423F>Caf\xe9 Leblanc</color>\nin Yongen?
I was afraid of this... It'll keep\nregenerating as long as the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> is\nstill intact.
I concur. We must neutralize the <color=#FF423F>Core</color> to\nprevent the shield from coming back.
The crown gave him a <color=#FF423F>shield</color>...! And he seems\nto have gotten stronger.
Breaking the <color=#FF423F>shield</color> might weaken him!
No way! He's healed!? Is it because the\n<color=#FF423F>Core</color>'s on his head?
Most likely... It appears we should neutralize\nthe <color=#FF423F>Core</color> first.
In that case, let me reintroduce myself!\nI'm <color=#FF423F>Morgana</color>, and this is...
<color=#FF423F>Ren Amamiya</color>. Nice to meet you.
Name's <color=#FF423F>Ryuji Sakamoto</color>. Nice to meetcha!\nYou can just call me Ryuji, don't sweat\nthe formalities.
Oh, you're... {NAME2}? It's nice to\nmeet you. I'm <color=#FF423F>Ann Takamaki</color>.
I am called <color=#FF423F>Yusuke Kitagawa</color>. Ren told me\nabout you, {NAME2}...
Nice to meet you, {NAME2}.\nI'm <color=#FF423F>Makoto Niijima</color>, this group's...\nmanager of sorts.
Y-Y-Y-You're here! I'm <color=#FF423F>Futaba Sakura</color>...\nJust call me Futaba!
Through watching Anne's\nexploits, I learned how to put\nmy <sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color> to good use.
His unwavering spirit must be the key\nto his <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>.
I learned that there are no\nshortcuts in the pursuit of\n<sprite=7><color=#e6b625>Knowledge</color>...
I realized that not even the\nworld's biggest ruby is more\nprecious than <sprite=8><color=#e6b625>Kindness</color>...
I respected the officer's\n<sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color> as he stayed\ntrue to his values...
I was inspired by the <sprite=5><color=#e6b625>Charm</color>\nof the protagonist as he\nwalked off into the sunset...

Think you've got what it takes to hit a\n<color=#FF423F>home run</color> in our training mode? Come on\nand give it your best shot!
I can't feel a thing! Unless you deal\n<color=#FF423F>continuous damage</color> in one turn, you'll\nnever win against me!
Guess I'm<color=#FF423F>Cu Chulainn</color> now...

<color=#FF423F>Ara Mitama</color> rules over <color=#FF423F>bravery</color>, <color=#FF423F>Nigi Mitama</color>\npresides over <color=#FF423F>intimacy</color>, <color=#FF423F>Saki Mitama</color> governs\n<color=#FF423F>love</color>, and <color=#FF423F>Kushi Mitama</color> commands <color=#FF423F>wisdom</color>.
<color=#FF423F>Bravery</color> is not lack of fear, but determination\nto move forward in spite of fear.
Many hymns are those of <color=#FF423F>bravery</color>! The\ngreatness of humanity is the greatness of\n<color=#FF423F>bravery</color>!
<color=#FF423F>Gentleness</color> is a virtue that nurtures the soul.
<color=#FF423F>Kindness</color> is creation, stronger than\ndestruction.
<color=#FF423F>Love</color> is the greatest teacher.

<color=#FF423F>Wisdom</color> is a virtue of the human soul.\nPhilosophy is <color=#FF423F>wisdom</color>'s lover.
I love the number <color=#FF423F>50</color>! If you can satisfy me,\nI'll give you something super cool.
Seems we need to <color=#FF423F>make a certain number reach\n50</color> or Thoth won't be satisfied.
Nice job! You reached <color=#FF423F>50</color>! I'll give you guys\nsomething super cool!
Hey now, you haven't reached <color=#FF423F>50</color> yet. Don't\ngive up, though!
That's still not <color=#FF423F>50</color>.
C'mon, that's not even close to <color=#FF423F>50</color>!\nGet it together!
You think this is anywhere near <color=#FF423F>50</color>?\nGet serious!
It looks like we can <color=#FF423F>adjust the numerical\nvalue</color> by attacking the shadows around Thoth.
Your opponents in each test will have <color=#FF423F>special\nabilities</color>. I advise you adjust your\nstrategy accordingly.
I've prepared <color=#FF423F>three goals</color> for each test.\nBe careful\u2014there are rewards on the line.
Something big is coming! We'd better\nget ready to <color=#FF423F>defend</color> ourselves!
I overheard the Shadows talking just now.\nThat must be the <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> they mentioned.
Nice try. That won't work on a <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>\nlike me.
So that's what a <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> is... There's no\nneed to panic though.
You should have just gotten a <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>\ncapable of dealing with this <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>.
If what the Shadows were saying is correct,\nit should be able to wipe out the <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color>.
To use it, you'll need to use the\n<color=#FF423F>Combat Chip</color>.
Each turn, the <color=#FF423F>Combat Chip</color> will\naccumulate <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>.
You'll need 20 Deployment Points to issue\nattack commands to the <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>.
First, quickly accumulate <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>,\nthen attack the <color=#FF423F>Pixie</color>.
Looks like you have some <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>,\nbut you'll need more. Go again, Wonder.
You appear to have enough <color=#FF423F>Deployment Points</color>\nnow. Attack with the <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color>!
The <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> went away, just like we planned.\nLet's finish it off while we still can.
The <color=#FF423F>Glitch</color> again, and with the same\napproach? How uninspired.
No matter. They're all the same.\nThe <color=#FF423F>Combat Drone</color> shall take care of it.
By using the <color=#FF423F>Self-Destruct Bots</color>, you can\nbreak through its defense.
This doesn't bode well... That last move\n<color=#FF423F>muddled</color> our allies.
As soon as possible, use an item or skill\nthat has a <color=#FF423F>status recovery</color> effect.
That <color=#FF423F>projector</color> is suspicious.\nThere must be trick to it.
Target those first! Once they're gone,\nwe can <color=#FF423F>limit Miyazawa's movement</color>.
Our allies have become Forgetful! Quickly,\nhave <color=#FF423F>Marian</color> use her <color=#FF423F>Healing Grace</color>\nto help them!
The enemy has locked on to us.\nHave <color=#FF423F>Fox</color> use his<color=#FF423F>Keen Eye</color> to\ndefend against the attack.
I won't let you have my <color=#FF423F>money</color>! No one\ncan have it... No one!
He summoned a guard... Looks like he's\nserious about protecting that <color=#FF423F>money</color>.
Huh? Did it drop something? Wait, is that\nthe <color=#FF423F>money</color> he was talking about?
Aghhh!\n<color=#FF423F>Money</color>... I need more <color=#FF423F>money</color>!
Huh? More <color=#FF423F>fake money</color>?

You were charged <color=#FFE900>%s</color> yen, so <color=#FFE900>%s</color> Cognition Crystals were returned.
<color=#EADE10></color>During the Phantom Thief trial period, the total amount charged (including through Marthym's Rewards Card, Premium Pass, Premium Pass +, and any direct Gift Pack purchases) will be returned at a rate of {1} {0} = 10 Cognition Crystals. The specific return range and rules are as follows:\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>400%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>300%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>200%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>150%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0}</color> or more: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>130%%</color>.
Even if {1}{0} were charged in the Phantom Thief Trial, a total of 92,625 Cognition Crystals will be returned after the release version starts. The return calculations are broken down as follows:\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0}  returned: (30\xd710 <color=#EADE10>400%%</color>) = 1200 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (170\xd710 <color=#EADE10>300%%</color>) = 5100 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (1800\xd710 <color=#EADE10>200%%</color>) = 3600 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (3000\xd710<color=#EADE10>150%%</color>) = 4500 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} or more returned: (415\xd710 <color=#EADE10>130%%</color>) = 5395 Cognition Crystals.\nTotal: 1200 + 5100 + 3600 + 4500 + 5395 = 92,695 Cognition Crystals
<sprite=0 tint=1>If a Marthym's Rewards Card was purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period, Cognition Crystals will be returned after the official release according to [Rule 1] based on the amount charged for the Marthym's Rewards Card. Marthym's Rewards Cards will also be returned based on the amount of Marthym's Rewards Cards purchased.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>Returns are limited to a maximum of <color=#EADE10>2</color> Marthym's Rewards Cards. If one Marthym's Rewards Card was purchased during the trial period, one Marthym's Rewards Card will be returned after the official release, and if two were purchased, two will be returned. If more than two Marthym's Rewards Card were purchased, only two will be returned; however, the amount charged <color=#EADE10>will count</color> toward the Cognition Crystal returns for [Rule 1].
For Phantom Passes purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period, Cognition Crystals will be returned after the official release based on the amount charged for Phantom Passes in accordance with [Rule 1]. Based on the charges, the player will also <color=#EADE10>receive the Phantom Pass items for free</color>.
<sprite=0 tint=1>During the trial period, Player A purchased a {1}{0} Premium Pass. As this {1}{0} <color=#EADE10>will be regarded as the amount charged</color>, Player A will have Cognition Crystals returned after release in accordance with [Rule 1], and receive a free Premium Pass.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>During the trial period, Player B used a {1}{0} Premium Pass and purchased a Premium Pass + for {1}{0}. As the amount charged equals <color=#EADE10>{1}{0}</color>, Player B will have Cognition Crystals returned after release in accordance with [Rule 1] and <color=#EADE10>receive a free</color> Premium Pass +.\n\nAbove are details on the Phantom Thief Trial Return Rules.
<color=#FFE900>Cognition Crystals, Marthym's Rewards Cards, Phantom Passes, and packs</color> purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period will be returned after the official release.

When a robot is following you, interact with them again to switch them to <color=#FF423F>inactive</color> mode.
There is <color=#FF423F>breakable glass</color> in the Palace. You can <color=#FF423F>attack</color> it to shatter it.
You can connect a robot carrying energy to an <color=#FF423F>Energy Transfer Device</color> by moving it near the device.\nSelect <color=#FF423F>Store Energy</color> to store the energy in the device.
By transmitting energy through the <color=#FF423F>Energy Conduction Pole</color>, you can connect to another Energy Transfer Device.
You can connect a robot with no energy to an <color=#FF423F>Energy Transfer Device</color> to receive energy.\nIf both of them have energy, an <color=#FF423F>Energy Exchange</color> will occur.
<color=#FF423F>Flying robots</color> may steal the energy carried by other robots.\nBy storing the energy in a different device, you can avoid being targeted by flying robots.
By <color=#FF423F>rotating</color> the Energy Conduction Pole, the direction of energy transmission can be changed to different devices.
An <color=#FF423F>error</color> will occur if the Energy Collection Device's <color=#FF423F>emission ends are facing each other</color>, or if <color=#FF423F>two energy lines are entered</color>.\nFix the rotation to correct it.
Some doors in the Palace are operated with a different kind of <color=#FF423F>Energy Absorption Device</color>. You will need to provide the correct type of energy to open the door.
By using the <color=#FF423F>Robot Control Panel</color>, you can switch to the robot's view and operate it.
Robots can pass through the <color=#FF423F>Electric Barrier Door</color>.\nBy accessing the <color=#FF423F>Authentication Switch</color>, the corresponding Electric Barrier Door can be disabled.
From the operation view, you can <color=#FF423F>access other devices</color>.
The first person to play all the cards in their hand is the winner.\nIn <color=#FF423F>Classic</color> mode, play a match against the CPU.\nIn <color=#FF423F>Ranked Match</color>, play 3 fixed rounds against a matched opponent.
In Tycoon, a card's number will decide its strength.\nThe <color=#FF423F>weakest card is 3</color>, continuing upwards to 4, 5 and so on. The <color=#FF423F>strongest card is 2</color>.
The turn order proceeds clockwise.\nWhen you play cards, they must be <color=#FF423F>the same number of cards</color> and a <color=#FF423F>higher rank</color> than the previous player.\nIf you can't play any cards, or choose not to, you can <color=#FF423F>Pass</color> and skip your turn.
The player holding the <color=#FF423F>3 of diamonds</color> will go first. From there, the Beggar begins the round.
At the start of the second round, players may <color=#FF423F>exchange cards</color>.
Playing a 3 of Spades after a single Joker card will trigger a <color=#FF423F>3-Spade Reversal</color> and end the round.
Playing 4 of the same rank triggers a <color=#FF423F>Revolution</color>, reversing the strength of all cards.
If you play another 4 of a kind when a Revolution is active, it triggers a <color=#FF423F>Counter Revolution</color>, returning all cards' strength to normal.
The Joker is stronger than a 2, or stronger than a 3 during a Revolution. It can also be played as a wild card in place of other numbers.\nIf you play it as pictured here, it will become a <color=#FF423F>Revolution</color>.
When you play <color=#FF423F>Wonder</color>, you can activate an <color=#FF423F>X Stop</color>, instantly ending the round regardless of the other cards played.
If the Tycoon is not able to maintain their status during the next round, that player will lose the round and <color=#FF423F>become the Beggar</color>.
When you invite an accomplice to visit your Thieves Den, you will gain Visitor EXP over time.\nAs you gain experience, your <color=#FF423F>Visitor Level</color> with them will increase.
