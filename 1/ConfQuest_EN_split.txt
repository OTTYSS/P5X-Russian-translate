Apparently a new cat has moved into Zoshigaya recently.\nIf I have time, I should go and look for them.
Apparently the tabby hasn't been seen for some time.\nMaybe the nearby residents or shopkeepers might know something about it. Time to put on my detective hat and ask around.

Motoha said to meet her at Central Street in Shibuya.\nI'd better hurry up and find her.
Motoha sent me the address of the clinic.\nI'll go there after school.
Motoha suspects Kano has gone after Miyazawa.\nWe need to stop him before he does anything reckless.
Motoha talked to the police, but their response wasn't helpful...
Motoha used the Metaverse Navigator while we were on the train.\nHopefully that isn't a problem...
Motoha used the mysterious app, and then...
Motoha was called by Ms. Katayama. I guess I have to look for Kano by myself.

See how he's doing.
See Motoha and Tomoko

Seeing Akashi's past helps to understand why he's been doing all these things, but it's still no excuse for the harm he caused.\nLet's keep searching deeper and see what else we can find.
Seems like I'm getting a call. I should pull out my phone and see who it is.
Seems like there's a few steps involved in getting this door open.

Shichi-kun hasn't had to silently take any more beatings after Shadow Yamazaki disappeared.\nLet's go back to Shibuya and check on Shichi-kun.
Shichi-kun is attracting tourists
Shichi-kun is keeping quiet despite getting badly bullied. He even asked me to keep it a secret. Why doesn't he say anything? It looks like the bully dropped something. Maybe I should pick it up.
Shichi-kun won't talk. Something is definitely off...\nI should ask the nearby shop staff about Shichi-kun.
Shichi-kun's lips are sealed. Let's go to the store in Shibuya to see what's going on.

Shimizu seems pretty upset. I should go buy some super rich green tea from a vending machine for him.
Shimizu thinks that there might be some customers wearing interesting rain gear at the flower shop.\nLet's head over there and see what we find.
Shimizu wasn't satisfied with that shoot either. Let's head to the next spot.

Two customers started complaining outside Kageyama's store, but we managed to calm them down.\nKageyama said that she would handle the situation, so I'll leave it to her, and wait for her to contact me later.
Unfortunately what we shot at the flower shop doesn't quite fit the theme of "taking shelter from the rain."\nLet's head to the other entrance of the mall and see what else we can find.

We arrived at Kichijoji.\nLet's get in touch with Riko-senpai.
We can control the robot to open the door.
We can convert energy with the device and open the locked doors.
We can cut the cable on the core to open the door.
We can discuss what to do next after we return to Shibuya.
We can get into the Palace through the ventilation shaft.
We can operate the giant fan from the control room upstairs. Let's head up there.
We can pull the lever to activate the first device.
We can pull the lever to activate the second device.
We can pull the lever to open the locked door.
We can turn off the lights and evade the Shadows' attacks.
We can use the computer to lower the workbench and get another chip.
We can use the control device to open the doors in the area.
We can use the device to change the flow of steam and open up the path.
We can use the device to open the control room doors.
We can use the energy device to open the door.
We can use the robot to turn off the light blocking our way.
We defeated Miyazawa and he returned to his original form.
We discussed the matter of desires in the car.
We don't have a full grasp of the palace yet.\nLet's keep exploring its interior.
We don't have any way to operate the power supply right now. There must be some way to get it running...
We ended up in this peculiar place again, but they're bound to show up here, too.
We finally found the robot. We can use it to open the door.
We found Miyazawa's Palace, but we can't go inside until we find some more clues.\nI'll go home for now and think things over.
We found the second projector.\nIf we watch what's on it, maybe the second chain will return to normal.
We found the third projector.\nIf we watch what's on it, maybe the third chain will return to normal.
We got away from that strange figure, so let's go back to Shibuya and discuss what to do.
We had a great meal today, so now let's think a bit more about what's going on with Ms. Katayama...
We have the chain now.\nIf we take it to a mechanic, we can repair the main exhaust fan.
We have to be close.\nFind out where the Shadows of Miyu's parents are hiding.
We led the robot to the charging device, but unfortunately it didn't have enough energy...
We made it inside the Palace. Let's continue searching for Ms. Katayama.
We made it to a new area, but something doesn't feel right...
We made it to the generator room, but the door is locked.\nThere must be a way to open it.
We managed to get some good material this time, linking umbrellas with traditional culture.\nLet's see how the show is received tomorrow.
We managed to infiltrate Akashi's palace.\nNow, let's see what we can find inside...
We meet again.
We met Ms. Katayama at the edge of the dam...
We need three chains to repair the main exhaust fan.\nLet's start looking for the first one.
We need to find 3 robots before we can turn off the lights.\nLet's go find the first robot.
We need to find a robot to activate the charging device.
We need to put a stop to Takeyuki Kiuchi as soon as we can.\nLet's enter that red vortex and head to Kiuchi's Palace.\nTap the Metaverse icon, select Kiuchi's Palace, and go to Baseball Stadium Main Entrance.
We need to set the energy to the correct direction.
We repaired the first chain.\nNext, let's find the second chain.
We repaired the second chain.\nLet's hurry and look for the third chain.
We should activate that disabled robot.
We should continue deeper into the dam and search for clues about the Palace.
We should go to the Path of Chemdah Area 1 and look for clues to the Palace.
We should head to the Path of Chemdah.
We should keep exploring Akashi's Palace.\nWe might be able to find more of his memories.
We should look around and see if we can find something.
We should open the iron gate to make a path for the robot.
We should see if there's another route besides the main entrance.
We should take a look at the computer in this room. Maybe we'll find something useful.
We solved the puzzle, and got the big door open.\nLet's keep going.
We still don't have a full grasp of Katayama's Palace.\nWe should keep exploring inside.
We successfully changed the hearts of Miyu's parents.\nLet's see what they do next.
We took down a tough enemy.\nTime for a quick break in the Safe Room.
We were able to get some powerful weaponry.\nThat much was a success, but we're running low on funds now...
We'll need to get past plenty of obstacles before we can take the Treasure.\nWe should proceed with caution.
We'll use the device to convert enegy, activate the elevator, and then head onwards.
We're exploring deeper into the depths of Mementos,\nbut the path ahead seems blocked.
We're getting close to the goal.\nBetter proceed carefully.
We're getting closer to the Treasure.\nLet's head further inside.
We've all returned to Shibuya. After a brief discussion, Riko said she had thought of a way to deliver the calling card.
We've already located the first robot, and we're off to a great start.\nLet's continue searching for the next one.
We've been unexpectedly pulled into a battle. Let's take down these enemies.
We've confirmed the target. Let's get ready, then head to Mementos.
We've ended up somewhere dangerous.\nI should find a way out with Lufel.
We've entered a new area.\nWill we be able to find some new leads here?
We've finished our preparations, so let's head into Mementos.
We've infiltrated the dam.\nNow let's search for the treasure.
We've opened up a new area.\nThis place seems to have some influence on the real world as well.\nFirst, let's look for clues.
We've sent the calling card.\nI wonder how Miyazawa will react...
We've solved the problems in two rooms already. Let's keep going and find out what's wrong with the last one.
We've somehow arrived in the Metaverse, but what exactly is going on?
Well, the first interview didn't go so great, but we can't throw in the towel that quickly. Let's find the next person to interview.
What are you doing...?
What could be in the book?\nLet's investigate Hinokuniya Bookstore in Shinjuku.
What could be on the coupon?\nLet's investigate the sushi restaurant in Kichijoji.
What could be on the receipt?\nLet's investigate the convenience store in Shibuya.
What did you want to tell me?
What do you want to do most?
What's news?
What's the plan?
Where'd they go?
While passing through Shibuya, I remembered that today is Sato's performance review. I wonder how he's doing. I'll just have to wait and see.
Why are you standing in the rain?
Why did a projector appear in the Palace?\nWe need to investigate this.
Win the battle
Win your first battle
With the power I've gained, I'll defeat the enemies before me.
Witness Akashi's past
Witness Miyazawa's confession
Witness someone getting pushed
Witness the capture

Yakitori to Go
Yamagoshi has recovered, and made a ton of great food for us.\nI'm totally satisfied.
Yamagoshi was taken away in an ambulance.\nRight now, we should talk with Kano.
Yuta Sato and I will go to the outdoor caf\xe9 in Kichijoji and look for the workplace specialist Daisato-san.
Yuta Sato asked me to pretend to be his boss so he could practice the art of buttering up. Time to churn up that flattery.
Yuta Sato called me in the middle of the birthday party. He wants me to tell him what he should do and say.
Yuta Sato is going to his boss's birthday party today. I should take his call.
Yuta Sato is once again standing nervously in the backstreets of Zoshigaya. Let's ask if something happened.
Yuta Sato is standing nervously in the backstreets of Zoshigaya.\nI should ask if he needs help.
Yuta Sato is telling me what he heard at the office...
