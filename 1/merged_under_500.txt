=== desc ===
An abnormality with the Metaverse Navigator sent the Phantom Thieves to a strange castle.\nAs they continued in a daze, they faced an unexpected encounter.
The Phantom Thieves encountered two unfamiliar Thieves, Mona and Skull, and established an alliance with them.\nSkull had been to this castle before, but it didn't seem like it had been a positive experience for him.
The Phantom Thieves continued pushing forward and exploring the area.\nThe interior of the castle could hardly be described as being in good taste.
Compared to Kiuchi's Palace, the castle is filled with dark corridors and disturbing rooms.\nCloser seems to feel uncomfortable here...
Working together to beat back the Shadows, the Phantom Thieves fought their way to the underground prison.\nThere, they came across a lost teammate confined to a cell.
Panther joined her allies and the search for the Core continued.\nTheir final missing teammate, Joker, is still missing. Just where could he be?
The Phantom Thieves backtracked to a certain room at the castle's west end.\nPanther seemed to have some bad memories of that room.
In an area called the Training Hall of Love, the Phantom Thieves witnessed the unfair treatment of a cognitive being.\nWhile there, Closer spotted a familiar face.
The Phantom Thieves find themselves in dire straits as they are suddenly attacked by a strong Shadow.\nLuckily, they still had an ace up their sleeve.
With Joker's return, all allies had finally assembled.\nThe Phantom Thieves set out once more in pursuit of the Core.
Countless traps await the Phantom Thieves on their path to the Core.\nThey must combine their power in order to overcome the difficulties that lie ahead.
The Phantom Thieves, exhausted from the continuous campaign of battles and exploration, decide they might need to take a short rest.
After their rest, the Phantom Thieves began a search for the third ball.\nAlthough they hoped for a quick job, things didn't appear to be that simple.
The Phantom Thieves have finally arrived at the heart of the castle.\nCan they successfully steal the Core...?
The Metaverse Navigator has produced another anomaly. This time, the Thieves have been taken to a place resembling some sort of museum... will they encounter "them" again?
After entering the museum, the Phantom Thieves encountered Panther and Fox. It seems that once again, they have been separated from their teammates. In exchange for searching for each other's lost allies, the two groups of Thieves entered into an alliance. During this time, Lufel seemed to grow curious about something.
During the search for their teammates, Fox turned his attention to a painting hung on the wall of the museum. This place seems to resemble a certain Palace, one with which he and the owner shared a deep connection.
The Phantom Thieves head toward the second exhibition room. The museum's inner security seems to be very tight...
The Phantom Thieves continue their search for the Core as they slip past various security measures. What awaited them ahead was...
Although the Thieves successfully acquired the Core, there seems to be one more Core reading left. In order to obtain the remaining Core, the Phantom Thieves ventured further within the museum.
The Phantom Thieves head toward the security room in order to find the road leading outside of the art museum. The patrolling Shadows and security measures are not to be taken lightly.
Just as the Phantom Thieves were about to reach the museum exit, an unexpected obstacle blocked their path. Can they put their heads together to overcome this unanticipated challenge?
The Core's presence is rapidly growing closer. The exit is within reach.
The Phantom Thieves finally left the museum. There, they came across something most unexpected...
The Thieves arrived at a building closely resembling Kaneshiro's Palace. No one could hide their disgust at the unsightly scene brimming with greed.\nIn front of the palace, they found the formerly lost Closer, who was accompanied by another reliable new teammate.
A flurry of banknotes was scattered all throughout the Palace.\nIf only it was all real... Each of the Thieves imagined the limitless possibilities.
The Core must be hidden somewhere within the bank's underground.\nThe Phantom Thieves continue searching the depths for a route forward.
Aside from patrolling Shadows, various tricks and traps hindered the Thieves' path.\nTo obtain the Core, their only option was to persevere and continue onward.
As Shadows close in, the Phantom Thieves find themselves in a dire position.\nHowever, their luck turns around thanks to an unexpected visitor.
Facing greater dangers, the Phantom Thieves continue the exploration.\nThe next destination has been decided: the underground vault.
The Phantom Thieves have arrived in front of the vault.\nSkull suggested holding a planning meeting before attempting to enter.
The exploration of the vault has begun.\nIn addition to traps and tricks, powerful Shadows lie in wait for the Phantom Thieves.
The presence of the Core grows closer.\nIt looks like the final destination of this journey will lead to the very heart of the vault.
After great tribulation, the Phantom Thieves have finally arrived at the Core.\nCan they defeat the perilous final Shadow that awaits, and steal the resplendent Core?
Due to a Metaverse Navigator error, the Thieves once again appeared in an unexpected place.\nWhile standing in bewilderment at the vast desert wasteland before them, they heard a voice calling for help.
While traversing the desert with Oracle, the Phantom Thieves arrived at a pyramid, where they once again encountered Queen and Fox.\nWhile delighted at the reunion, it seems other allies are still unaccounted for.
As the Phantom Thieves continued into the pyramid's underground area, they came across Panther and Skull.\nHowever, upon seeing the joyous reunion between Closer and Panther, Oracle suddenly felt pain...
In the Chamber of Rejection, it seems that not just enemies, but traps and gimmicks, lie in wait for the Thieves.\nSharp wits, in addition to raw strength, will be required in order to push forward.
As the Phantom Thieves continue inward, they encounter a strange mural of a snake.\nIt seems the mural in the original Palace was different, but what could that mean...
Continuing from the snake, the Thieves happen upon a mural of a chicken.\nWhile pondering its meaning, a portion of Oracle's past is brought to light.
Facing stronger enemies as they continue inward, the present path grows dangerous.\nThe Thieves must find the right path, all while fending off Shadows.
The Phantom Thieves come across yet another peculiar mural.\nAt first glance, the animals in it don't seem to be connected at all... But then, a look of realization appears on Navi's face.
As the Core's presence grows stronger, large numbers of traps and gimmicks hinder the path ahead.\nCan the Thieves unite to overcome these obstacles?
After overcoming many trials, the Phantom Thieves have finally arrived at the Core.\nWaiting for them was an enormous enemy far beyond their expectations.
As the members of the Phantom Thieves gathered, they had no trouble mingling with one another.\nThe newly-joined Noir seemed a little bit nervous at the current situation. After seeing her disposition, Joker took action...
The structure of the spaceportesque False Palace was complex, teeming with various obstacles to the Phantom Thieves' exploration. Channeling all of the knowledge and experience they had gained up to this point, they utilized the facilities within the spaceport and slowly began to make their way through.
As the Phantom Thieves began to acclimate to exploration, more and more Shadows stood in their path. Fighting useless battles is a waste of time and energy. Sharp situational judgment will be the key to success.
Noir's mood darkened when she looked upon the robots forced to work like slaves.\nWind, who had experienced similar circumstances, empathized with Noir.\nDespite it all, the two now have each other, as well as close allies, to support them along the way.
The Thieves find themselves hampered by the base's security system.\nThey need to find a shadow with an Employee ID bearing special access permissions. Even for Shadows of the Metaverse, it seems the shackles of hierarchical society cannot be so easily broken.
By pure coincidence, the two groups of Phantom Thieves noticed a difference between their respective realities. They were perplexed by the possibility of the existence of parallel worlds...
Oracle's mind returned to the parallel worlds situation.\nWas the meeting of the two groups of Thieves really a product of coincidence? Who could have intentionally set up such an encounter? It seems that they may need to shed light on the truth themselves.
A vast vacuum of space surrounded the False Palace.\nThe only way to the Core was directly across the dark void. Even the Phantom Thieves couldn't help but feel a touch of uneasiness at the prospect.
After leaping through space, the Phantom Thieves arrived at the final area.\nThe location of the Core is only a small step away. Although they were greeted by powerful Shadows and all manner of obstacles, they continued their advance toward their goal.
The Phantom Thieves face off against the Core's guardian at the spaceport's deepest point.\nIn the middle of the battle, the enemy shouted all manner of mysterious words.\nJust what could these utterances mean...

Very soon the demon of terror will come knocking at the door. It waits in the darkness, setting traps to lead the world to temptation.
With a healthy environment and proper care, vibrant new life will be able to sprout.
Struggling forward along the path, carrying a great weight alone. Even when defeat seems inevitable, there is still hope ahead.
Jumping into the murky depths, no matter what dangers lie beneath the surface. Summon the courage to chase your desires, never faltering.
A castle may rise up in your dreams in just one night, but you must gather the stones to build it after you awake.
With staff in hand, he protects his steadfast beliefs and demonstrates his own sense of justice.
The sharp sword pierced through the still-beating heart. But now the blood is drying, and the wound will heal.
In the midst of the chaos, he raises his weapon. He focuses his mind, defeats the monstrous foes, and raises his voice high.
When nothing changes, people will soon grow bored... But as the sun rises in the east, new opportunities quietly arrive.
Receiving God's gracious blessings, happiness and joy create a garden of beautifully blooming flowers.
Whether the future is good or ill, accepting all of your imperfections is the only way to move forward.
A sincere wish that the world will be free from violence and strife, and that peace will finally come.
As pain washes over you and you fight to catch your breath, will you be able to ride out the storm?
Intense desires are finally calmed by the serene beauty all around. Amidst the incredible sense of relief, calamity looms beyond the ramparts.
Draped in finery, tension is finally released as we dance to a soft melody in the moonlight.
An ever-evolving source of power courses through the body. It invigorates your fearless spirit and creates new life.
The winds and waves are ever-changing, but they will not consume you if you simply readjust your course.
Drowning in a beautiful dream both day and night, but cruel reality threatens to swallow you up. You must wake up soon.
The laurel-crowned warrior returns in glory. All the pain and suffering of the past is reduced to dust amidst the triumphant cheers.
When the path is lost beneath entangled desires, the light of reason can cut through the fog and dispel the shadows.
The black current gradually recedes, and light appears on the horizon. Fears and doubts will be lifted with the coming dawn.
In a world of fairy tales, there is no sadness, only pure joy and beauty. Savor it while it lasts.
Hesitation will only hinder your progress. Listen to your heart, take hold of your fate, and seize victory.
The foggy path is choked with vines, and demons whisper to lead travelers astray. When will this curse be lifted?
The lion bathed in intense flames stretches its body. A joyous melody is heard and the light appears.
The fog is now lifted, and the scenery before our eyes becomes bathed in light. The true world is finally here.
When one can truly understand their own heart and know the place where they belong, they will find what it is they've been looking for.
A seedling sprouts from the soil, and the roots spread out deep. New life grows unfettered.
Take your desires in hand and form them into a spear, piercing through the dark clouds that obscure the truth.
Spread your wings and soar into the sky. Your mind is free from doubts, and you are simply heading toward the end of the journey.
The golden fields are bathed in sunlight. A knight in black armor lifts his weary head and gazes into the distance.
White lotus flowers bloom out of the mud. Seedlings buried too long in the darkness always yearn for the sky.
Shed the old shell of desire and reach out with both hands toward love and new life. Then you can spread your wings toward dreams of tomorrow.
When the spring arrives, the greenery returns of its own accord. At the end of the journey, the heart will be at peace.
Over towering mountains and across rushing waters, no obstacle can stand in your way.
The sharp blade will never stop swinging. A fearless fighting spirit will cut through any chains that try to bind it.
The fierce flames roar and rage, engulfing everything until silence returns and a gentle light shines through.
She escapes from her prison, her pure white skirt fluttering. Each graceful step brings her toward freedom.
Rise on the wings of intuition and imagination. The noble steed raises its head, galloping toward dreams and the future, a path enveloped in light and hope.
Your voice echoes alone through the dense fog. Away from the clamor of the world outside, uncover your inner truths, and your heart will come to know its true form.

Together they can form an effective team.
Phantom Thieves who share the same Attribute can create a Flames of Desire effect, boosting the stats of the whole party. Kamiyama can boost his teammates' Attack and critical damage, making Makoto especially more effective.
Yumi specializes in granting buffs to the entire party. She can also increase the effectiveness of specific damage attributes, so if you include multiple Phantom Thieves with the same attribute in the party, Phoebe's buffs will be maximized.
Ayaka can enhance the effects of her allies' Highlight skills. She's an effective partner for characters with powerful Highlights, since she can boost their damage and instantly activate their Highlight.

I am Merope, your concierge. Please remember me from now on.
The Velvet Room exists between dreams and reality, mind and matter. I am merely a servant of its master.
In order to avoid the impending ruin, I will assist you in strengthening your desires.
Our relationship...? I am to devise a special contract for you to fulfill. Are you seeking a different kind of relationship?
My upper body strength...? It wouldn't be difficult to demonstrate, but I'll leave it to your imagination.
Please be aware that I cannot provide any more information about my master than what you currently know.
A rising idol with a knack for character creation, meeting her was truly a blessing. Please look forward to the next special contract I prepare for you.
I'm Motoha Arai. My codename is Closer. Nice to meet you again!
Me? Hmmm... I guess I tend to follow my gut. But maybe that also means I might not be great at thinking things through. Ahaha...
I need to get back in shape for running around in the Metaverse. But I worked pretty hard today, so I can have just one cr\xeape, right? That's fine, right?
If I hadn't met you, I might've been stuck in the past forever. Thank you again. Let's keep doing our best together!
Only the Phantom Thieves can change the hearts of people with twisted desires, right? I'll do my best. I want to help the people who've been hurt like Tomoko was.
I've gotten used to him and all, but I still don't really understand where Lufel came from. Why would the Metaverse have owls?
Tomoko is my closest friend. We've been battery mates since little league, and she's always there for me whenever I'm having a hard time. I want to be there for her forever too. We're not just friends, we're besties!
My name is Lufel. Codename: Cattle. Remember it.
Sorry, but I don't make a habit of talking about myself. What? Don't look so sad! I'll tell you someday.
My memory is currently incomplete. I understand the way to regain it is to steal the distorted desires, otherwise known as Treasure, from Palace rulers.
We are business partners working together as members of the Phantom Thieves. Hoohoo, you know, your bag is quite comfortable by the way.
The Phantom Thieves of desires... I have entrusted you with the role of leader while I focus on my own objectives.
Clinging to past glories, blaming others for his fallen circumstances, and continually oppressing the weak with his twisted lust. If he continues to go unchecked, more victims will certainly emerge. He is a perfect candidate for the Phantom Thieves' first target.
It was a pleasant surprise to discover another Persona-user besides us. Although her somewhat loud personality may not be a perfect fit for our covert operations, she is certainly a valuable asset in battle.
Shun Kano. But around here, you can call me Soy.
Am I... hard to approach? I guess I feel that way now and then. It's not that I hate talkin' to people or anything, though.
I believe in pursuing the perfect flavor. That's how it's always been, and it won't change anytime soon.
Come to think of it, before I became a phantom thief, I saw you a few times on the rooftop. Didn't look like you were there to eat... What were you doing up there?
I never thought I'd be a phantom thief. If Pops knew, he'd flip.
I mean, he's a talking owl... Of course I was surprised. But I see him as a fellow phantom thief now. Guess he can be a bit uppity at times, though.
Huh? That came outta nowhere... She's not aimin' to be a chef, but she's still got a pretty darn impressive sense of taste. And, y'know... She's a lot more personable and friendly than me.
Kiyoshi Kurotani. Codename: Key. It's not "Ki" like Kiyoshi, it's "Key" as in "lock and key," okay?
What makes me the chosen one? You've met me, isn't it obvious?
It's not a question of "can" I do it, it's a question of "will" I.
Seeing as we are fellow chosen ones, feel free to consult with me about anything, okay?
Someday, my life's tale may become a book that's passed down through generations... I live every day with that possibility in mind.
When it comes to Take-kun, I just can't turn a blind eye...
My name's Yaoling Li! I'm from Sichuan, China. Nice to meet you!
I'm still not great at Japanese... I'm always making tons of mistakes. Just be patient with me, okay? Xi\xe8xi\xe8!
I could've just kept studying back home in China, but my mom and dad thought it'd be better for me to study abroad... I'm still trying to understand why they wanted me to come here, but they must have had their reasons.
The whole thing that "people from Sichuan love spicy food" is just a stereotype, you know! But... I do think Japanese food could be better with a little spice.
Sensei, you've not only been my guide around Tokyo, but you've also helped me understand what studying abroad is all about... You're not just my Tokyo tour guide, you're like an "entire life" guide!
Yukimi-san seems like she's really been held back by always following the rules, like she can't express herself... Me, on the other hand, I just do whatever I want... Eh, maybe "I'm free-spirited" sounds better?
Are you interested in Chinese tea, Sensei? If you've got some time, I can teach you! Hehe, this time it's my turn to be your Sensei, huh?
I'm Tomoko Noge. Nice to meet you.
Talent? I don't think I have anything I'm really good at. Sometimes I worry about how I should live my life without baseball.
Giving up baseball was tough, but it might have given me a chance to find myself. Don't worry, I won't give up searching!
I used to be a catcher. Huh? I don't look like one?
Isn't it fun working lots of part-time jobs together? Thanks for always giving me advice. I'm counting on you!
Motoha is really popular. She's earnest, kind, and great at sports... though she can be a little lax at times. I'm proud to call her my best friend!
Kano-kun? Yeah, he's in my class. He's always got this serious look on his face.
What's up? I'm Kayo Tomiyama! So, what're you kids into these days?
Yeah, I was a pretty big star when I was younger! Even worked as a stylist, you know! And I'm still majorly picky when it comes to fashion.
I may be an adult in terms of age, but I'm still young at heart, as they say! But the youth culture of today is totally different... Time really does fly.
Do you like my fashion sense? Oh, those clothes I gave you were just sample pieces my hubby got from work. Don't worry about it! But I can guarantee they're all high-quality!
When I talk to you, it's like going back to my younger days... Huh? Shut up! You're totally harshing my vibe... Just kidding.
Whenever I see that kid, I just feel like cheering him on. He's just so much like me when I was younger, I guess.
Gah, you're asking about him all of a sudden? Well, come to think of it... You remind me a lot of him when he was younger!
My name's Yui! If you've got any questions about the virtual world, ask away!
You want to know more about me? Well... I am who I am! What you see is what you get! If you don't believe me, just look for yourself!
I want to get a huge plot of land, grow lots of tasty things, and eat until I'm full to burst!
Well, Russet, you're a pretty mysterious guy, you know? Whenever we're together, I always end up saying too much about myself...
Farm work requires two things: physical stamina and love! You've got to work hard to till the soil, and give it plenty of nutrients and love, and then you'll have some great crops!
Not long ago, it was just packed full of people, but lately it's been a little lonely. But now, thanks to Russet and our farm, I'm not lonely at all anymore!
Come to think of it, my friend Musubi's name is written with the same kanji as mine, so you could read it as "Yui." Ehehehe... Isn't it fun that we match?
Hello, I'm Ayaka Sakai. We met in front of Shibuya Station.
What I'm good at, huh... A lot of people have told me I'm good at playing guitar. But I feel like I still have a long way to go.
Well, I... My voice... I'd really like to share my songs. That's my number-one goal.
My high school memories... Well, I definitely remember putting together a band with my friends. Everyone worked so hard on our songs, and we practiced so much to put on a concert... It really was fun.
Thanks for always being there for me. As long as you're here, I... Sorry, nevermind.
"Make both of our dreams come true"... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still worried about that. But... I'm going to do what I can.
I want to keep on singing. For my friends, who showed me how much fun it could be, and for all the people who love my songs. And... for you, too.
I'm Yumi Shiina. I work as a bartender in Shibuya, and my specialty is flair bartending! Nice to meet you.
I was in a dance club back in college, and we did all sorts of dances. I think that's really helped me with my flair bartending. It's kinda like... a step only I can take.
Yeah, bars can be pretty intimidating, can't they? A lot of people say they're nervous about coming in. But I'd like it to be a place where people feel welcome anytime! That's why I've been practicing mocktails, you know?
The flavor, color, and all different things come together in a single glass. It's like magic, don't you think? And on top of that, the shape of the glass and the color of the decorations can change the impression, too. You've gotta be a real magician to make the perfect drink for each customer, and that's what I want to be.
I'll never forget the feeling of leaping across the stage, the way my costume sparkled under the spotlight... It was just so much fun! ...I wish that fun could've lasted forever.
Your mocktail-mixing skills are getting better every day... I can't let myself lose! The apprentice must not surpass the master! Just you wait, my next drink is going to knock your socks off!
I think about it once in a while. If I'd never met you... I definitely wouldn't enjoy dancing anymore, let alone flair bartending... Because of you, I've been having a lot of fun lately. So, thanks.

Faithful servant to the master of the Velvet Room, Igor. As part of her master's orders, she acts as {NAME2}'s personal concierge to oversee the strengthening of his desire, and offers support to the Phantom Thieves from the sidelines.
Under orders from Igor, Merope is tasked with finding a way to support {NAME2} in the real world. A chance encounter leads to her arriving upon a rather unconventional solution...
As {NAME2}'s concierge, Merope must come up with an effective way to support him. She proposes a special contract, through which she hopes to better understand him.
Merope believes that harnessing multiple Personas is not unlike the many faces that idols must wear. Thus, she insists that {NAME2} must study the path of the idol.
At Merope's enthusiastic behest, {NAME2} replicates the poses of an idol. Upon doing so, Merope is convinced of his potential.
Merope invites {NAME2} out to Akihabara, the holy land of idols, under the pretense that he will be able to study idols more closely there.
Merope sees a glimmer of potential in Narumi Nashimoto, an indie idol she encounters in Akihabara, and suggests paying a visit to the concept caf\xe9 Narumi works at\u2014purely for the sake of studying idols, of course.
So {NAME2} and Merope can get the full concept caf\xe9 experience, they go and attend Narumi's photo shoot\u2014at first to study idols, but...
As Merope grows acquainted with Narumi, she learns of the corrupt producer exploiting the idols of the caf\xe9...
Merope pays another visit to Narumi's caf\xe9 and is pleased to see that the producer has had a complete change of heart. With Narumi back to her cheerful self and working happily again, she gives Merope a special gift...
Merope and {NAME2} prepare diligently for the fan appreciation event. As she observes {NAME2}'s idol cheer, something stirs within Merope...
A second-year high school student at Kokatsu Academy, and {NAME2}'s classmate. She is skilled at sports, and very popular at school. However, she tends to rely more on intuition than logic, so her grades aren't exactly the greatest.
Motoha has realized that she's not as fit as she used to be when she was playing baseball. So in order to prepare for their Phantom Thief activities, she decides to start training again, and asks {NAME2} to be her coach.
Ever since Kiuchi retired from baseball, Motoha has been neglecting her batting practice. Hoping to pull herself out of her slump, she heads to the batting cages in Yongen-Jaya.
Motoha and {NAME2} head to the sports gym in Shibuya as part of her training. As the two of them work up a sweat, Motoha mentions that she's in a better mood than before.
{NAME2} accompanies Motoha to the diner in Shibuya as she indulges herself on her cheat day, in preparation for tomorrow's training.
With some quality training under her belt, Motoha makes her return to the batting cages, where she encounters Tamayo Yoshida, an old rival from her baseball days. Tamayo challenges Motoha to a batting contest.
Motoha starts an intense training regimen at the batting cages to prepare for her match with Tamayo. She strives to not stop training until she gets the results she needs to win.
Tamayo has a word with {NAME2} at the batting cages. She tells him that she couldn't understand why Motoha quit baseball so suddenly, and challenged her to the batting contest in hopes of finding out the truth.
With Motoha forcing herself to train non-stop, {NAME2} invites her to the diner to give her a break. After calming down, she rediscovers the purpose of her training, and gains newfound determination.
Despite having no hope of victory, Motoha fights hard but is ultimately defeated in her contest with Tamayo. After witnessing her strong will and attitude at play, Tamayo finally accepts Motoha's decision to quit baseball.
Motoha invites {NAME2} out to Odaiba Seaside Park, a place full of memories for her. Finally able to move on from her contest with Tamayo, Motoha faces the future with greater ambition than ever before.
A third-year high school student at Kokatsu Academy, she is the talented and beautiful chair of the disciplinary committee. Her father owns Umetane, a corporation that operates several food businesses nationwide, and as his potential successor, she is undergoing rigorous training.
Riko invites {NAME2} out to a buffet in Shibuya, where she asks for his assistance in discovering her true self, beyond the values imposed upon her by her upbringing.
Challenging herself to do something she'd never normally do, Riko goes on a taste-testing tour of Chinatown. During her outing, she overhears a surprising conversation about her strict father.
Riko speaks of a past incident related to the conversation she overheard at Chinatown, revealing why she felt her only purpose was to meet the expectations of those around her.
Digging into her childhood for clues, Riko tries to find what it is that she truly wants to do. On the way home from a trip to the aquarium with Motoha, she is surprised to see a certain somebody.
The person she happened to see the other day was her father's former secretary, who used to show her such kindness when she was young. Harboring a mixture of doubt and regret as to why she disappeared so suddenly, Riko decides to investigate what happened all those years ago.
Riko tracks down where the former secretary currently works, and goes to meet her. It's a hospital with ties to Umetane. There, Riko meets the director of the hospital, who she knew when she was younger.
Speaking with the former secretary, Riko is able to confront the burden of needing to meet the expectations of those around her. The director of the hospital advises that Riko speak to her father herself.
Riko confesses her dream of becoming a teacher to her father. To her surprise, rather than firmly oppose her desire, he hands her a memory stick that belonged to her mother.
On the memory stick is a video message left by her mother. Riko struggles to fight back the tears as she watches it, finally understanding her parents' love for her.
Riko realizes that there was never any pressure for her to meet others' expectations. Rather than rush her decision to become a teacher or the successor of Umetane, she chooses to take her time and walk her own path.
A mysterious creature that resembles an owl and can communicate with humans. He has a calm disposition, but his antiquated vocabulary tends to confuse those around him. Nestled comfortably in {NAME2}'s bag, he is a reliable companion that offers helpful advice.
Lufel is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the Metaverse, always giving useful advice to {NAME2}. However, he has lost part of his memory and does not know who he is. For some reason, he seems to have a powerful fixation with the concept of desire.
Lufel has the ability to transform into a car and drive {NAME2} and co. around Mementos. According to him, the concept of "animals turning into vehicles" is a cognition firmly established in Mementos, but the details are unclear.
Lufel, with his strange fixation on desire, witnesses the protagonist undergo a startling transformation...
{NAME2}, with his powers now awakened, stands with Lufel at his side. As a bond of friendship forms between them, what will fate have in store for these unlikely comrades...?
A second-year student at Kokatsu Academy from class 2-D, next to {NAME2}'s classroom. While a compassionate guy, his awkwardness and poor social skills keep him from having many friends his age, so he spends his time alone more often than not.
After his confrontation with Miyazawa, Shun sets his focus on his dream of owning his own ramen shop in the future. He begins his search for his ideal ramen flavor, and asks {NAME2} to help him find it.
In his search for the ideal flavor, Shun picks out a monjayaki shop in Tsukishima. The ramen on their side menu uses the same dashi as the monjayaki, leaving Shun deeply moved by the flavor.
Taking an interest in both the cooking and managing side of business, Shun decides to try soupless tantanmen from a takeout spot. He's impressed by all the consideration they put into ensuring it stays tasty for a long while.
While eating a special curry ramen set at a ramen shop in Ogikubo, Shun is astounded by the uncompromising effort that went into the harmony of the dish, and recalls some memories from his childhood.
Shun heads to a diner that's running a collab menu with a famous ramen shop. There, he meets prestigious food consultant Takumi Serizawa, who invites him to enter her upcoming contest to create a new ramen dish.
Shun has come up with the novel concept of a ramenburger to present at the contest. He asks {NAME2} to taste-test it, and uses his feedback to further refine it.
Shun presents his carefully perfected ramenburger to Serizawa, but unfortunately it wasn't what she was looking for. Rather than come up with an outlandish idea, she advises him to give an entry that shows what he's learned.
Having hit a brick wall trying to come up with a dish for the contest, Shun heads to Heritage Kitchen to take a break. There, he learns that Pops adjusts his fried rice based on the customer's mood, giving him a new idea for his dish...
Inspired by Heritage Kitchen's fried rice, Shun comes up with a ramen that can be customized to suit the customer, and earns Serizawa's approval to enter it in the contest.
As thanks for helping him prepare for the contest, Shun treats {NAME2} to a bowl of ramen that he made with him in mind. This is just the beginning of Shun's search for his ideal flavor...
A first-year student at Kokatsu Academy. Deeply immersed in a world of fantasy, he is the self-proclaimed "Chosen One". He claims to possess otherworldly powers, but this has left him with few friends and a life of solitude.
While paying a visit to the library, {NAME2} is approached by Kurotani, who deems him to be a fellow chosen one like himself. He explains that they are destined to protect the school from a sinister threat.
Kurotani tells {NAME2} of the Harrowed Grounds, one of the many threats that surround the school. When they go to investigate, they discover a patch of land where plants refuse to grow... only to find out it's where the local cats have been answering nature's call.
{NAME2} and Kurotani head to the Hall of Lament to investigate the source of a terrifying wail... which turns out to be a drama club student practicing her acting.
Kurotani and {NAME2} head to the school store to uncover the mystery behind the Assassin's Juice, rumored to make any student who drinks it disappear. There, they spy a student buying up the entire supply of juice, and decide to investigate his motives.
As they follow Kazuki Take, the boy who bought up all the juice, Kurotani and {NAME2} discover that he's being taken advantage of by bullies. Kurotani steps in to defend him, sending the three bullies running.
Finding a letter from a female student in his shoe locker, Kurotani asks {NAME2} to accompany him to the audiovisual room to meet her, only to be trapped inside. To his surprise, it was a prank, and the culprit was none other than Take. Why would he do such a thing?
It turns out that Take was forced by his mean friends from the other day to prank Kurotani. Kurotani tries to convince Take to cut ties with them, but he refuses to listen.
Kurotani still feels conflicted about Take standing up for his so-called friends. He opens up to {NAME2} about his own lonely past, and finds renewed ambition to save Take from those bullies.
Kurotani asks Take to lead him to his so-called friends, so he can settle this once and for all. The tense confrontation culminates with Take defending Kurotani, and bravely standing up to the bullies himself.
Thanks to Kurotani, Take's relationship with his three friends has improved tremendously. Through this experience, Kurotani was able to learn what it means to be a friend, and reaffirm his friendship with {NAME2}.
A first-year university student from Sichuan, China currently staying in an apartment in Yongen-Jaya. She's an optimistic girl who'll approach anyone with a smile, though she does have a bit of a childish side.
While at the supermarket in Yongen-Jaya, {NAME2} bumps into Yaoling Li, a cheerful exchange student from Sichuan, China. As she's still not used to life in Japan, she's quick to request his help.
It was Yaoling's parents that encouraged her to study abroad, but she's still unsure as to what she should be getting out of it. So in order to understand the purpose of her exchange, she hopes to experience as much as she can while she's here.
Yaoling heads to Jinbocho to browse the countless secondhand bookstores that line its streets. Surprised to see so few students there, she wonders if Japanese students also feel a lack of purpose in their studies.
Yaoling pays a visit to the fashion hotspot of Harajuku. Admiring how the young people express themselves through fashion, she begins to contemplate what her core values are.
Near Yongen-Jaya Station, Yaoling happens to see her neighbor, Yukimi Fujikawa, being yelled at by her mother. Yaoling feels troubled, and she wonders what she can do to help her.
Hoping to find out more about her family situation, Yaoling and {NAME2} invite Yukimi on a trip to Asakusa. Yukimi insists that "Mother knows best," which only makes Yaoling all the more concerned.
As thanks for inviting her out to Asakusa, Yukimi takes Yaoling to a traditional Japanese teahouse. Yaoling is fascinated to learn about tea ceremonies, but as cultures clash, she accidentally ends up causing trouble for the staff... and Yukimi.
Yaoling wants to make things up to Yukimi somehow. Realizing that she was only causing her more trouble, Yaoling hopes to better explain herself, and invites Yukimi out to another tea party, this time from her own culture.
Yaoling introduces Yukimi to a different tea-drinking experience, with a unique combination of teas and snacks. Through it, she conveys the importance of finding what's right for you as opposed to strictly adhering to tradition.
Through her clash and reconciliation with Yukimi, Yaoling came to understand the differences in culture between China and Japan, and the importance of bridging that gap. She hopes that {NAME2} will continue to help her as her sensei, so she can learn even more.
A second-year student at Kokatsu Academy, belonging to class 2-D. She's been friends with Motoha since elementary school, and was battery mates with her in little league, where they won countless games together.
After her dream of becoming a pro baseball player is shattered by Kiuchi, Tomoko decides to look for a part-time job that she can devote herself to. She asks {NAME2} to accompany her to her first job at a cr\xeape shop.
The next job that Tomoko decides to take on is at the beef bowl restaurant in Shibuya. With her sharp eyes honed from years of playing baseball, she catches a customer who's been causing trouble for the store red-handed.
Tomoko and the protagonist take up a part-time job at the convenience store in Shibuya. She's left feeling somewhat glum when her neighbor comes to the counter and brings up her injury, but otherwise manages to complete her shift without trouble.
While working at the drugstore in Shibuya, Tomoko and {NAME2} meet the famous figure skater, Kotone Montagne, who also suffered an injury.
{NAME2} and Tomoko take up a part-time job at an accessory store in Shinjuku. She reflects on the struggles she's faced since her injury, and worries that Kotone might be going through the same.
Tomoko and {NAME2} happen to be working at the flower shop when Kotone comes in with a difficult request. Tomoko goes above and beyond to amass all the flowers needed for Kotone's bouquet, leading to the two becoming even closer.
For their next part time job, Tomoko and {NAME2} work at the diner in Shibuya. Just as they're about to leave, they bump into Kotone, so they end up sharing a meal together, and make plans to meet up again.
The three head out to Odaiba Seaside Park, where they spend a fun-filled day together. As they're about to head home, Kotone opens up about the true reason why she hasn't returned to figure skating... Her confidence has been destroyed by hurtful comments online.
While working at the book store in Shibuya, Tomoko thinks back to her baseball days, and tries to come up with a way to help Kotone remember the fans who have supported her.
Tomoko invites Kotone to visit their school and, with the help of the brass band, surprises her with a cheer song just for her. Kotone is deeply moved, and in that moment, Tomoko feels that her days playing baseball were truly worthwhile.
A lively housewife who lives next door to {NAME2}. She was once a stylist, but retired after getting married, and feels a slight tinge of emptiness in her heart. She's known to let slip some occasional outdated slang from her youth.
Tomiyama is going to be looking after her nephew who happens to be around {NAME2}'s age. In order to better get along with him, she wants to get some insight on how kids these days think.
Tomiyama wants her nephew to send her a photo so that she can recognize him when she picks him up at the station, but is shocked to find that when she asks him for an MMS, he has no idea what she's talking about.
Tomiyama is astonished to learn that her nephew, Leo Kamiyama, never walks around with any cash on him. Thinking back to how things were when she was younger, she becomes even more painfully aware of the generation gap than before.
Tomiyama can't help but wonder if the fact that her and Leo haven't had any arguments might be a sign of distance between them. She figures she's probably needlessly worrying, but still can't keep it out of her mind.
Tomiyama wants to do something to support Leo in preparation for his audition. Seeing him pursue his dream reminds her of how she fought with her parents back when she was doing the same.
Unfortunately, Leo's audition didn't go so well, and Tomiyama's unsure of how to console him. At {NAME2}'s suggestion, she decides not to make a big fuss about it, but is she just overthinking things?
Tomiyama is still worrying over how to support Leo, and turns to {NAME2} for advice. Even she realizes that she might be interfering too much...
Tomiyama makes a careless remark that causes Leo to run away from home. She asks {NAME2} to help bring him home, and the two of them realize where they both went wrong.
After talking things through with Tomiyama, Leo has decided to move out. Through his interactions with Tomiyama and {NAME2}, he was finally able to understand what he needs to do as an actor.
Tomiyama came to understand the differences between the youths of today and her, both now at her current age and when she was young herself. She hopes that next time, she'll be able to better support people in different circumstances than her.
A mysterious avatar that {NAME2} meets in Harvest World Online. Cheerful and friendly, her somewhat refined manner of speech and eccentric behavior is rather endearing.
When {NAME2} signs in to the virtual world, he's greeted by a rather assertive player going by the name of Yui, and winds up agreeing to start a farm with her.
{NAME2} logs in to the virtual world to find that Yui has plowed the land with a giant tractor. They head to town to buy seeds and fertilizer, where another player warns {NAME2} about spending time with her.
While watering the field with a large hose, Yui opens up about her lonely experience playing the game. {NAME2} decides not to worry about it and offers to keep playing with her.
While using a bazooka to spray the field with fertilizer, Yui chats with {NAME2} about potatoes. Their conversation leads to her asking him if he'd go with her "friend" to a burger shop in Shibuya.
{NAME2} heads to the burger shop in Shibuya and meets Yui's friend, Musubi Matsukata. She seems very busy with her IT job, and talks wistfully about growing up on a farm.
{NAME2} logs in to find Yui performing a rousing cheerleading routine to the potatoes, but when they discover that their field has been attacked by potato moles, Yui is devastated and abruptly logs off.
When Yui finally returns to the game some time later, she's surprised to find that the field is thriving once again\u2014all thanks to the hard work of {NAME2}, who dealt with the moles while she was away. Now Yui's back to her enthusiastic self.
A reinvigorated Yui flies a helicopter over the field, scattering seeds to diversify their crops. As they discuss real-world plants, Yui mentions that Musubi has also expressed interest in growing plants, and asks if {NAME2} would give her some advice.
{NAME2} and Musubi head out to the flower shop in Shibuya to pick out a plant that would suit her busy lifestyle. She also explains why Yui was offline for such a long time.
{NAME2} logs in to find Yui blowing up nearby mountains. She wants to clear some land and make the place resemble Musubi's hometown. {NAME2} promises to keep supporting her.
A college student and musician. She stands at a corner of Shibuya Station Square with guitar in hand, challenging herself to put on a successful street performance. Though she may be shy and introverted, she's an incredibly talented guitar player...
Maybe it's because I joined the school's band club, but I can't help but notice the girl standing with a guitar at Shibuya Station Square. She's not playing anything, and seems to be looking for something. I glance at the small piece of paper I just picked up. It's a street performance permit, and it says her name is Ayaka Sakai. Through this chance encounter, the two of us become acquainted. It seems as though she's struggling to muster up the courage to perform in public...
When I meet Sakai again, she's finally found the courage to perform in public. She pulls it off smoothly, and her tone is clear... but it seems that she couldn't catch anyone's attention. This leaves Sakai terribly shocked.
A disheartened Sakai opens up about her past. Back in high school, she was invited by her friend to join their band. Being shy, she never imagined herself performing, but the opportunity opened her up to the world of music. Even after their band broke up, she didn't want to give up on music...
Sakai's singing voice is very pleasant, with a pure tone that moves those who listen to it. She plays a song she made with her band in high school, which remains a cherished memory for her. I think about what I can do to help her find the courage to sing in public... and come up with a few ideas.
Thinking that rhythm could be the key to help Sakai sing, I decide to meet her in Shibuya with my secret weapon: a tambourine. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city, Sakai finally begins to sing, and many people stop to listen.
After her last performance was a success, Sakai's confidence has greatly increased. She tells me that she plans to write her own original song, one filled with feelings she wants to express...
Sakai seems to be down. Wondering if something happened, I ask her what's wrong, and with a sad look in her eyes, she proceeds to explain. She says the friend from high school who invited her to join the band told her, "You were definitely meant to be a musician, Ayaka. More than I ever was." Hearing that her friend has completely given up on the path of music has left Sakai feeling confused...
While discussing the song that Sakai is working on, she comes to realize why she was so drawn to the world of music in the first place: it allows her to boldly express emotions that she can't normally put into words herself. This is the reason why she's writing her song.
At the usual place, I finally hear Sakai's original song. Amidst the sometimes sad, sometimes tense melody, her kind and passionate emotions shine through. This song, which she wrote for the people who supported her, is sure to touch the hearts of many.
Sakai chooses to debut her new song in Shibuya, the place that marks her starting point and was where we first met. I accompany her with my specialty, the bass. This is a performance for her and me, and will be a lasting memory for the both of us.
A woman who works at an underground bar in Shibuya. Her specialty is flair bartending. Although she might appear mature at first glance, looks can be deceiving...
I met Shiina by total coincidence... If she hadn't splashed me with water, I never would have set foot in her bar or found out that minors could even go in. Her bartending skills are impressive, and she tells me that she's looking for a mocktail taste-tester, so I take her up on her offer.
For our first taste-testing session, Shiina shows off her excellent bartending skills. As we chat, she tells me how she came to be a bartender. She had come to the bar to drink her sorrows away, but she was so amazed by the owner's bartending skills that she wanted to share that amazement with other people. She felt embarrassed talking about it, but it truly is a wonderful dream.
During one of her shifts, Shiina performs a flair bartending routine that incorporates dance movements for a customer. That's when I learn that Shiina previously studied dance and participated in numerous competitions... though she avoids mentioning why it is that she quit.
As I get to know Shiina better, she teaches me more of her bartending techniques. She even encourages me to try putting my own spin on recipes if I have any ideas.
One of the customer's remarks reminded Shiina about her past. Seeing her a bit down, I try mixing her a special drink, just like she taught me. Comforted by the drink, she opens up about what's on her mind\u2014she wishes she could have become a dancer. Shiina says she just wanted to be able to enjoy doing what she liked, but in reality, it's not that easy...
The bar owner left an application for a flair bartending contest for Shiina, but she feels conflicted about whether or not to sign up. Shiina takes this opportunity to finally open up about her past. She ultimately gave up dancing because somebody kept coming to her dancing competitions to criticize her every mistake, until she couldn't take it any longer. This is why she fears competing to this day. After telling her story, she feels a little better, but her desire still lingers...
While talking with Shiina about her latest mocktail, the man who harassed her in the past shows up at the bar and starts criticizing her bartending. I help chase him off, but if we don't do something about him, Shiina's desires will be stolen again. I won't let that happen a second time.
After successfully changing his heart, the man apologizes for his actions. Shiina seems to realize that I had something to do with it, but decides not to press me on it. With her desire restored, Shiina regains the courage to face the world once more. Perhaps she'll even be able to enjoy doing what she loves again.
Having decided to participate in the flair bartending contest, Shiina starts practicing her drink-mixing. The contest involves making an original cocktail, but she gets a bit carried away and winds up getting herself drunk... But hey, at least she's happy again.
The competition is over. Unfortunately, Shiina didn't win... but she's not upset about it in the slightest. She excitedly tells me about everything she gained from the experience. Shiina makes me a non-alcoholic version of the cocktail she presented at the contest, and it was apparently inspired by me... It won't be for another few years, but I can't wait to try the real thing once I'm an adult.

In a high-class casino you've never seen before, a figure who appeared to be a thief was cornered by men in black suits.
The men suddenly transformed into monsters, but the thief was unshaken, and easily dispatched them.
However, before he could make his exit, a masked figure appeared and attacked him...
You suddenly felt tired in the classroom and fell asleep. You awakened to find yourself in a mysterious space that seemed to be an undersea tunnel.
You met a strange, long-nosed old man who called himself Igor, along with his assistant, Merope...
Before you knew it, you awakened back in the classroom... but was it really just a dream?
As you started to head home, a group of girls chatting in the hallway blocked your path.
However, when you tried to call out to them, you felt strange and couldn't muster up the energy to do anything.
Just then, the head of the Disciplinary Committee happened to pass by and helped you out.
You witnessed a shocking scene from the train platform, but something wasn't right about the reactions from those around you.
Still feeling strange, you boarded the train, when suddenly a talking owl called out to you.
You struggled to process all of the unusual events of the past day, but this was really just the beginning...
The strange creature calling itself "Lufel" was your guide as you entered a mysterious other world called Mementos.
As you tried to find a way out, terrifying monsters surrounded you, and all hope seemed lost.
However, before your strength failed completely, you awakened to a power that was slumbering within you: your Persona.
Your classmate Motoha Arai told you the latest rumors about Divine Justice, a website that collects information on Menaces.
Afterwards, Lufel told you about the evil deeds committed by a Menace named Takeyuki Kiuchi.
In order to infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace, you will need to craft some infiltration tools.
You headed to Yongen-Jaya with Lufel to secure a workbench to use.
Meanwhile, Motoha was overjoyed to hear that her best friend Tomoko was scouted for the baseball team.
Once again, you were summoned to the Velvet Room, where you were told about the importance of shared bonds of desire.
According to Merope, it seems several people have already been effected by the ripples of your desire.
Igor warned you that you must nurture your desires to avoid a fate of ruin.
Kiuchi had set his sights on Motoha as his next target, and attempted to attack her on her way to school.
However, sensing the danger just in time, Tomoko shielded Motoha and ended up grievously injured instead.
Motoha pleaded with the police to do something about Kiuchi, but with their desires stolen from them, they had no motivation to help.
After overhearing your conversation with Motoha on the school rooftop, Lufel could see the potential for strong desire within her.
As evidence, the Metaverse Navigator app icon appeared on her smartphone.
However, Lufel didn't think she was truly committed to the job, and thought it would be best not to get her involved.
The route to the Treasure was secured, but in order to execute the change of heart, every member of the Phantom Thieves must be in agreement.
After seeing how Tomoko's desires and will to live had been stolen from her, Motoha felt renewed motivation to change Kiuchi's heart.
You and Lufel agreed, and decided to deliver the calling card to Kiuchi.
Lufel flew above Shibuya and scattered a huge flurry of Kiuchi's calling cards over the plaza.
When Kiuchi saw the calling card, he stormed away from the station in a rage.
The time for a decisive battle has arrived. You and your fellow Phantom Thieves made the final preparations and headed for Kiuchi's Palace.
Kiuchi's heart was successfully changed, and you went out for ramen with your teammates to celebrate.
On the train to Shinjuku, Motoha asked Lufel about regaining his lost memories.\nAccording to Lufel, each Treasure may return part of his memories, and there are seven of them in total.
In the middle of your dinner at Victory Kitchen, you got kicked out by a man named Miyazawa.
While discussing the flavor of the ramen outside the restaurant, you were approached by Shun Kano, a student who goes to your school.
Later, you saw a news report on Kiuchi's arrest, and decided to continue your work as a Phantom Thief.
The famous food critic Hiromu Miyazawa filmed a video at Victory Kitchen while no customers were around.
Once the video was over, his demeanor changed completely, and he demanded an unbelievable sum of money from the manager, Masa.
He threatened to spread bad press about the restaurant if he refused, leaving Masa no choice but to comply.
Ever since Kiuchi's arrest, the talk about the calling card and the Phantom Thieves has increased.
Motoha was glad to hear that you wanted to continue your Phantom Thief activities, and hopes to continue working together.
At the same time, Miyazawa was scheming to take control over Victory Kitchen's business.
During a volleyball match in gym class, Motoha was doing well and was congratulated by the other students.
Shun talked to you while you were stretching and asked you about her.
Later, you and Lufel paid a visit to a clinic in Yongen-Jaya.
You were unable to find the next Palace in Mementos, and returned to the real world, where you happened to meet Shun.
After hearing that Motoha missed the old flavors of Victory Kitchen she remembered from long ago, Shun invites you both to visit Heritage Kitchen that night.
While eating at Victory Kitchen, Masa told you about the feud between Miyazawa and Shun.
On the way to school, you happened to meet Tomoko. She was discharged from the hospital and seemed to be doing much better.
According to Lufel, it seems highly likely that the next Palace ruler will be connected to Heritage Kitchen somehow.
To look for clues, you made your way to Heritage Kitchen after school.
Heritage Kitchen was closed, and inside, Miyazawa forced the owner, Yamagoshi, to hand over the ownership documents.
Against Yamagoshi's will, Miyazawa stamped the papers. Just then, Shun appeared and clashed with Miyazawa again.
Miyazawa suggested settling the matter in a "Food Fight", and Shun accepted the challenge.
Miyazawa proposed the Food Fight under the orders of some mysterious person.
In exchange, this unknown benefactor said they would help make Miyazawa's dreams come true.
Meanwhile, you found the location of Miyazawa's Palace within Mementos, and attempted to begin your infiltration.
In the Velvet Room, Igor offered his congratulations for your victory over the sinner of lust.
Continuing on, he suggested that even more people may be affected by your desires and the choices you make.
Later, you talked with Shun on the rooftop and learned his past, as well as his true reason for accepting Miyazawa's challenge.
In the video Motoha showed you, you find out that Shun did end up going to Victory Kitchen to settle his score with Miyazawa.
Feeling like Shun's chances of winning were slim, you called Yamagoshi at the hospital and asked for help.
He was able to give you a valuable hint, and you hurried off with your companions to help Shun.
Miyazawa tried to strongarm Masa into helping with the rigged Food Fight, but Masa refused.
Ultimately, Masa was forced to leave the judging panel, and Shun's Food Fight against Miyazawa began.
At that time, you found yourself stuck on a stopped train, and you had no choice but to use a risky move...
Shun realized he didn't have the shaver box he needed to prepare the ramen. Miyazawa just laughed, and told him he threw it away.
However, you were able to deliver Yamagoshi's message to Masa. He found the shaver box in the safe, and gave it to Shun.
Thanks to your efforts, Shun was able to flawlessly recreate the legendary flavor of Victory Kitchen.
The genuine flavor that Shun served up was enough to move Miyazawa to tears. It seemed like Shun's victory was certain.
However, Miyazawa refused to accept defeat, and even attempted to call the police on Shun.
You fled the shop along with Shun, but at that moment, Shun activated the Metaverse Navigator.
In the aftermath of the Food Fight, Miyazawa wasn't doing very well, and seemed to be feeling the pressure from his mysterious contact.
Hiding his internal dissatisfaction, he headed to Victory Kitchen to record another video.
But when he arrived, he count the store plastered with calling cards from the Phantom Thieves.
Defeated, Miyazawa's Shadow confessed his dreams of becoming an actor and his long-held desire to be the "real thing".
As he was on the verge of giving up, Shun lectured him, telling him to atone for his sins and then come back to the shop one more time.
But as you headed back to reality with your friends, you experienced a sudden vision of all of them disappearing...
Fresh from your successful operation at Miyazawa's Palace, Lufel speculated that there may be a hidden mastermind behind Miyazawa's distorted desires.
Miyazawa's Shadow mentioned someone just before fading away. Could they be the true culprit?
Upon your return to reality, you found that Miyazawa's Treasure had changed form and become an old movie ticket.
The public was shocked by Miyazawa's sudden declaration that he would quit his career as a celebrity critic.
He also made a public confession to all the crimes he committed, breaking down into tears as he apologized.
After this second successful change of heart, the bonds between the Phantom Thieves have grown even stronger.
Ms. Katayama objected to the introduction of the new educational consultant, Kei Akashi.
However, the academic coordinator Mr. Yamanashi supported Akashi and criticized the way Ms. Katayama handles her students.
After that, Ms. Katayama seemed to be irritible during class, and some of the students looked unhappy.
You headed to a new area of Mementos, where you were attacked by an enemy you defeated once before.
With the help of your allies, you were able to defeat them, but unfortunately you couldn't locate the next Palace.
Meanwhile, the Menace known only as the "Hit-and-Run Rider" is causing chaos in the city at night.
Once again, Igor congratulated you for defeating the sinner of vanity.
However, he also suggested there may be others besides the Phantom Thieves capable of using the Metaverse Navigator.
The next day, you encountered Yamagoshi on your way to school. Now that Miyazawa's heart has been changed, Yamagoshi seems to be in better health.
On a rainy day, you and Motoha forgot to bring umbrellas, so Riko Tanemura offered both of you a ride in her car to school.
Riko seemed to be constantly busy during the ride, but you also got the feeling that she has a good relationship with Motoha.
You said your goodbyes to Riko when you arrived at school, and then Motoha remembered there was a school-wide assembly in the gym.
Akashi gave his self-introduction at the morning assembly, and explained what his role would be. The students seemed to have a positive response.
Later, Mr. Yamanashi asked Riko to help out Akashi, which they both agreed to.
The next day, Ms. Katayama attempted to stop a student acting dangerously in the hall, which caused a stir.
The video of Ms. Katayama stopping the student in the hallway was posted to Divine Justice, and she was publicly branded as an abusive teacher.
Without giving her a chance to defend herself, Mr. Yamanashi condemned her and ordered her to be suspended.
With no other teachers coming to her side, Ms. Katayama had no choice but to accept the punishment.
Somewhere in Mementos, a massive Shadow let out a bellowing roar...
In the real world, Akashi managed to acquire evidence that Ms. Katayama was the infamous "Hit-and-Run Rider", and silently smiled to himself.
After Ms. Katayama's suspension, the teachers have been unable to control the students.
As you were infiltrating Katayama's Palace, you found your path blocked by a strangely dressed man.
Back in reality, you theorized that the man was probably a cognitive form of Akashi created by Katayama.
That night, following Shun's suggestion, the Phantom Thieves met up at Heritage Kitchen.
While eating at Heritage Kitchen, you heard about Ms. Katayama's school days from Yamagoshi and Masa.
Ms. Katayama seemed worried about how busy Riko always is, but when Akashi showed up, she suddenly became enraged.
Unable to hold back her anger, Ms. Katayama started to get violent, but the scene was caught on film by a student.
Ms. Katayama was suspended from school due to accusations of violent behavior.
You met with your teammates on the rooftop, and after considering what happened at Katayama's Palace, decided to investigate Akashi.
However, just as you were about to begin the operation, an unexpected person offered to help.
Riko's plan went perfectly, and you were able to get the password from Akashi's PC with no problems.
After that, you met up with Riko at a caf\xe9 in Kichijoji, and asked her about the information she got from the PC.
It seemed she was not able to check everything yet, but you still got plenty of info besides just the password.

I'm really not\nfeeling it right\nnow...
This guy... I should\nreport him online as\na Menace.
I wonder if someone\ncould cover my\nshift...
Wonder if there's\nanything new on\nDivine Justice.
That ramen shop in\nShinjuku is getting\na lot of buzz.
What are they\ndoing here?
They don't seem to\nknow anything.
This sucks, man...
What should I do...
Sticking around here\nisn't so bad,\nreally...
What was my name,\nagain?
I can't remember\nanything... I'm just\ntrapped here...
I hope these days\nwill never end.
This sucks. I just\nwanna go home and\nhit the sack.
Ooh, something's\ngoing down on\nDivine Justice.
The caf\xe9 over\nthere is really\ngood...
The doctor at that\nclinic is real\nstrange...
What should I do\nfor dinner?
I really want to\npull a rare figure.
Old movies aren't\nbad. What's showing\nnext month?
Whoa! Someone broke\nthe record at the\nbatting cages?
Think I'll visit\nthe bookstore.
Wonder if there's\nanything good on\nTV tonight.
Booored.
Ugh! Why does\neverything have to\nbe so annoying?
That must've been\nreally tough!
Did you hear that?
Shhh, someone will\nhear you!
Really? Seriously?
I know!
So tired...
There's too many...
Did you read it?\nThe article.
Kiuchi's pitch got\nhit by some kid.\nNo way, right?
He told that\nreporter it was\na real pitch...
Huh? So that was the\nbest he could do?
If it's true, that's\npretty abysmal.
Yeah. But you know\nwhat he said after?
"I didn't really try\nbecause no women\nwere watching"!
Hahaha! Seriously?\nStill, losing to a\nkid? Pathetic!
He always talks so\nbig, but he might\nreally be weak.
He may stand out on\nour team, but he's\nnot all that.
If he does make it\nto majors, he won't\nlast long.
We should stop\ntalking. If someone\noverhears us...
Those guys...\nAre they joking!?
Talking shit behind\nmy back!?
How dare they laugh\nat me... Screw those\nbastards!
Sato-senpai is\ndefinitely our\nMVP, but...
Doesn't he have\nany weaknesses?
Oh right...
Apparently, he once\nheard a loud bang\nand fainted.
Hiih...\nHaah...
I wonder how\nKiuchi-sama's\ndoing...
Kiuchi-sama...\nWhere is he, anyway?
He's the only one\nnot here yet.
I don't feel like\ndoing much lately...
I don't want to do\nanything. It's all\nso boring...
Why do I have to\nfill in this\ndumb form?
I haven't thought\nabout the future\nat all...
I wouldn't mind\nstaying home and\ndoing nothing.
Go into the family\nbusiness, or set off\non my own. Hm...
A lot of students\nare skipping school\nthese days.
I can't focus\nat all.
Why do I have to\nstudy so much?
Class is\ntoo hard.
Seems like everyone\ngoes on Divine\nJustice lately.
What is there to\neven gain from being\na Menace?
I wonder if I\ncan still get\nyakisoba bread.
That was Noge-san\njust now, right?\nCute as always...
There's a scary guy\non the rooftop...
I'm sleepy. Maybe a\nnap will make me\nfeel better.
Afternoon classes\nare such a drag.
I wanna go lie\ndown somewhere...
This weather's\nperfect for a\nlunchtime walk.
Arai-san and\nNoge-san make quite\na pair, huh?
Someone was shoved\nviolently at\nthe station!
I wonder if Noge-san\nis okay...
Who would do\nsuch a thing?\nThat's terrible.
No updates from\nDivine Justice yet.
An accident? I hope\neveryone's okay...
Things feel really\ndangerous lately.
Damn... I had a\nshift today,\ndidn't I?
Maybe I should buy\nsome new clothes.
Ah... I'm tired...
The airsoft shop guy\ndoesn't look like\na civilian...
Looks like a new\nmovie is coming out.
The Subway Slammer\nwas once a pro\nbaseball player?
Takeyuki Kiuchi?\nWho's that?
Were there really\nthis many victims?
That bastard Kiuchi.\nI hope he rots in\njail for life.
Food reviews these\ndays are pretty\nentertaining.
I hear\nVictory Kitchen\nis pretty good.
Ah... I'm craving\nChinese food...
All he did was shove\npeople. How is that\nnewsworthy?
No news from\nDivine Justice...
I saw Noge-san earlier.\nI hope she's doing\nokay now.
When will Heritage\nKitchen reopen?
Do food critics\nreally have that\nmuch influence?
Arai-san's been\nhanging out with\nboys a lot...
The internet's\nso boring lately.
I wanna go home\nand play games.
I heard\nthat food critic\napologized.
Do you think those\nshops that closed\ncan reopen?
There haven't been\nany good anime\nlately...
Heritage Kitchen was\nreally delicious.
I'm tired. I feel\nsleep-deprived\nevery day.
Hey! What are you\nlooking at?
We can't trust\neverything food\ninfluencers say.
Let's go back to\nthat old shop!
Huh? You have\nthat figure!?
What the heck is\nan "educational\nadvisor"?
The new teacher\nseems pretty good.
I don't really like\nthat new teacher...
Where should we go\nafter school today?
I saw a great new\nanime. You should\ncheck it out!
The new teacher? Oh,\nI was distracted by\nRiko-senpai...
Wanna head home\ntogether?
Hey, wait up!
Do you think the\nclass rep is, uh,\nsingle?
The new teacher is\nso hot... Should I\ntalk to him?
Not bad...
It's too crowded.\nI can't shop\nlike this.
This store is\nso last season.
Whoa! Who can afford\nto spend this much\non clothes?
That movie was\npretty good.
Wanna go to karaoke?
I'm hungry.\nLet's go eat.
My muscles are\nkilling me. I've\nbeen slacking.
Is this line just\nfor the fitting\nroom?
The airsoft shop\nover there is\nreal cool.
A lot of people got\nhurt by the Subway\nSlammer, huh?
He's not here,\nis he?
Ouch... It still hurts\nwhere he hit me...
I heard he hangs\naround the station.
That's seriously\ntraumatizing.
Why hasn't he\nbeen arrested?
Uh... This tastes\nstrange. I don't\nlike it.
Isn't there a nicer\nrestaurant nearby?
I wonder which books\nare popular lately.
That guy's\npretty cute.
Can you believe what\nthey sell in vending\nmachines now?
Let's go eat cr\xeapes.
The gym trainer\nseems a bit strange.
I want to stop at\nthe drugstore on the\nway home.
I heard a student\ngot injured\nrecently...
Someone got pushed\non the tracks! Hope\nthey're okay...
When are they going\nto catch him?
I hope that girl\nis all right...
I'm too scared\nto go out into\nthe city now...
He only attacks\nwomen. It's\nterrifying...
I don't even have an\nappetite anymore...
The underground\nmall's got new\nclothes in stock!
Where should I get\na part-time job?
Oh no! I'm going\nto be late for\nmy shift!
I'm exhausted.\nThink I'll go to the\nbathhouse.
There's always\nstudents studying\nat the diner.
The manager of\nthe airsoft shop\nis scary...
How long should\nwe practice today?
Didn't they see him\non the security\ncameras?
The police should\ndo something soon.
I wonder if\nMagatsukami knows\nwho he is.
I've been so busy\nlately, I haven't\nhad a break...
I want to\ngo on a trip.
Why aren't you\nanswering the phone?
My entire body is\ncovered in grilled\nmeat stink.
I can't relax...
They finally caught\nthat guy.
Why would a baseball\nplayer do something\nlike that...?
Yes! They finally\ngot him!
Now I don't have to\nbe so scared to go\nout anymore.
Huh? He turned\nhimself in?
He came forward?\nHe didn't get\ncaught?
I wonder how long\nhis sentence is\ngonna be.
There's a good ramen\nshop in Shinjuku.
Ooh, a fortune\nteller in Shinjuku\nyou say?
The ramen at\nVictory Kitchen\nis really good.
That gourmet food\ncritic is popular\nthese days.
No new stores are\nopening lately...
That bastard should\nhave been caught a\nlong time ago.
It's nice to be able\nto go about the city\nwithout fear.
I hope he spends the\nrest of his life\nbehind bars.
This place is\ndelicious! Why's the\nrating so bad?
Wait, is that\ncritic just making\nstuff up?
Take online reviews\nwith a massive pinch\nof salt.
Let's go eat at\nthat new shop.
These reviews are\nglowing... Were they\npaid off?
Wow, it looks really\ndelicious in\nthe photo.
I heard that shop is\ncollaborating with a\ngourmet critic.
These two review\nscores are totally\ndifferent...
Let's go get\nsomething to drink.
Who would want to go\nup against a gourmet\nfood critic?
Haha, that pose!\nIs he trying to look\nlike a samurai?
A Food Fight, huh?\nSounds interesting.
Has it really been\nthat long since the\nincident...?
This place has\ngotten a lot of bad\nreviews lately.
This is delicious!\nI've gotta bookmark\nthis place...
So it was Miyazawa's\nfault that store\nshut down!?
Even if you said\nsorry, we don't have\nto forgive you!
Miyazawa's a Menace?\nBut his show was\nso good...
Does anyone actually\nbelieve what food\ncritics say?
Avoid anywhere\nMiyazawa recommends\nlike the plague.
Don't listen to what\nothers say. As long\nas you like it...
I can't believe\npeople like Miyazawa\nactually exist.
A new restaurant's\nopening soon. I\nwanna try it.
The food I cook\nmyself is the\nmost delicious.
I want Chinese\nfood today.
I heard there was\nan owl here during\nthe day!
Finally finished\nwork...
I feel exhausted\nevery day...
Should we grab a\ndrink somewhere?
I'm working every\nday and have no\ntime for myself.
Guess I'm spending\nthe night at an\ninternet caf\xe9.
That girl's amazing\nat guitar.
Why doesn't that\ngirl with the guitar\nsell CDs?
Let's ask Shichi-kun\nif he knows any new\nshops nearby!
Almost home! Snacks\nand a cold beer are\nwaiting for me!
I don't want\nto go home...
I'm so sick of the\nsame old routine...
We reached our sales\nquota for the month!\nLet's celebrate!
I heard there's\na kid with a pet owl\naround here.
It seems unsafe\naround here lately.
I hope I\nget scouted...
Someone got shoved\nhere in broad\ndaylight.
Would anyone really\nslam into people\non purpose?
I heard the Subway\nSlammer's just some\noffice worker.
Why would someone\nslam into people?\nIt's so scary.
Every shop feels\nshort-staffed now.
I see a young girl\nwith a donation box\nhere sometimes.
Shichi-kun's working\nlate every day...
Why isn't the mascot\na cat?
Let's hurry home.\nIt's been dangerous\nhere lately.
This is the time we\nagreed on. Where\nare they?
It's our first time\nmeeting. Hmm, what\nare they like?
That Subway Slammer\nactually injured\nsomeone?
Aren't there any\npolice officers at\nthe station?
I dropped\nmy wallet...
I heard the train\nstopped. What\nhappened...?
The world is getting\nmore dangerous\nevery day.
That girl who was\npushed on the tracks\nis in hospital.
I wonder if they'll\ncatch the Subway\nSlammer soon.
I think I'll have my\nboyfriend come\npick me up.
I'm too scared\nto walk alone.
I heard he only\ntargets women.\nHow disgusting.
It's not even in the\nnews, and there's no\ninfo online...
If I meet him, I'll\nmake sure he\nregrets it.
Let's go to the\nunderground mall\nat the station.
The underground mall\nmight have a good\ngift for her...
Let's go buy\nsome flowers.
I want a new pair\nof sneakers...
Let's just eat\nsomething.
I heard the\nconvenience store\nis hiring.
I got it!\nLet's get\nsushi today!
I want dumplings...
I should clean, but\nI get tired just\nthinking of it.
The new release is\nout! I'm staying\nup all night!
Has that girl gotten\neven better?
Why hasn't she\nbeen scouted?
Does anyone even use\nphone booths\nthese days?
When will I ever\nwin first prize?
I want to pet the\npigeons, but they\nalways fly away.
There's a really\ncute chubby cat\nin Zoshigaya.
I wish I\nhad a cat...
I haven't seen that\nhalf-Japanese\ngirl today.
Man, school was fun.\nAside from tests and\nbeing broke...
Come on, I gotta win\nsomeday... This is\nso frustrating!
I heard he was\ncaught right here.
I saw when he was\ncaught. He was just\na normal guy.
Didn't the people\nwho got shoved\nreport it?
Let's just go to a\nplace with\nsolid reviews
I can finally\nrest at ease.
I guess the police\ncan do their job\nafter all.
It took them way too\nlong to catch him.
Did you hear? The\nguy who slammed into\nyou was caught.
Did that really\nwarrant a special\nnews report?
What was the name of\nMiyazawa's channel\nagain?
This place seems to\nhave good ratings.\nLet's eat here.
How'd they get such\ngood reviews? The\nservice stinks.
Wasn't that gourmet\nreview show on\ntoday?
That's fake, right?\nNo way it looks like\nthe photo.
Nothing beats the\nusual go-to!
There are too many\npeople making food\nreview videos.
A one-year wait for\na reservation?\nUnbelievable.
Every store\nhas a line.
Let's just go get\nramen from\nVictory Kitchen.
When will that shop\nin Zoshigaya reopen?
Oh, Miyazawa just\nposted some kind of\nannouncement.
I want to eat fine\ncuisine from all\nover the world.
Diet first... Then I'm\ngonna go all out\nat a buffet!
I want to be\na gourmet critic too.
Nothing beats a\nhearty home-cooked\nmeal.
Let's go to\nShinjuku.
Maybe I'm cursed...\nShould I get my\nfortune told?
That fortune teller\nChihaya in Shinjuku\nis pretty cute.
I have zero\nappetite... Maybe\nit's stress.
I wonder when I'll\nbe able to take\na break...
There's been so many\nnew shops opening\nhere lately.
Online shopping is\nso convenient.
If I had a boyfriend,\nhe would carry my\nbags for me...
These clothes\nare so cute!
Miyazawa's channel\nis gonna bite\nthe dust now!
Without Miyazawa's\nreviews, I dunno\nwhat to eat...
As awful as Miyazawa\nwas, food reviews do\ncome in handy.
That restaurant was\ngreat! I gotta post\npics online.
I want to eat\nsomething delicious.
I've been waiting\nfor a while now...\nWhere are you?
What should I eat?
I've been to all the\nshops around here...
Chinese food really\nis the best\nafter all.
I'm gonna sing\nuntil dawn!
Let's check out\nthat shop.
Sorry to keep\nyou waiting.
That girl's reading\npeople's fortunes.\nIs she legit?
A fortune teller?\nHmm...
Hey, why are you\nstill not here...
Let's go to\nthe bookstore.
There's a lot of\nfood review streams\nthese days.
I'll stop at the\nconvenience store\non my way home.
It's always crowded\nhere no matter what\ntime you come.
Which shop should\nI go to today?
I'm drinking\ntonight!
Choosing is a\nhassle. Let's just\npick any place.
That Subway Slammer\nnever came to\nShinjuku, huh.
I've never run into\nhim, but I'm glad he\nwas arrested.
I've only seen stuff\nabout the Subway\nSlammer online.
There are some real\nsickos out there.
I'm in a\ngood mood today...
Oh no! I'm gonna be\nlate for my date!
What should\nI get her...?
I won't make it in\ntime... But taxis are\nexpensive...
The Subway Slammer\nhas become quite\na hot topic.
Didn't the victims\nreport it to\nthe police?
I don't care\nanymore...
My luck's no good\nlately. Maybe I'll\ngo to a shrine.
This place has a\nlow rating. Let's go\nsomewhere else.
Takeyuki Kiuchi...\nThe former baseball\npro, right?
Didn't Takeyuki\nKiuchi use to coach\nlittle league?
I went to one of\nthose! Can't believe\nwhat he did.
Why are you\nalways late?
I wonder if there's\na perfect place for\na date...
My heart races every\ntime I see you.
A food fight with a\ngourmet critic?\nSounds boring.
Huh? Seriously?
I found a new shop.
Hurry up and decide\nwhere we're\ngoing already!
Wait a minute...
That's not right.
Nice. I'm gonna\npost this online.
Why haven't you\nbeen texting me\nlately...?
Make sure to take\na good one!
That car looks\nexpensive.
It's a nice shop, so\nwhy are the reviews\nso bad?
Ah, right, right...
Since Miyazawa's\napology, a lot of\ncritics quit...
I don't trust food\ncritics. Not\nafter Miyazawa.
They're still talking\nabout Miyazawa? Who\neven cares?
So Miyazawa screwed\nover that little\nramen place?
Miyazawa ruined\nVictory Kitchen's\nflavor...?
I miss that izakaya.
Honey, I'm here!\nWhere are you?
Today I'll treat\nmyself to a steak.
I miss those\ngarlic-filled\ndumplings.
Ramen... Ramen...
Ahh... Sooo full...
Sorry I'm late!
The shop's too\ncrowded. Where\nshould we go?
Drinks these days\ncome in all sorts of\nweird flavors.
Let's get a drink\nafter we eat!

=== paragraphDes ===
The protagonist moved to Tokyo alone under special circumstances. He reached his new accommodations at the Sakura residence, but...
His new lodgings were in a coffee shop. He was brought to the attic of a place called Caf\xe9 Leblanc...
When the protagonist fell asleep on top of his bed, he awoke to find himself in a mysterious space called "The Velvet Room".
The protagonist went to his new school to introduce himself to the faculty, but was met with a cold welcome. The principal, seemingly annoyed at his presence, warns him not to cause any trouble...
After dumbfoundedly watching Ann enter Kamoshida's car, the protagonist hurried to school with Ryuji. As they drew closer, something strange started to happen around them...
When they arrived at school, they found that it had been transofrmed into a castle-like building straight out of a fairy tale. Upon entering the building, they were immediately surrounded by strange monsters in armor...
The protagonist and Ryuji were thrown into the castle dungeons by strange armored figures. Before they could even come to their senses, a half-naked king with the face of Kamoshida appeared before them!
Listening to the voice, the protagonist remembered events from his past. He recalled his anger at the injustice he had suffered, and with that conviction, his rebellious inner self awakened to fight the injustice that stood before him!
Due to the ordeal in the castle, the protagonist was late on his first day of school, which earned the scorn of the real-world Kamoshida, the other teachers, and his new classmates.
After meeting up with Ryuji again, they discussed the strange castle they saw, and decided to attempt entry once again. As the two struggled in their foreign surroundings, Morgana called out to them...
The Phantom Thieves find themselves in dire straits as they face Kamoshida. Ryuji, unable to fight, can only look on as the others are hurt...
In the real world, Morgana appeared to Ryuji and the protagonist in the form of a cat. As Morgana began to explain how Kamoshida's heart could be changed by using the Palace, Ann's best friend, Shiho, gazed down at the ground from the school rooftop...
The trio once again infiltrated the Palace in an attempt to change Kamoshida's heart. Somehow, Ann has also appeared in this world...
After returning from the real world, the four of them secretly put up calling cards around the school, exposing Kamoshida's evil deeds. The card was signed by "The Phantom Thieves of Hearts".
The Phantom Thieves infiltrated the Palace to steal the Treasure. Twisted by his distorted desires, Kamoshida took on a monstrous, demonic form and attacked them. The Phantom Thieves were cornered...!
A day after stealing the treasure, an unexpected school assembly was held. There, Kamoshida openly confessed to all of his wrongdoing...
During a dinner party celebrating their victory in changing Kamoshida's heart, the protagonist and Ryuji encountered some men in suits. The protagonist felt like he had seen the leader of the men somewhere before...
The criminal prosecutor, Sae Nijima, and the famous high school detective, Goro Akechi, came to pay a visit to Leblanc. The way Akechi spoke about the Phantom Thieves caused the protagonist and Morgana to become wary.
The Phantom Thieves notice a mysterious boy named Yusuke following behind Ann. When they confronted him, Yusuke begged Ann to be a model for his paintings.
Yusuke was a pupil of the famous Japanese painter, Ichiryusai Madarame. The Phantom Thieves were conflicted over what to do with the tickets he gave them to Madarame's upcoming exhibition.
The Phantom Thieves decided to accept Yusuke's invitation to Madarame's exhibition. Just as they arrived, they saw Madarame surrounded by the press, answering questions with a proud yet humble demeanor.
The Phantom Thieves saw a post on the Phan-Site, claiming "a famous Japanese artist is plagiarizing the work of his students.\nThey suspected this message was referring to Madarame, and decided to take action.
Phantom Thieves visited Yusuke's house to investigate. However, he denied everything about the plagiarism accusations against Madarame. Thinking the rumors perhaps referred to a different artist, the Phantom Thieves started to leave the house. However...
The Phantom Thieves discovered a new Palace, and during their infiltration, they encountered its ruler: Shadow Madarame. Showing no remorse, Madarame claimed his actions were a justified reward for taking in and raising orphaned children.
In order to steal the Treasure, they needed to change Madarame's perception. The Phantom Thieves split into two groups and began a coordinated attack from both the real world and the Palace!
When Morgana unlocked a sealed room meant only for Madarame, they found multiple counterfeit copies of "Sayuri". As the doors in the real world unlocked, the closed doors in the Palace changed...
In order to escape from Madarame, Ann activated the Metaverse Navigator, but Yusuke was pulled into Madarame's Palace along with her...
Shadow Madarame admitted to Yusuke that the only reason he took him in was to exploit his talent and reap the benefits for himself. In the midst of his anger and grief from learning the truth, Yusuke awakened his Persona...!
The party unanimously decided to change Madarame's heart. They posted a calling card at Madarame's exhibition, setting the stage to steal his Treasure!
After a fierce battle, the Phantom Thieves finally defeated Shadow Madarame and obtained his Treasure: the posthumous work of Yusuke's mother\u2014the real "Sayuri"!
Madarame held a press conference, where he tearfully confessed to plagiarism and the abuse of his students. This live broadcast instantly brought the name of the Phantom Thieves into the public spotlight.
Yusuke moved out of the school dorms and, with nowhere else to go, temporarily stayed at Leblanc with the protagonist. The Phantom Thieves decided to throw a party to celebrate Madarame's change of heart...
After completing their heist, the Phantom Thieves discussed how to move forward. Finding renewed ambition within themselves, they became all the more determined to stand up against corruption.
Ryuji spies a flyer for a maid housekeeping service in the mail. As he shows it to the protagonist, he suggests that they call a maid.
The protagonist, Ryuji, and Mishima, who overheard their conversation, snuck into an empty apartment and called for a maid... but the moment they hung up the phone, Ryuji and Mishima freaked out, and hid out on the balcony.
At school, the Phantom Thieves discussed their next move, when Makoto, the student council president, approached them...
Makoto had recorded the Phantom Thieves' discussion on her phone, and used it to blackmail them into changing someone's heart for her.
The protagonist got in touch with the journalist they met during the Maradame heist, and uncovered the name of Makoto's target: Kaneshiro. The Phantom Thieves proceeded to search for his Palace...
The Phantom Thieves managed to locate Kaneshiro's palace, but with his fortress floating in the sky, they had no way to reach it.
Out of desperation, Makoto tracked down Kaneshiro in the real world and tried to confront him...
The Phantom Thieves rushed to Kaneshiro's club to help Makoto, only to wind up falling into Kaneshiro's trap.
Now that Kaneshiro recognized Makoto as a customer of his bank, the Phantom Thieves realized this might be their ticket into his Palace, and brought Makoto along with them to the Metaverse.
Just as they had hoped, the Phantom Thieves managed to infiltrate Kaneshiro's palace with Makoto's help. There, they encounter Kaneshiro's shadow.
Shadow Kaneshiro offered a disgusting "payment plan" to clear their debt to him. Hearing this sent Makoto into a rage and awakened her Persona.
After investigating the Palace, the Phantom Thieves returned to the real world to deliver their calling card to Kaneshiro.
The Phantom Thieves confronted Shadow Kaneshiro at the heart of his Palace, and witnessed his grotesque transformation.
In their intense battle against Shadow Kaneshiro, the Phantom Thieves unleashed an all-out attack...!
After his defeat, Shadow Kaneshiro made a shocking revelation to the Phantom Thieves right before disappearing...
Thanks to the Phantom Thieves' efforts, Kaneshiro's heart was changed and he surrendered himself to the police. But as Sae watched the news on TV, her expression remained stern.

A young thief battled against a masked adversary in what appeared to be a casino. The person beneath the mask looks just like...
I need to fill out my career questionnaire, but I have no clue what to write...
I had this strange dream where I met an old man called Igor and a woman called Merope... But was it really just a dream...?
People's desires seem to be fading all at once... Something strange is happening to the world.
Finding myself suddenly lost in the Metaverse, I was attacked by a terrifying shadow... Just as I was about to meet my fate, I heard a voice...
Upon revisiting the Velvet Room, Igor and Merope warned me that a terrible future of ruin awaited.
I happened to run into my neighbor, Kayo Tomiyama, who's friends with my mom. She... certainly likes to talk...
On the way to school, I found a train pass with a baseball mitt keychain attached to it. I need to return it to its owner.
Motoha Arai, the girl who sits in front of me in class, told me about the popular site, Divine Justice, and its administrator, Magatsukami.
In class, I met up with Tomoko Noge, the girl whose train pass I found. It turns out she's best friends with Motoha.
Up on the school rooftop, Lufel explained to me about the Metaverse and shadows. It seems that he has something he wishes to ask me.
At Shibuya Station, I witnessed the misdeeds of the Subway Slammer, Takeyuki Kiuchi. It seems that in order to stop him, I must become a Phantom Thief and delve into the Metaverse...
In Mementos, we discovered a red vortex. According to Lufel, it's the entrance to a palace.
Apparently Motoha and Kiuchi have a troubled past. Motoha believed that it's her fault he retired from baseball.
During the confrontation with Kiuchi's shadow, Motoha freed herself from burden of her past, and found the will to fight. At that moment, something changed within her...
When Lufel explained to Motoha about the Phantom Thieves and their plan to change Kiuchi's heart, she agreed to join us without hesitation.
In the palace, we saw a video of Kiuchi's past. Motoha thought that she had injured Kiuchi, but the truth paints a different picture...
Having secured the route to the Treasure, we prepared ourselves for the upcoming battle. The time has come to send our first calling card.
Kiuchi's shadow awaited us in the depths of his palace. Will Motoha be able to settle her past with Kiuchi once and for all?
We headed to Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku to celebrate our victory over ramen, but Motoha couldn't help but feel there's something different about the taste.
Seeing Kiuchi's arrest on the news, we became all the more determined to carry on with our Phantom Thief activities.
Celebrity food critic Hiromu Miyazawa is plotting to claim the management rights to Victory Kitchen, but it seems like there's someone else pulling the strings.
In order to locate the next palace, we delved back into Mementos, and noticed that some changes had occurred since we claimed Kiuchi's treasure...
Shun Kano introduced us to the ramen of Heritage Kitchen, and Motoha immediately noticed that it had the taste she remembers. Though it seems that Miyazawa plans to get his hands on this restaurant, as well...
Lufel is certain that Miyazawa must be a Palace ruler, so we decided to make him our next target.
We found a poster inside Miyazawa's palace featuring Shun. It seems that the upcoming Food Fight is all part of Miyazawa's scheme...
Inside the palace, we found ourselves cornered by Miyazawa's shadow. At that moment, a new power awakened within Shun...
The Phantom Thieves commenced our exploration of Miyazawa's palace along with our newest member, Shun. First we'll need to secure a route to the Treasure.
With our calling card sent to Miyazawa, all the preparations are in order. It's only a matter of time before the big showdown...
Miyazawa's desires had been distorted from his failure to become the true professional he always aspired to be. Left dejected from his defeat, Miyazawa is approached by Shun...
After our showdown against Miyazawa's shadow, we made our return to the real world, when something unexpected happens...
Miyazawa held a press conference where he confessed to his crimes. The results of his change of heart were even greater than we expected.
The academic coordinator introduced the rest of the faculty to Kei Akashi, a new teacher. He appears mild-mannered, although he seems to have something planned involving Ms. Katayama...
A Shadow that was defeated once before has suddenly appeared again. What is going on here?
Who was that person running around late at night?
Riko-senpai formally introduced everyone to Kei Akashi, the new teacher. He gave a good first impression, but Ms. Katayama seems to hold a different opinion of him...
Ms. Katayama has been condemned as a Menace, but there must be more to this than meets the eye...
Impossible... That crazy delivery cyclist was Ms. Katayama all along!?
Lufel told us it was possible that Ms. Katayama may have a Palace. Shun was doubtful at first, but it turns out Lufel was right.
Within the dam-like Palace, the Phantom Thieves encounter a suspicious figure. Motoha thinks they bear a striking resemblance to Kei Akashi...
Pops Yamagoshi and Masa told us about Ms. Katayama's past. It's like they're describing a completely different person...
Ms. Katayama has been suspended. This was a completely unexpected development, and we think Akashi must be behind it. We set off to investigate him, but then Riko-senpai showed up...
Riko tells us about Ms. Katayama's strange behavior, and it seems that Akashi is somehow behind it all. We're going to work together to get to the bottom of this.
Riko comes to the Palace with us, and Lufel recognizes her potential as a Phantom Thief.
Continuing deeper into the Palace, we found a projector. It showed us the history of Ms. Katayama and Riko-senpai...
Riko-senpai faces her true self, and the winds of fate begin to blow...
Riko was able to open up about her true feelings to Ms. Katayama, which seemed to spur her on...
We returned to Mementos with Riko, and decided on her new code name.
Akashi makes his entrance, and Ms. Katayama is forced into a fierce battle with us...
Riko said she could help lay a trap for Akashi, but just needs a little time to get things ready.
In order to help Ms. Katayama, Riko sets her plan into motion.
Riko proposed a strategy that would not require anyone to be sacrificed, but there seemed to be a flaw in the plan...
The Palace reopens, and we unexpectedly meet Yamanashi's shadow.
We saw Akashi's past in the Palace. Despite what happened to him, it does not absolve him of his crimes.
We learned about Akashi's past. Now we leave it to Riko to come up with our next move.
I keep having the same dream. What could it mean?
A puzzle rally is being held at Shibuya Station Square, and a young girl and I notice an error in one of the puzzles.
Haruna Nishimori has been offered early acceptance to a university in the US, and as a token of her gratitude for the puzzle rally, she sent me a riddle.
While exploring the underground shopping district with Haruna Nishimori and her friends, we unexpectedly ran into her old playmate.
Shota is upset that his old playmate Haruna is going away to college in the US. It seems like he misses playing with her.
Haruna gave me a puzzle and asked me to deliver it to Shota. Shota and I explored the city solving all of Haruna's puzzles until we reached the end.
I met a girl named Minami who was looking after some kids in the neighborhood. She seemed to have her hands full, so I offered to lend her a hand.
Minami has been looking after the children to help out the people of the neighborhood.
Minami has a dream to become a nurse, but seems reluctant to tell her father about it.
Minami wants to pursue her dream, but she's worried about her family's shop... She decides to open up to her father about her ambitions.
Minami and her father are finally able to speak openly to one another, and at last, the unease in her heart has faded away.
Motoha realized just how fixated she had been on competing with Tamayo. Having remembered her original reason to stay in shape, the weight is lifted off her shoulders.
Although Motoha was defeated in her contest against Tamayo, she seems relieved, having come to terms with her current self.
Motoha has become all the more determined to work hard as part of the Phantom Thieves, for the sake of her and everybody's future.
I happened to meet a vivacious older lady in Shinjuku, and she helped me out when I was getting harassed by some drunk guy...
It turns out Chizuko's granddaughter is the girl I saw jump off a rooftop... She's concerned about how to help her granddaughter recover after the incident.
It seems that Merope is particularly intrigued by the concept of idols...
Merope insisted that there is much to be learned from idols, as they, too, must wear many masks.
Merope explained the necessity of idol poses to me, and seemed quite pleased when I pulled them off...
I went with Merope to Akihabara, where she met her new favorite idol, Narumi Nashimoto.
Merope took me to the concept caf\xe9 that Narumi works at. As Merope made her order, I could tell she had done her research...
Yaoling felt bad about potentially hurting Yukimi's feelings, and planned to invite her out to tea again to make up with her.
Merope noticed some disruptive fans at Narumi's photo session and stood up to them for her favorite idol.
Narumi's caf\xe9 is being run by a corrupt producer. We'll make him pay for exploiting these idols.
Having successfully changed the corrupt producer's heart, peace has been restored to the concept caf\xe9. Narumi gave us a special ticket to her event as thanks for our support.
In order to prepare for Narumi's fan appreciation event, I practiced my cheering with Merope.
After joining the Phantom Thieves, Motoha felt that she needed to build up her strength, and asked me to be her fitness coach.
I went to the batting cages with Motoha, but she wasn't able to swing like she used to...
Motoha and I decided to hit the gym. Working out with the dumbbells was tougher than I thought.
It seems that Kotone's traumatic past has her reluctant to return to competing. Tomoko wonders what she can do to help her out.
Tomoko thought back to her baseball days, and came up with an idea to encourage Kotone with a cheer song.
Kotone was overjoyed by the cheer song. Seeing her motivated helped regain Tomoko's confidence and find hope for the future.
Rest is an essential part of training, so Motoha and I enjoyed eating to our hearts' content at the diner.
Motoha and I returned to the batting cages, but she still hasn't reached her former glory. There, we met Tamayo Yoshida, who considers Motoha her rival.
Determined not to lose to Tamayo, Motoha trained non-stop at the batting cages, but it seemed like her precision was getting worse...
Tamayo explained to me about her admiration for Motoha, and insisted that Motoha hasn't lost her passion for baseball.
I met an exchange student from China called Yaoling, who was having some difficulties with buying veggies at the supermarket
Puzzled by various aspects of life in Japan, Yaoling asked me to be her "sensei."
Yaoling and I browsed the stores of Jinbocho, and she found many things that took her fancy.
Yaoling and I headed to the cultural hub of Harajuku. She was amazed by everything there from fashion to food.
At the tea party, Yaoling expressed her honest feelings to Yukimi, and the two of them were able to come to an understanding.
Yaoling had long been wondering what was the purpose of her exchange in Japan, but it seems that she finally found her answer.
Yaoling and I happened to see her neighbor, Yukimi Fujikawa, being berated by her mother. Yukimi looked pretty upset...
Yaoling and I invited Yukimi on a trip to Asakusa to cheer up Yukimi, We all had a great time, and Yukimi said she wanted to return the favor.
Yaoling made a difficult request to the staff at Yukimi's favorite restaurant, and struggled to understand Yukimi's perspective.
Tomoko decided to take up part-time jobs in order to find a new goal for the future. I lent her a hand by working at the cr\xeape shop with her.
Tomoko and I worked a shift at the beef bowl restaurant, and managed to catch a customer who was trying to cause trouble.
Tomoko and I took up a job at a convenience store. No matter the task, she always devotes herself to the job at hand.
While working a shift at the drugstore, Tomoko and I met the famous figure skater, Kotone Montagne.
While working part-time at an accessory shop, Tomoko opened up to me about her anxieties.
Tomoko and I were working at a flower shop, when we happened to see Kotone again. She had come to buy a bouquet for her coach.
After finishing up a shift at the diner, we bumped into Kotone again, and the three of us decided to share a big bowl of pasta together.
Tomiyama came to me for advice on how to interact with young people, and I agreed to help her out.
Tomiyama is shocked to discover that her lingo is out of date...
Tomiyama prefers to pay by cash, and just can't seem to understand cashless payments.
Tomiyama's nephew, Leo Kamiyama, is training to become a costumed stuntman.
Tomiyama is thinking of making him a special bento to encourage Leo for his upcoming audition.
Leo unfortunately failed the audition. He seemed uncertain of how he was meant to perform...
Tomiyama wants to cheer Leo up, but she's at a loss for what to do.
Tomiyama told me that Leo ran away from home. In order to help both of them out, I have to go and talk to Leo...
Tomiyama and Leo were finally able to open up to one another. After talking things through, Leo has decided to move out and live by himself.
Through looking after Leo, Tomiyama learned a lot about herself. Now she's better prepared for the next time she meets a young person in need.
Shun told me of his plans for the future, and asked me to join him on his quest to find his ideal flavor, by touring the local ramen shops.
Shun and I tried a secret menu item at a monjayaki restaurant. The taste was greater than he imagined...
A takeout spot's soupless tantanmen has caught Shun's eye. When we order it, he's impressed by all the care the shop put into its preparation.
Shun and I tried what appeared to be ordinary curry ramen at first glance, but led to him reminiscing about his childhood.
Takumi Serizawa, a notable food consultant, approaches Shun. Having seen the Food Fight, Serizawa proposes a new opportunity.
Shun comes up with the ramenburger for the gourmet competition. Well, it certainly is innovative...
Serizawa asked for innovation, but the ramenburger doesn't fit the bill.
Shun is in high spirits as we visit the familiar Heritage Kitchen. Our orders of fried rice come with a helpful clue.
Shun creates a ramen that can be enjoyed by one and all. His way of thinking seems to have Serizawa impressed.
Shun successfully earns a spot in the competition, but in his quest to find the perfect flavor, his journey still continues.
While playing the declining Harvest World Online, I met a girl with deep pockets named Yui.
Yui quickly turned the wild fields into prime farmland. After some discussion, the two decided to plant potatoes.
While tending to the field, Yui begins to open up. She seems to have a lot on her mind.
I made a promise to meet Yui's "friend" in person.
I went to eat burgers with Yui's friend, and learned about her life.
The potato field was ravaged by virtual pests. Devastated by the sight, Yui logged out then and there.
Yui found that I had resolved the pest problem and saved the potato plants. This seemed to raise her spirits and encourage her to keep doing her best.
Yui is energetically plowing the field. She seems to be back to her old self.
I went shopping with Yui's friend Musubi Matsukata. With a love for gardening, she picks up a potted basil plant.
The change of heart was successful, and the man came by to personally apologize to Shiina. She was surprised, and wonders how I did it...
With her confidence restored, Shiina gets to work practicing cocktail mixing for the competition. Eventually, after she's had a few too many, she opens up to me...
Although Shiina didn't win the competition in the end, she gained a lot from the experience. In particular, the memories we made together...
Yui seems to be free of her worries. She has found a new goal for herself in the virtual world.
In the school library, I met a strange boy who calls himself the chosen one.
Kiyoshi Kurotani discovered a piece of land at school where plants can't grow, and we decided to investigate the secrets of these harrowed grounds together.
The eerie sound of a woman's crying echoes through the dark of a certain school hallway. What kind of secrets are hidden in this hall of lament?
There's a mysterious juice that is always out of stock, but no one alive has ever bought. Could there be an assassin in our midst?
Through the chosen one's efforts, the truth behind the Assassin's Juice is about to be revealed. Will he have to unleash his secret power against the forces of evil?
An AV room that devours students, a letter hidden in a shoe locker... Is it a love confession, or does the sender have more sinister intentions in mind?
When a hero tries to save the day, what happens when people don't want to be saved? Life isn't easy, even for the chosen ones...
The wind howls fiercely, as the time to toughen up and face our fears has come. Now face the storm and let your heart scream out!
Charge head-on into friendship without fearing the consequences.
Gather your courage and follow your heart! After all, we're the chosen ones!
While passing by a bar in Shibuya, I met a young woman who works there. But then I was caught in a "sudden downpour"...
In order to help more people enjoy the world of cocktails, Shiina has been practicing some non-alcoholic varieties. She says I'm her favorite customer...
Somehow, my conversation with Shiina turned to the topic of her university days...
As I've been visiting the bar more often, I've been getting closer to Shiina and learning more about the art of bartending...
A passing comment by a customer seems to have awakened memories of the past for Shiina. I cheered her up by making her a cocktail...
The manager passed along an application for a flair bartending contest to Shiina, but she seems troubled by something...
At the bar, Shiina encounters the man who once shattered her confidence and stole her desires. But this time, she won't let him win!
As I was passing through Shibuya Station Square, I noticed a girl who was standing there just holding a guitar... Why wasn't she playing it?
The first time I heard Ayaka Sakai play the guitar, I was blown away by the quality of her sound. Even more surprising was the lack of reaction from anyone else passing by... But then, a girl approached...
Ayaka seems to be feeling poorly, and confided her worries in me... The girl we met before was one of her former bandmates from high school, but they went their separate ways...
When we're alone together, Ayaka finally works up the courage to sing for the first time while she plays guitar. She has a beautiful voice, and I want to help her overcome her lack of confidence...
To help Ayaka with her street performance, I revealed my secret weapon - a tambourine! Our duet concert was a success.
Ayaka is feeling more confident and decided to write a new song. She seems to have been inspired by our time together and was able to put her feelings into words and music. I hope she can continue to shine.
When I met up with Ayaka this time, she seemed to be feeling down again. She told me her former bandmate has now given up on music altogether. Is there anything I can do to cheer Ayaka up?
At a small concert in Inokashira Park, Ayaka talked about her progress with her songwriting, her happy memories of the past, and... her feelings for me. How should I respond?
Ayaka played her new song for me, which is still a work in progress. The melody conveys gentle, yet intense, emotions that sway the heart...
The new song received an overwhelmingly positive response. The songwriting process helped Ayaka rediscover why she makes music in the first place. She's going to continue pursuing her dreams, and the journey will never end...
I met a girl performing a puppet show in Shinjuku. When the police were talking to her, she seemed to be deliberately hiding her identity...
Miyu got into some trouble during a performance in Shinjuku, but I called the police and they chased the troublemakers off. Miyu expressed her gratitude, and promised she will tell me more when the opportunity arises.
Miyu has moved her performances to Kichijoji now. I met with her at a restaurant, where she told me about her dream of becoming a puppeteer, and her conflict with her parents...
Miyu's performance in Kichijoji was a success. As she told the story of the Little Mermaid, she earnestly expressed the mermaid's desire to stand on her own two feet...
During Miyu's street performance, I was able to prevent an incident from a man in black who had been interrupting her performances countless times before. She was grateful for my protection and said she'd call me her "Big Bro" from now on.
Miyu started her performance in Kichijoji once again, but the mysterious man in black tried to get in the way once again. She thinks she may have an idea who he is...
The man in black forcibly took Miyu's belongings and broke her puppets. She realizes that he was sent by her parents, and feels deeply saddened by that...
Miyu invited me to visit all kinds of different places with her. At the aquarium, she opened up about her insecurities, and said very earnestly that I've helped her find new strength. How should I respond...?
The Street Artist Festival was canceled by Miyu's parents. Feeling personally responsible, a dejected Miyu decided to give up on her dream and return home to face her parents directly. I need to do something to fix their distorted desires...
I was able to change the hearts of Miyu's parents, and the Street Artist Festival went on as planned. No longer feeling like she was lost and adrift, Miyu decided to stop using her stage name "Jellie" and will perform with her real name now. She thanked me for helping her stand on her own two feet.
An abnormality with the Metaverse Navigator sent the Phantom Thieves to a strange castle.
As they continued in a daze, the Phantom Thieves faced an unexpected encounter.
The Phantom Thieves encountered two unknown Thieves, Mona and Skull, and established an alliance with them.\nThey don't recall anything good about the place.
The Phantom Thieves continued feeling their way forward in search of the Core.\nThe interior of the castle could hardly be described as being in good taste.
The Phantom Thieves fought their way to the underground prison.\nThere, they came across a lost teammate confined to a cell.
I met a strange man dressed as a doctor at the arcade in Shibuya. He seems to be pretty good at shooting games, and I think he might be able to help me hone my own gaming skills...
When he's in the gaming zone, Kitazato's personality seems to undergo a frightening transformation... He's now asked me to help him with some kind of experiment, but I have no idea what that could mean...
Kitazato explained his reasoning to me. He has noticed that many of his patients seem to be losing their desire to live, and to test out his hypothesis, he has been observing the reactions of his opponents in the shooting game. He seems to detect something special in me...
Kitazato may have impressive medical knowledge, but his social skills seem a bit lacking... Despite the efforts of his doting older sister, he's never learned how to interact with women...
We encountered a couple of problem customers at the arcade, and challenged them to a shooting game match. After a hard-won victory, the other patrons were inspired, and found the courage to chase the troublemakers out.
Kitazato unexpectedly told me he was cancelling his experiment. When I pressed him for more info, he said that one of his patients had chosen to opt out of surgery, despite the potential for a cure. The patient's decision shocked him...
Kitazato told the patient about his past and his reasons for becoming a doctor. He once had a young patient who, despite their strong will to survive, unfortunately passed away. The patient was moved by Kitazato's desire to save lives while there is still hope...
After changing the heart of Kitazato's mentor, his surgery plan was approved and he was given the go-ahead to operate. He's not sure what caused the sudden change, but he gladly accepted the opportunity...
As the scheduled operation draws nearer, Kitazato seems to be feeling nervous. I need to help him put aside his doubts, so that he doesn't betray his patient's hard-earned trust...
The Metaverse Navigator started malfunctioning again, and we were whisked away to some unknown location.
I had a chance encounter with Masaki Ashiya, a senior from Kokatsu Academy, at the flower shop. He seems very kind, and a bit more sociable than I expected...
Ashiya-senpai treated me to some high-quality sushi, but considering we just met, a gift like this seems a bit much...
Ashiya-senpai seems to have noticed how awkward his gifts make me feel, and to make it up to me, he gave me... an even more awkward gift...
I worked a part-time job with Ashiya-senpai, and saw his keen skills of observation. Even when dealing with complaints, he has an unshakeable resolve...
Ashiya-senpai was in a panic after hearing his mother was injured in an accident. In the end, it turned out to be a false alarm... but I feel like this experience brought us a little closer together.
As we've gotten closer, Ashiya-senpai has become more caring and attentive. He even took care of me when I was feeling under the weather...
As he continues to worry about others, Ashiya-senpai starts to realize he may have a habit of being overprotective...
A city appeared before us in the desert, and as we discussed what to do, we heard a girl's voice calling out for help...
The girl we helped out introduced herself as Oracle, another one of Joker's Phantom Thief allies.
Inside the massive pyramid, we were reunited with Queen, Fox, Panther, and Skull.
Oracle explained that the snake, rooster and pig recognized three kinds of poison: Greed, Hatred, and Envy, respectively.
As soon as we got the Core, we were immediately transported to someplace new. This time it's some sort of factory filled with machinery. And once again, we heard a voice...
How can we understand this "dance of love"? Perhaps we could try going on a date to the amusement park...
Kotone couldn't understand the theme of the choreography at all, and her coach wasn't too happy with her... She came to me for some advice.
Even if I don't mean it, Kotone wants to hear me say the words "I love you..."
Kotone took me with her as she danced on the ice, and we talked about her many worries. However, she was glad that her dance caught my eye...
Apparently rumors have started that Kotone and I are dating, and she's been feeling a bit flustered...
I told Kotone her performance was beautiful, but she doesn't seem satisfied with that answer. Was there something more she wanted to hear?
Kotone was floored when Coach Kuroe decided to retire, but I was there to help her get back up...
I accompanied Kotone to a clothing store so we could get some ideas for her competition outfit, and discuss some other important matters. Afterwards, she confessed what "love" means to her...
Kotone was able to remain calm and professional in front of the mass media. The reporter who had secretly photographed us before changed their tune after seeing Kotone's dance, and hearing some words from her coach...
Filled with love for everyone, Kotone gave her greatest performance yet during practice...
The operation was a success, the patient's hope for life was restored, and Kitazato's mentor recognized his ability. Afterwards, I promised to continue supporting Kitazato's work, and everything seems to be going well...
In an area called the Training Hall of Love, the Phantom Thieves witnessed the unfair treatment of a cognitive being.
Ashiya-senpai reflected on what happened last time, and told me about his past...
A little help was enough for the flowers to bloom on their own.
Over time, Ashiya-senpai and I have become true friends. Finally, he has gathered his courage and asked me what he's wanted to say all along: "Want to come over to my house?"
With Joker's return, all allies have finally assembled.\nThe Phantom Thieves set out once more in pursuit of the Core.
The Phantom Thieves have finally arrived at the heart of the castle.\nCan they successfully steal the Core?
It feels like I just infiltrated a Palace.\nWhile caught up in my thoughts, I stick my hands in my pockets and...
We've wound up in a mysterious area again. I wonder if our old friends could be here as well.
We met a guy named Fox. He's an interesting person, and gets along very well with Shun.
Fox looks back on his past, and even though it's over, the wounds in his heart may still take time to heal.
We ran into Mona and Skull again. It feels like no matter where we go, their presence eases the tension.
Something's off... We got the Core, so why isn't the Palace collapsing?
Looking at the towering Palace in the distance, Mona says it feels somewhat nostalgic. With no other choice, we decided to go and check it out...
Ahead there was a building resembling a bank, and Fox and Panther recalled past events. While they were talking, Motoha appeared with a new ally named Queen.
Seeing the familiar place reminded Skull and the others of the time they first met Queen.
I enjoyed hearing everyone talk about what they'd do if they were rich... I hope their dreams come true.
We made it to the underground vault and met up with Joker. All that's left now is to get that Core!
We successfully took the Core, and now it's time to say our goodbyes once more. But I'm sure we'll meet again eventually...
I'm headed to the beach with my friends! We're going to enjoy this trip to the fullest.
The water gun fight seems like a pretty exciting event.
It's our destiny as Phantom Thieves to eradicate the influence of the Metaverse.
It's finally time to meet up with Joker again. How is he going to make his entrance this time?
We came across a lot of damaged and broken robots, and it's probably an accurate reflection of the state of the company's employees in the real world. The realization brings back some painful memories for Noir...
While we were talking about Big Bang Burger, Motoha realized that this chain doesn't seem to exist in our world...
A Palace in outer space? I didn't realize that was even possible...
The Core has been acquired! Time to make our exit!
Just one taste of shaved ice brings back those happy summer memories. No trip to the beach would be complete without it!
Our trip will be over before we know it... We made a lot of great memories here.

That day, even though I did what thought was right...\nI was sued and forced to move to Tokyo...
The owner of the caf\xe9 is called Sojiro Sakura.\nI will be staying here for the next year.
While we were walking to school...\nSomething strange happened.
On the first day of school, it rained heavily.\nSeeking shelter from the rain, I ended up beside another student...
A castle appeared right before our eyes.\nIs this really the school?
That day... I was late getting home that night. I witnessed a drunken man aggressively harassing a woman.\nI couldn't just ignore it, so I stepped in to stop him. However\u2014\n"Damn brat... I'll sue!"
Even though I did what was right, I was forced to leave my hometown and move to Tokyo by myself. Did I do something wrong after all...?
I arrived at Caf\xe9 Leblanc.\nAs I opened the door, there was a pleasnt ding from a bell.\nThe owner of Leblanc slowly stood up and introduced himself as Sojiro Sakura.
Sojiro is my guardian while I'm in Tokyo. For the next year, until my "probation" is lifted, I will be living on the second floor of this shop.
And for that year, I will be attending Shujin Academy. Sojiro Sakura warned me, "If you cause any trouble, you'll be sent to juvenile hall."
As the female student entered the car,\nonly a vulgar boy remained...\n"Dammit... Screw that pervy teacher!"\n"Who does he think he is\u2014the king of a castle?"\nIt looks like he's a Shujin Academy student too.\nIt also seems like he has a lot going on right now.
"This rain ain't too bad. We better hurry up, or we'll be late." Despite his appearance, he seems like a good guy. I started heading toward the school with him...

Two Thieves
Pardon me, darlin', got a sec? You see, every time Orobas comes 'round, he's flappin' his gums about elegance and grace. It's enough to make a lady's ears turn red! Someone needs to rein in that holier-than-thou attitude. Got any stylish friends who could humble him a bit?
Bless her heart, that Leanan Sidhe ain't got a soul to confide in. You reckon there's a cheerful gentleman out there who'd be willin' to talk with her? They'd best be resilient enough to resist her temptations... or to thick to even notice.
Well, I'll be! That high-and-mighty Neko Shogun's gone and made off with my merchandise and refuses to return it! Maybe a fellow feline could sweet-talk 'em into doin' the right thing. Know any cats with a silver tongue?
Now, I don't mean to fuss, but a Shiisaa's been out on the road practicin' their lion dance like they're tryin' to summon a rainstorm. Gotta say, it's mighty impressive, but they've gone and blocked the whole dang road! Perhaps if someone joined in, they'd move along. Know anyone with fancy footwork like that?
Y'all ever heard of a shadow named Alice? That poor young girl's always by her lonesome. Seems to me she could sure use a friend. Reckon you know anyone who could keep her company?
I heard them Mandrakes can be used to whip up some sorta cure-all potion. Trouble is, every time I try to get near one, they skedaddle faster than a jackrabbit while screamin' bloody murder! Don't suppose you know someone who knows a lot about medicine and got the patience to deal with 'em?
That Ame-no-Uzume's got moves that'd make the angels jealous. But I can't help but wonder if she ever gets tired of always dancing by her lonesome. Got any friends who'd be up for joining her?
Well, bless my stars! There's a Treasure Demon guardin' a secret entrance. What do ya reckon's hidin' in there? Bet it's somethin' shiny and worth a fortune! I bet we could get them to move if we throw 'em somethin' soft and round... if you catch my drift.
That old rubber ball made the Treasure Demon happier than a dog with two tails! But who'd've known that secret entrance led to a baseball stadium!? I must confess, I don't really know anythin' about sports... Could any of your friends show me around?
There's a whole stash of rare stuff sittin' in that stadium! But I can't get even a hair closer to any of it with that aggressive pitching machine standin' guard. If you know a batter good enough to hit them balls outta the park, we might just be able to grab the goods. I'll give ya a fair slice of the spoils!
Would ya look at that. Another secret entrance! That Treasure Demon, though, don't seem to care none 'bout that rubber ball no more. It's askin' for something rectangular and flat... I'm stumped for ideas on what that could be\u2014how 'bout you?
That Treasure Demon was happier than a rooster in a henhouse when I showed it that Movie Ticket Stub! Turns out that secret entrance leads to an old Japanese castle of sorts, but lemme tell ya, it's got traps nastier than a snake in the grass. Now it really feels like somethin' out of a movie. If you got any pals who know a thing or two 'bout this place, I'd appreciate their help gettin' around!
My stars, have you ever seen a castle this big? I thought castles were supposed to be old, too... but what's with all these cameras? I ain't got the brains for these puzzles either, so if you know someone who does, I'll make sure you get a cut of the treasure!
Well, sugar, business ain't been too hot lately... But I heard folks'll buy just 'bout anything if there's a cute mascot peddlin' it. You reckon people are really that easy to win over? Could you be a dear and find me a cute mascot before I have to file for bankruptcy?
Land sakes, that Shadow Bessa is drivin' me up the wall... Keeps harpin' on about findin' guests for their show's opening ceremony. I'd be much obliged if you could round up your friends with pizzazz and sparkle, that's sure to get 'em off my back so I can get back to my deliveries!
I've been mullin' over the idea of startin' a new store 'round here... But that Jack Frost's got the roads slipperier than a snake in a bucket of oil. If you know anyone who's got a knack for skatin', send 'em my way, would ya?
Well, bless my heart, this next delivery's a hike and a half. I'd usually just hoof it, but I'm feelin' mighty low on energy. Know anyone who can give me a ride to the destination?
I've got a delivery that's hotter than a skillet on a summer day! Problem is, it's gotta stay that way. You know anyone who could help me keep it nice 'n' warm?
Y'all won't believe this\u2014I found a spot loaded with rare items! But, wouldn't ya figure, it's swarmin' with Shadows. If you know anyone who's good at fightin' in a team, they'd be just the ticket!
Urgh... lately, some downright frightenin' Shadows have been swipin' my goods from right under me! I'm at my wit's end now with these bandits. Say, got any strong friends who can give them no-good vermin a good thumpin' for me?
Well, shoot... the ringleader of them bandit Shadows came struttin' over and threatened to clean me out for good next time. I don't know how much more my little shop can take. I'm gonna need some friends of yours to work security for me in case he comes back.
This new order's some kinda heavy steel gizmo... looks like it might be a weapon? My shop ain't exactly set up for this sorta thing, but as a pro, I refuse to shy away from the challenge! Got any friends who know their weapons?
I've been tryin' to get some new trade routes up and runnin', but them Shadows done blocked the way. It's a real pain for business, lemme tell ya. I hear they'll let ya through if you can outmuscle 'em, but I ain't up for that kinda thing. Say, any of them pals of yours any good at taking out single enemies?
Well, ain't that just my luck. Them bandit Shadows are back, and this time, there's a whole swarm of 'em! I can't focus on my deliveries with all this trouble brewin'. Got any strong pals who could put 'em in their places for me?
That ol' bandit Shadow leader just don't know when to quit. He's got himself a bunch of strong bodyguards taggin' along. Things're about to get a li'l dicey 'round here. Sorry to trouble ya again, but I sure could use your help.
Oof... Today's delivery is heavier than a mule in the mud! Just how am I expected to drag around something like this all by myself? I betcha this would be a breeze if I had the wind at my back! Any of your friends know how to whip up a gust or two?
I've been thinkin' of openin' a new trade route for my li'l shop. Trouble is, it's riddled with thorns and that ain't safe. Well, 'specially not for someone like me who likes wearin' sandals. Know anyone who can rescue me from this predicament?
Well, ain't this somethin'... Them bandit Shadows are back, and it looks like they've brought a whole lot more trouble with 'em. Could ya round up your strongest friends to deal with 'em?
Well, here we go again... That bandit Shadow boss done showed up, and he's brought along a bunch of tough bodyguards. I reckon they're lookin' to steal my goods. Sorry to trouble ya, but I'd be mighty grateful if you could put an end to this.
Got me a delivery of frozen goods, but I reckon the customer won't be too happy if it's all melted by the time I show up. Any chance you know someone who can help keep it cool?
I've got my eye on a new trade route for business, but the area's full of aggressive Shadows that keep ambushin' folks. You reckon you know anybody who's good at defense? Perhaps they could lend me a hand?
Aw, heck... Them bandit Shadows are back at it. You know the ones I mean. And I swear, there's more of 'em now than ever! Where do they keep crawlin' out from? Think your strong buddies could help me out one more time?
Shoot, that leader of them bandit Shadows is back again! Persistent fella, ain't he? Now he's got even more guards taggin' along. Two can play at that game though, right, sugar? Mind sharin' a few of your strongest friends with me? I'll make it worth your while!
I've been thinkin' of sprucin' up my shop lineup with some quirky goodies! How weird, you ask? Well, I've got this rock that can store electricity. Only problem is, it ain't worth much if I don't have a way to charge it. You know someone who can give it a good zap?
Marthym's Shop is expandin' again with a brand-new trade route! It's excitin', sure, but this one's really dark and difficult to navigate. Could any of your friends help support me while I'm out there?
Uh-oh, this ain't good... Them bandit Shadows are back, and they've gone and armed themselves real proper this time. I hate to keep askin', but I'd be mighty grateful of you could ask them strong friends of yours to handle this lickety-split.
Not this nonsense again! That bandit Shadow leader's back, and he's got a whole crew of armored guards tougher than a cast-iron skillet. I'm beggin' ya sugar\u2014you gotta save me!
I've been hearin' folks talk 'bout these things called Attributes lately... Fire, Ice, Wind, Electricity\u2014stuff like that. Reckon understandin' them might help me whip up some better goods. Could you introduce me to anyone who knows a lot about this stuff?
Had some business talks go south on me the other day. Think you might know anyone who could help me polish up my diplomacy skills?
Thank ya kindly for your advice on negotiatin' the other day\u2014it's gonna help me keep my customers smilin'! But I reckon I need to work on my strength, too, seein' as I'm always totin' my wares on my noggin. Got any strong friends who could help with my trainin'?
Turns out there's a whole lot more to them Attributes than I thought\u2014Psychokinesis, Nuclear, Curse, Bless... That's quite the lineup, ain't it? I reckon my shop could make some mighty fine wares usin' them. Say, got any friends who're well-versed in this sorta thing?
I'd like to say a big thank-you for always coming 'round and supportin' my business. I've been rackin' my brain tryin' to figure out how to return the favor, but I just don't know where to start. You reckon any of your friends could give me a few pointers on how to support you?
I can't thank ya enough for all the things you've taught me. I feel like I've grown a whole lot as a small business owner. Now I'm ready to put my skills to the real test. I'm talkin' knowledge, talkin' deals, gettin' in shape\u2014the whole lot. Don't suppose any of those strong pals o' yours could give me a hand?
I stumbled on somethin' odd by the roadside the other day. Looked like a little piece of desire, or maybe a fragment of someone's consciousness\u2014I can't say for sure. But it felt like it might be connected to one of your friends. I'll let ya know where it was, in case you wanna go look.
I got a little favor to ask... Well, I was hopin' to strike up some business with some Shadows, but I gotta say\u2014I'm as nervous as a cow goin' downstairs. You reckon you could ask your friends to help mediate?
Thanks to your efforts, desire's finally returnin' to this gloomy world. Y'know, I've been seein' fragments of consciousness scattered all 'round Mementos. They might be worth collectin', don't ya think? Might be worth askin' them friends of yours to grab 'em for ya.
Dear Loyal Customer, Marthym's Shop would like to sincerely thank you for all your support! As a little token of gratitude, I'll let ya in on somethin' I spotted while I was out makin' deliveries. You'll have to go get it yourself, but I think it's somethin' you won't wanna miss.
I've made up my mind\u2014I'm takin' a trip to learn some new tools of the trade. But I hear it's more dangerous than a hog in a smokehouse out there! If you could lemme borrow a few of your friends, including someone who can keep us healed up, I'd sure feel a whole lot better 'bout this journey.
I came across somethin' real curious\u2014it's a rock! But not just any rock, this one's tougher than a brick house. Think folks'd be interested in durable wares made of this stuff? Hmm... maybe we should give it a good testin' first. Got a few friends who could help us out?
I hear humans are wild for them "bargain sales." Oh, but if I were to do somethin' like that, I'd be busier than a squirrel in a nut factory tryin' to handle all them crowds! Say now, I could do with a power up, and my customers could do with a major power down, if you catch my drift!
Now that I'm expandin' my business, I need to get out there and start new ventures... But land sakes, all the good spots are far off, and I'm feelin' a bit uneasy about goin' it alone. I'd sure appreciate havin' some company so I stay safe while I handle my goods. Got any pals who'd make good bodyguards?
Mementos is lookin' rougher than a tumbleweed in a tornado these days. All these odd desires are stirrin' the Shadows into a frenzy and it's makin' life hard for a small business owner like me. I could definitely benefit from some hired muscle. Could any of your friends shield me from danger?
Oh dearie. My poor little shoulders've been feelin' stiff as a fence post lately. But I can't just up and leave the shop unattended, now can I? Say, maybe you could lend me a hand? If you have any friends that can help support me, why I'd be happier than a pig in the sunshine!
Well, I'll be! I've been feelin' sore as a mule lately, and wouldn't ya know it, turns out an Obariyon's been clingin' to my back like a burr on a hound dog this whole time! I'm supposed to be totin' goods, not this critter. I'd be pleased as punch if you introduce me to your friends who can support me!
Do I have some news for you, honey pie! Did you know that by taking an Obariyon home, you might get a big pile of shiny gold coins? But let me tell ya, it ain't as easy as it sounds. Do a girl a favor and introduce me to some friends who can offer me support, would ya?
Y'all ain't gonna believe this, but I saw somethin' real shiny and rare the other day! Now, you can just imagine my heartbreak when I lost sight of it while I was tendin' to my business... But I reckon I'd like to try huntin' it down again. Don't s'pose you know anybody good at supportin' others who could lend me a hand, do ya?
Guess what? I found me a place just crawlin' with Obariyons! If I can scoop 'em all up, I'll be sittin' on a goldmine. Don't tell me you wouldn't wanna get in on this. Call your friends who can provide support and let's get to it!
Got a minute, hon? There's this oddball Decarabia that keeps stoppin' me in my tracks and roping me into taking its darn quiz... Now, I ain't no good at riddles, and it's throwin' a wrench in my business. Any chance your friends could lend some support?
Well, I'll be darned! That Decarabia's back at it again with another quiz, and this one's tougher than a rusty nail! I'm gonna need your best, most supportive friends for this... I'm beggin' ya\u2014it's for the good of the business!
That aggravatin' Decarabia showed up again, and this time it's got the hardest quiz I've ever seen. I can't even make heads or tails of it! I'll need your best, most supportive friends to help. The shop can't keep runnin' like this!
Well, here we go again\u2014that darn Decarabia's back with an impossible quiz! I'm gonna need some mighty strong support to get through this one. Let's just cross our fingers this is the last of its nonsense!
You know Setanta, right? That Shadow in the tough-lookin' armor... Yeah, that one. Well, he's set up camp by the side of the road and won't let nobody through. If you got any friends who know how to pack a punch, I'd appreciate if you could ask them to get him out of my hair.
Well, ain't this somethin'? That Setanta's back again, callin' himself a gatekeeper and blockin' off the whole dang road. And I mean really blockin' it\u2014ain't nobody gettin' through. I'm gonna need a few of your pals to give him a good thumpin' ASAP.
Whew, I'm up to my neck in new orders, but they're so big and heavy I can hardly budge 'em! You know anybody who's good at focused attacks? I figure someone like that could help me get this merchandise movin'.
Well, ain't this a fine mess? Setanta's back, and lookin' meaner than a snake in a thorn bush. Gettin' whooped last time must've bruised his ego. I need you to round up some friends who can give him a good clobberin' so we can put him in his place for good.
Hey, got a minute? There's a wicked Black Ooze cloggin' up the path and gettin' around it's been a real chore. That thing's made the road sticker than a syrup-soaked pancake! Know anyone strong enough to scrape that blob of tar out of my sight?
Well, shoot! That Black Ooze is back, and it's bigger and meaner than ever. Now the road's all slicked up with its sticky goo, and I'm stuck. Could you round up those tough friends of yours to take it down?
Well, bless my soul! Business is busier than a bee in a flower patch! I've got a whole mess of little packages that need movin'. Got any friends who can blast the lot of 'em all at once? I reckon they'd make short work of this.
Howdy there sweet pea. I have quite the sticky situation on my hands... That Black Ooze is back, and it's bigger than a mule in a mud pit! I'm at a loss. Can you send over a few strong friends to take care of it soon?
Howdy there, I could use your help. This Matador just showed up, wavin' his cape and darin' me to try and get past. What a load of bull... Are any of your friends good at keeping a solid guard up? I could use their help!
Oh dearie me... A couple of Matadors are tauntin' each other. What's a poor li'l business owner to do? If only some kind souls with a knack for defendin' others were to step in... Hint, hint.
Well, butter my biscuit. I've got a fragile order to deliver but I can't shake the feelin' some sneaky Shadows might come sniffin' while I'm at it. Got any friends who are good at defending and offering support? I could do with some protection.
A top-of-the-line merchant such as myself is always ready to handle any situation, but hey, sometimes life throws ya somethin' ya didn't see comin'. I'd sure be grateful if I had a medic on standby.
Well, bless my soul! The other day, I was out stretchin' my legs when I tripped over a Koropokguru. My goods went flyin' everywhere like popcorn in a hot skillet! Looks like it'll be a spell before I'm back in business. I'd be awfully grateful if I had someone to help me get back on my feet.
Well, I've been thinkin' 'bout growin' my business lately, but there's this downright creepy Incubus hangin' 'round, givin' me the heebie-jeebies. I just don't have the strength in me to deal with this. Say, could any of your friends give me a power boost?
Some sneaky Incubus has been causin' a stir, layin' traps here and there. I don't know what that little critter's plannin', but it's sure makin' my life harder. Got any friends who can help me out and give me a buff or two?
That pesky Incubus done called in his buddies... He's lookin' mighty hard\u2014uh, hard to beat, I mean\u2014but this might just be your shot, ya hear? Show him you ain't fallin' for his tricks, and he'll skedaddle faster than a scared possum. Know anyone who's good with buffs?
I got somethin' big brewin'\u2014a job that could roll in more dough than a pastry chef on fire! But I gotta keep it cheap to make it worth it. Got any sharp negotiators in your crew?
Dang it! I think I ticked off a succubus. She's been glarin' at me like I stole her last biscuit. I was just tryin' to expand my business! Maybe I accidentally stepped into her turf... Anyhoo, there's no tellin' what she might do next! You know anyone who's good at weakening enemies?
That darn Succubus is still givin' me the stink eye. I reckon she's just bidin' her time to make her move. You got any friends who are good at weakening enemies? Preferably tougher than the ones from before? Then we could give her a taste of her own medicine...
Oh no... That Succubus is back, and she brought her girlfriends along! We're outnumbered, but this might be our golden opportunity to flip the script and send 'em packin' for good. Remember to bring friends who're really, really good at weakening enemies and I'll be forever grateful!

I shall cast judgment upon your soul.
You dare dispute the weighing of your soul!?
The cycle of life and death is neverending.
Now then...
Mhmhm, let us play together...
Don't you want to hold me?
I eat disobedient little children like you!
My belly is nice and warm, you know...
Just let me eat you already!
The challenge... is to prove your strength...
Let's see what you're made of...
Do you wish to behold my power to consume the universe...?
I'm afraid I can show you no mercy...
Come... Let yourself be pulled by the red thread of fate...
You amuse me. Step forward, and I shall fight you with all my might...
I suggest you give up now, unless you are truly prepared...
Do you have a death wish...?
I hope that you will be a worthy opponent...
Let us fight 'til the very end...
None shall enter!
Give me back my head!
Stand down!
Give me your riches.
Foolish mortals.
Won't you die for me?
Whatever...
I'm so cramped in here...
What're you looking at...?
