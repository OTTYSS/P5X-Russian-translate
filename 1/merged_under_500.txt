Ayaka
Ayaka can enhance the effects of her allies' Highlight skills. She's an effective partner for characters with powerful Highlights, since she can boost their damage and instantly activate their Highlight.
Ayaka is feeling more confident and decided to write a new song. She seems to have been inspired by our time together and was able to put her feelings into words and music. I hope she can continue to shine.
Ayaka played her new song for me, which is still a work in progress. The melody conveys gentle, yet intense, emotions that sway the heart...

Ayaka seems to be feeling poorly, and confided her worries in me... The girl we met before was one of her former bandmates from high school, but they went their separate ways...

Ever heard of the\nman-faced dog?
Ever since Kiuchi retired from baseball, Motoha has been neglecting her batting practice. Hoping to pull herself out of her slump, she heads to the batting cages in Yongen-Jaya.
Ever since Kiuchi's arrest, the talk about the calling card and the Phantom Thieves has increased.
Every 3 turns, Kikuri-Hime will activate Bond of Death, randomly KO'ing 1 Phantom Thief.\nIt also uses a random Arbiter's Power on the other Phantom Thieves, preventing them from taking certain actions.\nIf the Phantom Thieves defy the arbitration, they gain 1 Seal of Mortality, and if they gain 2 seals, they are KO'd.\nArbitration - Survival: Healing and Defense skills or Highlights must not be used.\nArbitration - Attack: Attack skills or Highlights must not be used.\nArbitration - Support: Buff and Debuff skills or Highlights must not be used.\nIf all Phantom Thieves obey the arbitration, Kikuri-Hime will revive the KO'd Phantom Thief.
Every Ingredient Counts!
Every Persona and Shadow has its own attribute affinities.
Every shop feels\nshort-staffed now.
Every store\nhas a line.
Everyone is talking about the cute mascot in Shibuya.

For our first taste-testing session, Shiina shows off her excellent bartending skills. As we chat, she tells me how she came to be a bartender. She had come to the bar to drink her sorrows away, but she was so amazed by the owner's bartending skills that she wanted to share that amazement with other people. She felt embarrassed talking about it, but it truly is a wonderful dream.

Haruna gave me a puzzle and asked me to deliver it to Shota. Shota and I explored the city solving all of Haruna's puzzles until we reached the end.
Haruna is a Strategist who excels at strengthening her allies' attacks. She can spend Childish Heart to raise allies' Attack and Damage Dealt, making her effective when paired with allies who have multi-hit attacks.
Haruna Nishimori has been offered early acceptance to a university in the US, and as a token of her gratitude for the puzzle rally, she sent me a riddle.

Having decided to participate in the flair bartending contest, Shiina starts practicing her drink-mixing. The contest involves making an original cocktail, but she gets a bit carried away and winds up getting herself drunk... But hey, at least she's happy again.
Having hit a brick wall trying to come up with a dish for the contest, Shun heads to Heritage Kitchen to take a break. There, he learns that Pops adjusts his fried rice based on the customer's mood, giving him a new idea for his dish...
Having secured the route to the Treasure, we prepared ourselves for the upcoming battle. The time has come to send our first calling card.
Having successfully changed the corrupt producer's heart, peace has been restored to the concept caf\xe9. Narumi gave us a special ticket to her event as thanks for our support.
He also made a public confession to all the crimes he committed, breaking down into tears as he apologized.
He always talks so\nbig, but he might\nreally be weak.
He came forward?\nHe didn't get\ncaught?
He may stand out on\nour team, but he's\nnot all that.
He only attacks\nwomen. It's\nterrifying...
He threatened to spread bad press about the restaurant if he refused, leaving Masa no choice but to comply.
He told that\nreporter it was\na real pitch...
He was able to give you a valuable hint, and you hurried off with your companions to help Shun.

Heritage Kitchen is hiring part-time help. Maybe I should go over there...
Heritage Kitchen is pretty busy today. I could go help out...
Heritage Kitchen seems understaffed today...
Heritage Kitchen seems unusually busy today...
Heritage Kitchen was closed, and inside, Miyazawa forced the owner, Yamagoshi, to hand over the ownership documents.
Heritage Kitchen was\nreally delicious.

Hey, are you free today?
Hey, got a minute? There's a wicked Black Ooze cloggin' up the path and gettin' around it's been a real chore. That thing's made the road sticker than a syrup-soaked pancake! Know anyone strong enough to scrape that blob of tar out of my sight?
Hey, got a question
Hey, wait up!

Howdy there sweet pea. I have quite the sticky situation on my hands... That Black Ooze is back, and it's bigger than a mule in a mud pit! I'm at a loss. Can you send over a few strong friends to take care of it soon?
Howdy there, I could use your help. This Matador just showed up, wavin' his cape and darin' me to try and get past. What a load of bull... Are any of your friends good at keeping a solid guard up? I could use their help!
However, before he could make his exit, a masked figure appeared and attacked him...
However, before your strength failed completely, you awakened to a power that was slumbering within you: your Persona.
However, he also suggested there may be others besides the Phantom Thieves capable of using the Metaverse Navigator.
However, just as you were about to begin the operation, an unexpected person offered to help.
However, Lufel didn't think she was truly committed to the job, and thought it would be best not to get her involved.
However, Miyazawa refused to accept defeat, and even attempted to call the police on Shun.
However, sensing the danger just in time, Tomoko shielded Motoha and ended up grievously injured instead.
However, the academic coordinator Mr. Yamanashi supported Akashi and criticized the way Ms. Katayama handles her students.
However, when you tried to call out to them, you felt strange and couldn't muster up the energy to do anything.
However, you were able to deliver Yamagoshi's message to Masa. He found the shaver box in the safe, and gave it to Shun.

I accompanied Kotone to a clothing store so we could get some ideas for her competition outfit, and discuss some other important matters. Afterwards, she confessed what "love" means to her...
I am Merope, your concierge. Please remember me from now on.
I arrived at Caf\xe9 Leblanc.\nAs I opened the door, there was a pleasnt ding from a bell.\nThe owner of Leblanc slowly stood up and introduced himself as Sojiro Sakura.
I assume you heard from\nLeo-chan already
I believe in pursuing the perfect flavor. That's how it's always been, and it won't change anytime soon.
i believe in you!
I came across somethin' real curious\u2014it's a rock! But not just any rock, this one's tougher than a brick house. Think folks'd be interested in durable wares made of this stuff? Hmm... maybe we should give it a good testin' first. Got a few friends who could help us out?
I can finally\nrest at ease.

I can't believe\npeople like Miyazawa\nactually exist.
I can't do that.
I can't focus\nat all.
I can't relax...
I can't remember anything\nwe learn at school
I can't remember\nanything... I'm just\ntrapped here...
I can't thank ya enough for all the things you've taught me. I feel like I've grown a whole lot as a small business owner. Now I'm ready to put my skills to the real test. I'm talkin' knowledge, talkin' deals, gettin' in shape\u2014the whole lot. Don't suppose any of those strong pals o' yours could give me a hand?

I could work at the flower shop in Shibuya...
I could've just kept studying back home in China, but my mom and dad thought it'd be better for me to study abroad... I'm still trying to understand why they wanted me to come here, but they must have had their reasons.
I don't care\nanymore...
I don't even have an\nappetite anymore...
I don't feel like\ndoing much lately...
I don't have any money.
I don't need either of them.
I don't need to sell anything.
I don't really like\nthat new teacher...
I don't recall
I don't trust food\ncritics. Not\nafter Miyazawa.
I don't want to do\nanything. It's all\nso boring...
I don't want to say...
I don't want\nto go home...
I dropped\nmy wallet...
I eat disobedient little children like you!
I enjoyed hearing everyone talk about what they'd do if they were rich... I hope their dreams come true.
I feel exhausted\nevery day...
I feel like reading has helped\nsharpen my mind...
I feel like reading has helped\nsharpen my mind...

I found a new shop.
I got a little favor to ask... Well, I was hopin' to strike up some business with some Shadows, but I gotta say\u2014I'm as nervous as a cow goin' downstairs. You reckon you could ask your friends to help mediate?
I got a message from Yui. Should I log in to the game and see her...?
i got a ticket!!!
I got it!\nLet's get\nsushi today!
I got somethin' big brewin'\u2014a job that could roll in more dough than a pastry chef on fire! But I gotta keep it cheap to make it worth it. Got any sharp negotiators in your crew?
I Got This
I guess the police\ncan do their job\nafter all.
I had a chance encounter with Masaki Ashiya, a senior from Kokatsu Academy, at the flower shop. He seems very kind, and a bit more sociable than I expected...
I had this strange dream where I met an old man called Igor and a woman called Merope... But was it really just a dream...?
I happened to meet a vivacious older lady in Shinjuku, and she helped me out when I was getting harassed by some drunk guy...
I happened to run into my neighbor, Kayo Tomiyama, who's friends with my mom. She... certainly likes to talk...
I have a new video game to play...
I have a proposal...
I have a shield...
I have a sword and shield...
I have a sword...
I have zero\nappetite... Maybe\nit's stress.
I haven't seen that\nhalf-Japanese\ngirl today.
I haven't thought\nabout the future\nat all...
I hear humans are wild for them "bargain sales." Oh, but if I were to do somethin' like that, I'd be busier than a squirrel in a nut factory tryin' to handle all them crowds! Say now, I could do with a power up, and my customers could do with a major power down, if you catch my drift!
I hear\nVictory Kitchen\nis pretty good.
I heard a student\ngot injured\nrecently...
I heard he hangs\naround the station.
I heard he only\ntargets women.\nHow disgusting.
I heard he was\ncaught right here.
I heard that shop is\ncollaborating with a\ngourmet critic.
I heard the Subway\nSlammer's just some\noffice worker.
I heard the train\nstopped. What\nhappened...?
I heard the\nconvenience store\nis hiring.
I heard them Mandrakes can be used to whip up some sorta cure-all potion. Trouble is, every time I try to get near one, they skedaddle faster than a jackrabbit while screamin' bloody murder! Don't suppose you know someone who knows a lot about medicine and got the patience to deal with 'em?
I heard there was\nan owl here during\nthe day!
I heard there's a new movie playing at the theater.
I heard there's\na kid with a pet owl\naround here.
I heard\nthat food critic\napologized.
I hope he spends the\nrest of his life\nbehind bars.
I hope I\nget scouted...
i hope so too
I hope that girl\nis all right...
I hope that you will be a worthy opponent...
I hope these days\nwill never end.
I keep having the same dream. What could it mean?
I knew you could do it!\u2606Better than I even imagined!\u2606
I know someone.
I know!
I made a promise to meet Yui's "friend" in person.
I managed to be more welcoming\nthan I typically am...
I may be an adult in terms of age, but I'm still young at heart, as they say! But the youth culture of today is totally different... Time really does fly.
I may have been drinking too much lately...
I may have done something\nI can't undo...
I mean, he's a talking owl... Of course I was surprised. But I see him as a fellow phantom thief now. Guess he can be a bit uppity at times, though.
I met a girl named Minami who was looking after some kids in the neighborhood. She seemed to have her hands full, so I offered to lend her a hand.
I met a girl performing a puppet show in Shinjuku. When the police were talking to her, she seemed to be deliberately hiding her identity...
I met a strange man dressed as a doctor at the arcade in Shibuya. He seems to be pretty good at shooting games, and I think he might be able to help me hone my own gaming skills...
I met an exchange student from China called Yaoling, who was having some difficulties with buying veggies at the supermarket
I met Shiina by total coincidence... If she hadn't splashed me with water, I never would have set foot in her bar or found out that minors could even go in. Her bartending skills are impressive, and she tells me that she's looking for a mocktail taste-tester, so I take her up on her offer.
I might go try out a new coffee blend at the caf\xe9 in Kichijoji...
I miss that izakaya.
I miss those\ngarlic-filled\ndumplings.
I MISSED IT, SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
I need to fill out my career questionnaire, but I have no clue what to write...
I need to get back in shape for running around in the Metaverse. But I worked pretty hard today, so I can have just one cr\xeape, right? That's fine, right?
I never thought I'd be a phantom thief. If Pops knew, he'd flip.
I really want to\npull a rare figure.
I saw a great new\nanime. You should\ncheck it out!
I saw Noge-san earlier.\nI hope she's doing\nokay now.
I saw when he was\ncaught. He was just\na normal guy.
I saw you...
I see a young girl\nwith a donation box\nhere sometimes.
I shall cast judgment upon your soul.
I should clean my room...
I should clean, but\nI get tired just\nthinking of it.
I should get in shape at the gym...
I should go listen to Ayaka's new song...
I should go try the new specialty drinks at the Jazz Club in Kichijoji...
I should hear what Anderson has to say...
I should hear what Shichi-kun has to say...
I should see if I can help out with anything at Heritage Kitchen today...
I stumbled on somethin' odd by the roadside the other day. Looked like a little piece of desire, or maybe a fragment of someone's consciousness\u2014I can't say for sure. But it felt like it might be connected to one of your friends. I'll let ya know where it was, in case you wanna go look.
I suggest you give up now, unless you are truly prepared...
I think about it once in a while. If I'd never met you... I definitely wouldn't enjoy dancing anymore, let alone flair bartending... Because of you, I've been having a lot of fun lately. So, thanks.
I think I'll have my\nboyfriend come\npick me up.
I told Kotone her performance was beautiful, but she doesn't seem satisfied with that answer. Was there something more she wanted to hear?
I used to be a catcher. Huh? I don't look like one?
I wanna go home\nand play games.
I wanna go lie\ndown somewhere...
I want a new pair\nof sneakers...
I want Chinese\nfood today.
I want dumplings...
I want that case!
I want the blue capsule.
I want the red capsule.
I want the white capsule.
I want to be\na gourmet critic too.
I want to do some cleaning, but there's an unusual visitor in the garden...
I want to eat fine\ncuisine from all\nover the world.
I want to eat\nsomething delicious.
I want to get a huge plot of land, grow lots of tasty things, and eat until I'm full to burst!
I want to keep on singing. For my friends, who showed me how much fun it could be, and for all the people who love my songs. And... for you, too.
I want to pet the\npigeons, but they\nalways fly away.
I want to stop at\nthe drugstore on the\nway home.
I want to\ngo on a trip.
I was able to change the hearts of Miyu's parents, and the Street Artist Festival went on as planned. No longer feeling like she was lost and adrift, Miyu decided to stop using her stage name "Jellie" and will perform with her real name now. She thanked me for helping her stand on her own two feet.
I was able to provide service\nwith a smile...
I was in a dance club back in college, and we did all sorts of dances. I think that's really helped me with my flair bartending. It's kinda like... a step only I can take.
i was pleasantly surprised by this
I went shopping with Yui's friend Musubi Matsukata. With a love for gardening, she picks up a potted basil plant.
I went to cheer on\nmy old team
I went to eat burgers with Yui's friend, and learned about her life.
I went to one of\nthose! Can't believe\nwhat he did.
I went to the batting cages with Motoha, but she wasn't able to swing like she used to...
I went with Merope to Akihabara, where she met her new favorite idol, Narumi Nashimoto.
I will carve my own path...
I wish I\nhad a cat...
I wish to ride a\nFerris wheel
I wish you a\nhappy birthday
I won't make it in\ntime... But taxis are\nexpensive...
I wonder how long\nhis sentence is\ngonna be.
I wonder how\nKiuchi-sama's\ndoing...
I wonder if I\ncan still get\nyakisoba bread.
I wonder if Noge-san\nis okay...
I wonder if someone\ncould cover my\nshift...
I wonder if there's\na perfect place for\na date...
I wonder if they'll\ncatch the Subway\nSlammer soon.
I wonder if\nMagatsukami knows\nwho he is.
I wonder when I'll\nbe able to take\na break...
I wonder which books\nare popular lately.
I worked a part-time job with Ashiya-senpai, and saw his keen skills of observation. Even when dealing with complaints, he has an unshakeable resolve...
I wouldn't mind\nstaying home and\ndoing nothing.
I'd better do some thorough cleaning...
I'd better keep up with my training at the gym...
I'd go with steak.
I'd like to say a big thank-you for always coming 'round and supportin' my business. I've been rackin' my brain tryin' to figure out how to return the favor, but I just don't know where to start. You reckon any of your friends could give me a few pointers on how to support you?
I'll help out.
I'll let it all go.
I'll never forget the feeling of leaping across the stage, the way my costume sparkled under the spotlight... It was just so much fun! ...I wish that fun could've lasted forever.
I'll stop at the\nconvenience store\non my way home.
I'll take a Point Card.
I'll take it.
I'll take the card.
I'll Teach You
I'm a super dedicated worker!
I'm afraid I can show you no mercy...
I'm busy now.
I'm drinking\ntonight!
I'm exhausted.\nThink I'll go to the\nbathhouse.
I'm feeling confident about my singing. I could go to Kichijoji and try for a high score at karaoke...
I'm feeling good today. I might go play at the arcade in Shibuya...
I'm feeling good today.\nMaybe I'll just stay home and play games...
I'm gonna sing\nuntil dawn!
I'm headed to the beach with my friends! We're going to enjoy this trip to the fullest.
I'm hungry.\nLet's go eat.
I'm in a\ngood mood today...
I'm Motoha Arai. My codename is Closer. Nice to meet you again!
i'm not asking if they'd win, idiot
I'm not telling
I'm pretty good at cooking!
I'm really not\nfeeling it right\nnow...
I'm sleepy. Maybe a\nnap will make me\nfeel better.
I'm so cramped in here...
I'm so sick of the\nsame old routine...
I'm still not great at Japanese... I'm always making tons of mistakes. Just be patient with me, okay? Xi\xe8xi\xe8!
I'm tired. I feel\nsleep-deprived\nevery day.
I'm Tomoko Noge. Nice to meet you.
I'm too scared\nto go out into\nthe city now...
I'm too scared\nto walk alone.
I'm working every\nday and have no\ntime for myself.
I'M YOUR #1 FAN
I'm Yumi Shiina. I work as a bartender in Shibuya, and my specialty is flair bartending! Nice to meet you.
I've been hearin' folks talk 'bout these things called Attributes lately... Fire, Ice, Wind, Electricity\u2014stuff like that. Reckon understandin' them might help me whip up some better goods. Could you introduce me to anyone who knows a lot about this stuff?
I've been mullin' over the idea of startin' a new store 'round here... But that Jack Frost's got the roads slipperier than a snake in a bucket of oil. If you know anyone who's got a knack for skatin', send 'em my way, would ya?
I've been so busy\nlately, I haven't\nhad a break...
I've been so childish...
I've been taking it easy, so...
i've been there!
I've been thinkin' of openin' a new trade route for my li'l shop. Trouble is, it's riddled with thorns and that ain't safe. Well, 'specially not for someone like me who likes wearin' sandals. Know anyone who can rescue me from this predicament?
I've been thinkin' of sprucin' up my shop lineup with some quirky goodies! How weird, you ask? Well, I've got this rock that can store electricity. Only problem is, it ain't worth much if I don't have a way to charge it. You know someone who can give it a good zap?
I've been to all the\nshops around here...
I've been tryin' to get some new trade routes up and runnin', but them Shadows done blocked the way. It's a real pain for business, lemme tell ya. I hear they'll let ya through if you can outmuscle 'em, but I ain't up for that kinda thing. Say, any of them pals of yours any good at taking out single enemies?
I've been waiting\nfor a while now...\nWhere are you?
I've given this great thought.
I've got a delivery that's hotter than a skillet on a summer day! Problem is, it's gotta stay that way. You know anyone who could help me keep it nice 'n' warm?
I've got a flower pot.
I've got my eye on a new trade route for business, but the area's full of aggressive Shadows that keep ambushin' folks. You reckon you know anybody who's good at defense? Perhaps they could lend me a hand?
I've got nothing.
I've got something.
I've got to go to biology class...
I've got to go to classic lit class...
I've got to go to English class...
I've got to go to history class...
I've got to go to math class...
I've got to go to social studies class...
I've gotten used to him and all, but I still don't really understand where Lufel came from. Why would the Metaverse have owls?
I've made up my mind\u2014I'm takin' a trip to learn some new tools of the trade. But I hear it's more dangerous than a hog in a smokehouse out there! If you could lemme borrow a few of your friends, including someone who can keep us healed up, I'd sure feel a whole lot better 'bout this journey.
I've never run into\nhim, but I'm glad he\nwas arrested.
I've only seen stuff\nabout the Subway\nSlammer online.

It turns out Chizuko's granddaughter is the girl I saw jump off a rooftop... She's concerned about how to help her granddaughter recover after the incident.
It turns out that Take was forced by his mean friends from the other day to prank Kurotani. Kurotani tries to convince Take to cut ties with them, but he refuses to listen.
It was a pleasant surprise to discover another Persona-user besides us. Although her somewhat loud personality may not be a perfect fit for our covert operations, she is certainly a valuable asset in battle.
It was Yaoling's parents that encouraged her to study abroad, but she's still unsure as to what she should be getting out of it. So in order to understand the purpose of her exchange, she hopes to experience as much as she can while she's here.

Kitazato
Kitazato explained his reasoning to me. He has noticed that many of his patients seem to be losing their desire to live, and to test out his hypothesis, he has been observing the reactions of his opponents in the shooting game. He seems to detect something special in me...
Kitazato may have impressive medical knowledge, but his social skills seem a bit lacking... Despite the efforts of his doting older sister, he's never learned how to interact with women...
Kitazato told the patient about his past and his reasons for becoming a doctor. He once had a young patient who, despite their strong will to survive, unfortunately passed away. The patient was moved by Kitazato's desire to save lives while there is still hope...
Kitazato unexpectedly told me he was cancelling his experiment. When I pressed him for more info, he said that one of his patients had chosen to opt out of surgery, despite the potential for a cure. The patient's decision shocked him...

Miyazawa's channel\nis gonna bite\nthe dust now!
Miyazawa's desires had been distorted from his failure to become the true professional he always aspired to be. Left dejected from his defeat, Miyazawa is approached by Shun...

Miyu got into some trouble during a performance in Shinjuku, but I called the police and they chased the troublemakers off. Miyu expressed her gratitude, and promised she will tell me more when the opportunity arises.
Miyu has moved her performances to Kichijoji now. I met with her at a restaurant, where she told me about her dream of becoming a puppeteer, and her conflict with her parents...
Miyu invited me to visit all kinds of different places with her. At the aquarium, she opened up about her insecurities, and said very earnestly that I've helped her find new strength. How should I respond...?
Miyu is an Elucidator who specializes in strengthening the allies' defense. She can provide shields and increased Defense to her allies, protecting them from powerful enemy attacks.
Miyu Sahara
Miyu started her performance in Kichijoji once again, but the mysterious man in black tried to get in the way once again. She thinks she may have an idea who he is...

Motoha and I decided to hit the gym. Working out with the dumbbells was tougher than I thought.
Motoha and I returned to the batting cages, but she still hasn't reached her former glory. There, we met Tamayo Yoshida, who considers Motoha her rival.

Motoha cut-in that displays\nduring an All-Out Attack.
Motoha cut-in that\ndisplays during battle.
Motoha has become all the more determined to work hard as part of the Phantom Thieves, for the sake of her and everybody's future.
Motoha is capable of attacking all enemies with multiple hits. Try teaming up with a Phantom Thief like Sumi, who receives benefits the more times his allies hit.
Motoha is really popular. She's earnest, kind, and great at sports... though she can be a little lax at times. I'm proud to call her my best friend!
Motoha pleaded with the police to do something about Kiuchi, but with their desires stolen from them, they had no motivation to help.
Motoha realized just how fixated she had been on competing with Tamayo. Having remembered her original reason to stay in shape, the weight is lifted off her shoulders.
Motoha starts an intense training regimen at the batting cages to prepare for her match with Tamayo. She strives to not stop training until she gets the results she needs to win.

Motoha was glad to hear that you wanted to continue your Phantom Thief activities, and hopes to continue working together.

My luck's no good\nlately. Maybe I'll\ngo to a shrine.
My memory is currently incomplete. I understand the way to regain it is to steal the distorted desires, otherwise known as Treasure, from Palace rulers.

My upper body strength...? It wouldn't be difficult to demonstrate, but I'll leave it to your imagination.
My vocal cords feel strong today. It might be a good time to go to Kichijoji to sing karaoke...

Now that I'm expandin' my business, I need to get out there and start new ventures... But land sakes, all the good spots are far off, and I'm feelin' a bit uneasy about goin' it alone. I'd sure appreciate havin' some company so I stay safe while I handle my goods. Got any pals who'd make good bodyguards?
Now that Kaneshiro recognized Makoto as a customer of his bank, the Phantom Thieves realized this might be their ticket into his Palace, and brought Makoto along with them to the Metaverse.
Now then...
Now, I don't mean to fuss, but a Shiisaa's been out on the road practicin' their lion dance like they're tryin' to summon a rainstorm. Gotta say, it's mighty impressive, but they've gone and blocked the whole dang road! Perhaps if someone joined in, they'd move along. Know anyone with fancy footwork like that?

Oh dearie me... A couple of Matadors are tauntin' each other. What's a poor li'l business owner to do? If only some kind souls with a knack for defendin' others were to step in... Hint, hint.
Oh dearie. My poor little shoulders've been feelin' stiff as a fence post lately. But I can't just up and leave the shop unattended, now can I? Say, maybe you could lend me a hand? If you have any friends that can help support me, why I'd be happier than a pig in the sunshine!

Oh no! I'm gonna be\nlate for my date!
Oh no... That Succubus is back, and she brought her girlfriends along! We're outnumbered, but this might be our golden opportunity to flip the script and send 'em packin' for good. Remember to bring friends who're really, really good at weakening enemies and I'll be forever grateful!

Ren Amamiya's Skills
Ren cut-in that displays\nduring an All-Out Attack.
Ren cut-in that\ndisplays during battle.
Ren is able to get Extra Actions, allowing him to perform multiple actions and make it easier for Riko to activate her skills. Additionally, Riko's ability to lower enemy defense helps Ren deal more damage, making them an effective team.
Ren Transformation Tile
Ren's primary strategy relies on gaining Extra Actions and performing more actions, but with the more attacks he uses, the more SP he spends. Morgana has the ability to reduce SP costs for allies, so by having them in the same party, you can reduce the burden on Ren.

Riko
Riko Awakening Battle
Riko comes to the Palace with us, and Lufel recognizes her potential as a Phantom Thief.
Riko confesses her dream of becoming a teacher to her father. To her surprise, rather than firmly oppose her desire, he hands her a memory stick that belonged to her mother.
Riko proposed a strategy that would not require anyone to be sacrificed, but there seemed to be a flaw in the plan...
Riko realizes that there was never any pressure for her to meet others' expectations. Rather than rush her decision to become a teacher or the successor of Umetane, she chooses to take her time and walk her own path.
Riko said she could help lay a trap for Akashi, but just needs a little time to get things ready.
Riko seemed to be constantly busy during the ride, but you also got the feeling that she has a good relationship with Motoha.
Riko speaks of a past incident related to the conversation she overheard at Chinatown, revealing why she felt her only purpose was to meet the expectations of those around her.
Riko specializes in enhancing the party's 1 More and All-Out Attacks. In addition, she can lower the Defense of enemies when they are knocked down, allowing for even more powerful 1 More and All-Out Attacks.
Riko Tanemura
Riko Tanemura: Parlor
Riko tells us about Ms. Katayama's strange behavior, and it seems that Akashi is somehow behind it all. We're going to work together to get to the bottom of this.
Riko tracks down where the former secretary currently works, and goes to meet her. It's a hospital with ties to Umetane. There, Riko meets the director of the hospital, who she knew when she was younger.
Riko was able to open up about her true feelings to Ms. Katayama, which seemed to spur her on...
Riko's Parlor
Riko's plan went perfectly, and you were able to get the password from Akashi's PC with no problems.
Riko-senpai contacted me
Riko-senpai faces her true self, and the winds of fate begin to blow...
Riko-senpai formally introduced everyone to Kei Akashi, the new teacher. He gave a good first impression, but Ms. Katayama seems to hold a different opinion of him...

Sakai chooses to debut her new song in Shibuya, the place that marks her starting point and was where we first met. I accompany her with my specialty, the bass. This is a performance for her and me, and will be a lasting memory for the both of us.
Sakai seems to be down. Wondering if something happened, I ask her what's wrong, and with a sad look in her eyes, she proceeds to explain. She says the friend from high school who invited her to join the band told her, "You were definitely meant to be a musician, Ayaka. More than I ever was." Hearing that her friend has completely given up on the path of music has left Sakai feeling confused...
Sakai's singing voice is very pleasant, with a pure tone that moves those who listen to it. She plays a song she made with her band in high school, which remains a cherished memory for her. I think about what I can do to help her find the courage to sing in public... and come up with a few ideas.

Shun and I tried a secret menu item at a monjayaki restaurant. The taste was greater than he imagined...
Shun and I tried what appeared to be ordinary curry ramen at first glance, but led to him reminiscing about his childhood.
Shun comes up with the ramenburger for the gourmet competition. Well, it certainly is innovative...
Shun creates a ramen that can be enjoyed by one and all. His way of thinking seems to have Serizawa impressed.

Shun cut-in that\ndisplays during battle.
Shun heads to a diner that's running a collab menu with a famous ramen shop. There, he meets prestigious food consultant Takumi Serizawa, who invites him to enter her upcoming contest to create a new ramen dish.
Shun is a Guardian with a varied skillset. He can heal allies, reduce the enemy's defense, and also make enemies focus their attacks on him.
Shun is in high spirits as we visit the familiar Heritage Kitchen. Our orders of fried rice come with a helpful clue.
Shun Kano
Shun Kano
Shun Kano introduced us to the ramen of Heritage Kitchen, and Motoha immediately noticed that it had the taste she remembers. Though it seems that Miyazawa plans to get his hands on this restaurant, as well...
Shun Kano. But around here, you can call me Soy.
Shun presents his carefully perfected ramenburger to Serizawa, but unfortunately it wasn't what she was looking for. Rather than come up with an outlandish idea, she advises him to give an entry that shows what he's learned.
Shun realized he didn't have the shaver box he needed to prepare the ramen. Miyazawa just laughed, and told him he threw it away.
Shun successfully earns a spot in the competition, but in his quest to find the perfect flavor, his journey still continues.
Shun talked to you while you were stretching and asked you about her.
Shun told me of his plans for the future, and asked me to join him on his quest to find his ideal flavor, by touring the local ramen shops.

Thanks for helping\nLeo-chan
Thanks for the other day
Thanks to the fine water quality, this fish is fatter and finer than ordinary crucian carp. It's extremely delicious.
Thanks to the Phantom Thieves' efforts, Kaneshiro's heart was changed and he surrendered himself to the police. But as Sae watched the news on TV, her expression remained stern.
Thanks to your efforts, desire's finally returnin' to this gloomy world. Y'know, I've been seein' fragments of consciousness scattered all 'round Mementos. They might be worth collectin', don't ya think? Might be worth askin' them friends of yours to grab 'em for ya.
Thanks to your efforts, Shun was able to flawlessly recreate the legendary flavor of Victory Kitchen.
That aggravatin' Decarabia showed up again, and this time it's got the hardest quiz I've ever seen. I can't even make heads or tails of it! I'll need your best, most supportive friends to help. The shop can't keep runnin' like this!
That Ame-no-Uzume's got moves that'd make the angels jealous. But I can't help but wonder if she ever gets tired of always dancing by her lonesome. Got any friends who'd be up for joining her?
That bastard Kiuchi.\nI hope he rots in\njail for life.
That bastard should\nhave been caught a\nlong time ago.
That car looks\nexpensive.
That darn Succubus is still givin' me the stink eye. I reckon she's just bidin' her time to make her move. You got any friends who are good at weakening enemies? Preferably tougher than the ones from before? Then we could give her a taste of her own medicine...
That day, even though I did what thought was right...\nI was sued and forced to move to Tokyo...
That day... I was late getting home that night. I witnessed a drunken man aggressively harassing a woman.\nI couldn't just ignore it, so I stepped in to stop him. However\u2014\n"Damn brat... I'll sue!"
That fortune teller\nChihaya in Shinjuku\nis pretty cute.

That night, following Shun's suggestion, the Phantom Thieves met up at Heritage Kitchen.
That ol' bandit Shadow leader just don't know when to quit. He's got himself a bunch of strong bodyguards taggin' along. Things're about to get a li'l dicey 'round here. Sorry to trouble ya again, but I sure could use your help.
That old rubber ball made the Treasure Demon happier than a dog with two tails! But who'd've known that secret entrance led to a baseball stadium!? I must confess, I don't really know anythin' about sports... Could any of your friends show me around?
That pesky Incubus done called in his buddies... He's lookin' mighty hard\u2014uh, hard to beat, I mean\u2014but this might just be your shot, ya hear? Show him you ain't fallin' for his tricks, and he'll skedaddle faster than a scared possum. Know anyone who's good with buffs?
That ramen shop in\nShinjuku is getting\na lot of buzz.
That restaurant was\ngreat! I gotta post\npics online.
That Subway Slammer\nactually injured\nsomeone?
That Subway Slammer\nnever came to\nShinjuku, huh.
That Treasure Demon was happier than a rooster in a henhouse when I showed it that Movie Ticket Stub! Turns out that secret entrance leads to an old Japanese castle of sorts, but lemme tell ya, it's got traps nastier than a snake in the grass. Now it really feels like somethin' out of a movie. If you got any pals who know a thing or two 'bout this place, I'd appreciate their help gettin' around!
that was just ep 2? gg, seriously
That was Noge-san\njust now, right?\nCute as always...
That's definitely a secret!
That's fake, right?\nNo way it looks like\nthe photo.
That's not right.
That's not your only option.
That's seriously\ntraumatizing.
That's Wrong, Isn't It?

The bar owner left an application for a flair bartending contest for Shiina, but she feels conflicted about whether or not to sign up. Shiina takes this opportunity to finally open up about her past.

We are business partners working together as members of the Phantom Thieves. Hoohoo, you know, your bag is quite comfortable by the way.
We came across a lot of damaged and broken robots, and it's probably an accurate reflection of the state of the company's employees in the real world. The realization brings back some painful memories for Noir...
We can't trust\neverything food\ninfluencers say.
We encountered a couple of problem customers at the arcade, and challenged them to a shooting game match. After a hard-won victory, the other patrons were inspired, and found the courage to chase the troublemakers out.
We found a poster inside Miyazawa's palace featuring Shun. It seems that the upcoming Food Fight is all part of Miyazawa's scheme...
We headed to Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku to celebrate our victory over ramen, but Motoha couldn't help but feel there's something different about the taste.
We learned about Akashi's past. Now we leave it to Riko to come up with our next move.
We made it to the underground vault and met up with Joker. All that's left now is to get that Core!
We met a guy named Fox. He's an interesting person, and gets along very well with Shun.
We ran into Mona and Skull again. It feels like no matter where we go, their presence eases the tension.
We reached our sales\nquota for the month!\nLet's celebrate!
We returned to Mementos with Riko, and decided on her new code name.
We saw Akashi's past in the Palace. Despite what happened to him, it does not absolve him of his crimes.
We should stop\ntalking. If someone\noverhears us...
We successfully took the Core, and now it's time to say our goodbyes once more. But I'm sure we'll meet again eventually...
We're All Set!
we're in this with you
We've wound up in a mysterious area again. I wonder if our old friends could be here as well.

Well, ain't that just my luck. Them bandit Shadows are back, and this time, there's a whole swarm of 'em! I can't focus on my deliveries with all this trouble brewin'. Got any strong pals who could put 'em in their places for me?
Well, ain't this a fine mess? Setanta's back, and lookin' meaner than a snake in a thorn bush. Gettin' whooped last time must've bruised his ego. I need you to round up some friends who can give him a good clobberin' so we can put him in his place for good.
Well, ain't this somethin'... Them bandit Shadows are back, and it looks like they've brought a whole lot more trouble with 'em. Could ya round up your strongest friends to deal with 'em?
Well, ain't this somethin'? That Setanta's back again, callin' himself a gatekeeper and blockin' off the whole dang road. And I mean really blockin' it\u2014ain't nobody gettin' through. I'm gonna need a few of your pals to give him a good thumpin' ASAP.
Well, bless my heart, this next delivery's a hike and a half. I'd usually just hoof it, but I'm feelin' mighty low on energy. Know anyone who can give me a ride to the destination?
Well, bless my soul! Business is busier than a bee in a flower patch! I've got a whole mess of little packages that need movin'. Got any friends who can blast the lot of 'em all at once? I reckon they'd make short work of this.
Well, bless my soul! The other day, I was out stretchin' my legs when I tripped over a Koropokguru. My goods went flyin' everywhere like popcorn in a hot skillet! Looks like it'll be a spell before I'm back in business. I'd be awfully grateful if I had someone to help me get back on my feet.
Well, bless my stars! There's a Treasure Demon guardin' a secret entrance. What do ya reckon's hidin' in there? Bet it's somethin' shiny and worth a fortune! I bet we could get them to move if we throw 'em somethin' soft and round... if you catch my drift.
Well, butter my biscuit. I've got a fragile order to deliver but I can't shake the feelin' some sneaky Shadows might come sniffin' while I'm at it. Got any friends who are good at defending and offering support? I could do with some protection.
Well, here we go again... That bandit Shadow boss done showed up, and he's brought along a bunch of tough bodyguards. I reckon they're lookin' to steal my goods. Sorry to trouble ya, but I'd be mighty grateful if you could put an end to this.
Well, here we go again\u2014that darn Decarabia's back with an impossible quiz! I'm gonna need some mighty strong support to get through this one. Let's just cross our fingers this is the last of its nonsense!
Well, I'll be darned! That Decarabia's back at it again with another quiz, and this one's tougher than a rusty nail! I'm gonna need your best, most supportive friends for this... I'm beggin' ya\u2014it's for the good of the business!
Well, I'll be! I've been feelin' sore as a mule lately, and wouldn't ya know it, turns out an Obariyon's been clingin' to my back like a burr on a hound dog this whole time! I'm supposed to be totin' goods, not this critter. I'd be pleased as punch if you introduce me to your friends who can support me!
Well, I'll be! That high-and-mighty Neko Shogun's gone and made off with my merchandise and refuses to return it! Maybe a fellow feline could sweet-talk 'em into doin' the right thing. Know any cats with a silver tongue?
Well, I've been thinkin' 'bout growin' my business lately, but there's this downright creepy Incubus hangin' 'round, givin' me the heebie-jeebies. I just don't have the strength in me to deal with this. Say, could any of your friends give me a power boost?
Well, I... My voice... I'd really like to share my songs. That's my number-one goal.
Well, Russet, you're a pretty mysterious guy, you know? Whenever we're together, I always end up saying too much about myself...
Well, shoot! That Black Ooze is back, and it's bigger and meaner than ever. Now the road's all slicked up with its sticky goo, and I'm stuck. Could you round up those tough friends of yours to take it down?
Well, shoot... the ringleader of them bandit Shadows came struttin' over and threatened to clean me out for good next time. I don't know how much more my little shop can take. I'm gonna need some friends of yours to work security for me in case he comes back.
Well, sugar, business ain't been too hot lately... But I heard folks'll buy just 'bout anything if there's a cute mascot peddlin' it. You reckon people are really that easy to win over? Could you be a dear and find me a cute mascot before I have to file for bankruptcy?

Yaoling
Yaoling and I browsed the stores of Jinbocho, and she found many things that took her fancy.
Yaoling and I happened to see her neighbor, Yukimi Fujikawa, being berated by her mother. Yukimi looked pretty upset...
Yaoling and I headed to the cultural hub of Harajuku. She was amazed by everything there from fashion to food.
Yaoling and I invited Yukimi on a trip to Asakusa to cheer up Yukimi, We all had a great time, and Yukimi said she wanted to return the favor.
Yaoling Awakening Set
Yaoling can lower the Defense of all enemies. She works well with Yusuke, a Sweeper who can attack all enemies at once.
Yaoling cut-in that displays\nduring an All-Out Attack.
Yaoling cut-in that\ndisplays during battle.
Yaoling felt bad about potentially hurting Yukimi's feelings, and planned to invite her out to tea again to make up with her.
Yaoling had long been wondering what was the purpose of her exchange in Japan, but it seems that she finally found her answer.
Yaoling heads to Jinbocho to browse the countless secondhand bookstores that line its streets. Surprised to see so few students there, she wonders if Japanese students also feel a lack of purpose in their studies.
Yaoling introduces Yukimi to a different tea-drinking experience, with a unique combination of teas and snacks. Through it, she conveys the importance of finding what's right for you as opposed to strictly adhering to tradition.
Yaoling is a Saboteur who can lower the enemy's Defense, and increase the whole party's Damage Dealt. She also has powerful attacks herself, and can even inflict Forget on enemies, making her useful in a variety of situations.
Yaoling Li
Yaoling made a difficult request to the staff at Yukimi's favorite restaurant, and struggled to understand Yukimi's perspective.
Yaoling pays a visit to the fashion hotspot of Harajuku. Admiring how the young people express themselves through fashion, she begins to contemplate what her core values are.
Yaoling Transformation Tile
Yaoling wants to make things up to Yukimi somehow. Realizing that she was only causing her more trouble, Yaoling hopes to better explain herself, and invites Yukimi out to another tea party, this time from her own culture.
Yaoling's Skills
Yeah, bars can be pretty intimidating, can't they? A lot of people say they're nervous about coming in. But I'd like it to be a place where people feel welcome anytime! That's why I've been practicing mocktails, you know?
Yeah, I was a pretty big star when I was younger! Even worked as a stylist, you know! And I'm still majorly picky when it comes to fashion.
Yeah. But you know\nwhat he said after?

Yukimi Transformation Tile
Yukimi-san seems like she's really been held back by always following the rules, like she can't express herself... Me, on the other hand, I just do whatever I want... Eh, maybe "I'm free-spirited" sounds better?

Yusuke Kobayashi
Yusuke moved out of the school dorms and, with nowhere else to go, temporarily stayed at Leblanc with the protagonist. The Phantom Thieves decided to throw a party to celebrate Madarame's change of heart...
Yusuke was a pupil of the famous Japanese painter, Ichiryusai Madarame. The Phantom Thieves were conflicted over what to do with the tickets he gave them to Madarame's upcoming exhibition.
