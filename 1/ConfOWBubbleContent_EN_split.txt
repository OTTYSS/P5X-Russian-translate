I'm really not\nfeeling it right\nnow...
This guy... I should\nreport him online as\na Menace.
I wonder if someone\ncould cover my\nshift...
Wonder if there's\nanything new on\nDivine Justice.
That ramen shop in\nShinjuku is getting\na lot of buzz.

What are they\ndoing here?
They don't seem to\nknow anything.
This sucks, man...
What should I do...
Sticking around here\nisn't so bad,\nreally...
What was my name,\nagain?
I can't remember\nanything... I'm just\ntrapped here...
I hope these days\nwill never end.
This sucks. I just\nwanna go home and\nhit the sack.
Ooh, something's\ngoing down on\nDivine Justice.
The caf\xe9 over\nthere is really\ngood...
The doctor at that\nclinic is real\nstrange...
What should I do\nfor dinner?
I really want to\npull a rare figure.
Old movies aren't\nbad. What's showing\nnext month?
Whoa! Someone broke\nthe record at the\nbatting cages?
Think I'll visit\nthe bookstore.
Wonder if there's\nanything good on\nTV tonight.
Booored.
Ugh! Why does\neverything have to\nbe so annoying?
That must've been\nreally tough!
Did you hear that?
Shhh, someone will\nhear you!
Really? Seriously?
I know!
So tired...
There's too many...
Did you read it?\nThe article.
Kiuchi's pitch got\nhit by some kid.\nNo way, right?
He told that\nreporter it was\na real pitch...
Huh? So that was the\nbest he could do?
If it's true, that's\npretty abysmal.
Yeah. But you know\nwhat he said after?
"I didn't really try\nbecause no women\nwere watching"!
Hahaha! Seriously?\nStill, losing to a\nkid? Pathetic!
He always talks so\nbig, but he might\nreally be weak.
He may stand out on\nour team, but he's\nnot all that.
If he does make it\nto majors, he won't\nlast long.
We should stop\ntalking. If someone\noverhears us...
Those guys...\nAre they joking!?
Talking shit behind\nmy back!?
How dare they laugh\nat me... Screw those\nbastards!
Sato-senpai is\ndefinitely our\nMVP, but...
Doesn't he have\nany weaknesses?
Oh right...
Apparently, he once\nheard a loud bang\nand fainted.
Hiih...\nHaah...
I wonder how\nKiuchi-sama's\ndoing...
Kiuchi-sama...\nWhere is he, anyway?
He's the only one\nnot here yet.
I don't feel like\ndoing much lately...
I don't want to do\nanything. It's all\nso boring...
Why do I have to\nfill in this\ndumb form?
I haven't thought\nabout the future\nat all...
I wouldn't mind\nstaying home and\ndoing nothing.
Go into the family\nbusiness, or set off\non my own. Hm...
A lot of students\nare skipping school\nthese days.
I can't focus\nat all.
Why do I have to\nstudy so much?
Class is\ntoo hard.
Seems like everyone\ngoes on Divine\nJustice lately.
What is there to\neven gain from being\na Menace?
I wonder if I\ncan still get\nyakisoba bread.
That was Noge-san\njust now, right?\nCute as always...
There's a scary guy\non the rooftop...
I'm sleepy. Maybe a\nnap will make me\nfeel better.
Afternoon classes\nare such a drag.
I wanna go lie\ndown somewhere...
This weather's\nperfect for a\nlunchtime walk.
Arai-san and\nNoge-san make quite\na pair, huh?
Someone was shoved\nviolently at\nthe station!
I wonder if Noge-san\nis okay...
Who would do\nsuch a thing?\nThat's terrible.
No updates from\nDivine Justice yet.
An accident? I hope\neveryone's okay...
Things feel really\ndangerous lately.
Damn... I had a\nshift today,\ndidn't I?
Maybe I should buy\nsome new clothes.
Ah... I'm tired...
The airsoft shop guy\ndoesn't look like\na civilian...
Looks like a new\nmovie is coming out.
The Subway Slammer\nwas once a pro\nbaseball player?
Takeyuki Kiuchi?\nWho's that?
Were there really\nthis many victims?
That bastard Kiuchi.\nI hope he rots in\njail for life.
Food reviews these\ndays are pretty\nentertaining.
I hear\nVictory Kitchen\nis pretty good.
Ah... I'm craving\nChinese food...
All he did was shove\npeople. How is that\nnewsworthy?
No news from\nDivine Justice...
I saw Noge-san earlier.\nI hope she's doing\nokay now.
When will Heritage\nKitchen reopen?
Do food critics\nreally have that\nmuch influence?
Arai-san's been\nhanging out with\nboys a lot...
The internet's\nso boring lately.
I wanna go home\nand play games.
I heard\nthat food critic\napologized.
Do you think those\nshops that closed\ncan reopen?
There haven't been\nany good anime\nlately...
Heritage Kitchen was\nreally delicious.
I'm tired. I feel\nsleep-deprived\nevery day.
Hey! What are you\nlooking at?
We can't trust\neverything food\ninfluencers say.
Let's go back to\nthat old shop!
Huh? You have\nthat figure!?
What the heck is\nan "educational\nadvisor"?
The new teacher\nseems pretty good.
I don't really like\nthat new teacher...
Where should we go\nafter school today?
I saw a great new\nanime. You should\ncheck it out!
The new teacher? Oh,\nI was distracted by\nRiko-senpai...
Wanna head home\ntogether?
Hey, wait up!
Do you think the\nclass rep is, uh,\nsingle?
The new teacher is\nso hot... Should I\ntalk to him?
Not bad...
It's too crowded.\nI can't shop\nlike this.
This store is\nso last season.
Whoa! Who can afford\nto spend this much\non clothes?
That movie was\npretty good.
Wanna go to karaoke?
I'm hungry.\nLet's go eat.
My muscles are\nkilling me. I've\nbeen slacking.
Is this line just\nfor the fitting\nroom?
The airsoft shop\nover there is\nreal cool.
A lot of people got\nhurt by the Subway\nSlammer, huh?
He's not here,\nis he?
Ouch... It still hurts\nwhere he hit me...
I heard he hangs\naround the station.
That's seriously\ntraumatizing.
Why hasn't he\nbeen arrested?
Uh... This tastes\nstrange. I don't\nlike it.
Isn't there a nicer\nrestaurant nearby?
I wonder which books\nare popular lately.
That guy's\npretty cute.
Can you believe what\nthey sell in vending\nmachines now?
Let's go eat cr\xeapes.
The gym trainer\nseems a bit strange.
I want to stop at\nthe drugstore on the\nway home.
I heard a student\ngot injured\nrecently...
Someone got pushed\non the tracks! Hope\nthey're okay...
When are they going\nto catch him?
I hope that girl\nis all right...
I'm too scared\nto go out into\nthe city now...
He only attacks\nwomen. It's\nterrifying...
I don't even have an\nappetite anymore...
The underground\nmall's got new\nclothes in stock!
Where should I get\na part-time job?
Oh no! I'm going\nto be late for\nmy shift!
I'm exhausted.\nThink I'll go to the\nbathhouse.
There's always\nstudents studying\nat the diner.
The manager of\nthe airsoft shop\nis scary...
How long should\nwe practice today?
Didn't they see him\non the security\ncameras?
The police should\ndo something soon.
I wonder if\nMagatsukami knows\nwho he is.
I've been so busy\nlately, I haven't\nhad a break...
I want to\ngo on a trip.
Why aren't you\nanswering the phone?
My entire body is\ncovered in grilled\nmeat stink.
I can't relax...
They finally caught\nthat guy.
Why would a baseball\nplayer do something\nlike that...?
Yes! They finally\ngot him!
Now I don't have to\nbe so scared to go\nout anymore.
Huh? He turned\nhimself in?
He came forward?\nHe didn't get\ncaught?
I wonder how long\nhis sentence is\ngonna be.
There's a good ramen\nshop in Shinjuku.
Ooh, a fortune\nteller in Shinjuku\nyou say?
The ramen at\nVictory Kitchen\nis really good.
That gourmet food\ncritic is popular\nthese days.
No new stores are\nopening lately...
That bastard should\nhave been caught a\nlong time ago.
It's nice to be able\nto go about the city\nwithout fear.
I hope he spends the\nrest of his life\nbehind bars.
This place is\ndelicious! Why's the\nrating so bad?
Wait, is that\ncritic just making\nstuff up?
Take online reviews\nwith a massive pinch\nof salt.
Let's go eat at\nthat new shop.
These reviews are\nglowing... Were they\npaid off?
Wow, it looks really\ndelicious in\nthe photo.
I heard that shop is\ncollaborating with a\ngourmet critic.
These two review\nscores are totally\ndifferent...
Let's go get\nsomething to drink.
Who would want to go\nup against a gourmet\nfood critic?
Haha, that pose!\nIs he trying to look\nlike a samurai?
A Food Fight, huh?\nSounds interesting.
Has it really been\nthat long since the\nincident...?
This place has\ngotten a lot of bad\nreviews lately.
This is delicious!\nI've gotta bookmark\nthis place...
So it was Miyazawa's\nfault that store\nshut down!?
Even if you said\nsorry, we don't have\nto forgive you!
Miyazawa's a Menace?\nBut his show was\nso good...
Does anyone actually\nbelieve what food\ncritics say?
Avoid anywhere\nMiyazawa recommends\nlike the plague.
Don't listen to what\nothers say. As long\nas you like it...
I can't believe\npeople like Miyazawa\nactually exist.
A new restaurant's\nopening soon. I\nwanna try it.
The food I cook\nmyself is the\nmost delicious.
I want Chinese\nfood today.
I heard there was\nan owl here during\nthe day!
Finally finished\nwork...
I feel exhausted\nevery day...
Should we grab a\ndrink somewhere?
I'm working every\nday and have no\ntime for myself.
Guess I'm spending\nthe night at an\ninternet caf\xe9.
That girl's amazing\nat guitar.
Why doesn't that\ngirl with the guitar\nsell CDs?
Let's ask Shichi-kun\nif he knows any new\nshops nearby!
Almost home! Snacks\nand a cold beer are\nwaiting for me!
I don't want\nto go home...
I'm so sick of the\nsame old routine...
We reached our sales\nquota for the month!\nLet's celebrate!
I heard there's\na kid with a pet owl\naround here.
It seems unsafe\naround here lately.
I hope I\nget scouted...
Someone got shoved\nhere in broad\ndaylight.
Would anyone really\nslam into people\non purpose?
I heard the Subway\nSlammer's just some\noffice worker.
Why would someone\nslam into people?\nIt's so scary.
Every shop feels\nshort-staffed now.
I see a young girl\nwith a donation box\nhere sometimes.
Shichi-kun's working\nlate every day...
Why isn't the mascot\na cat?
Let's hurry home.\nIt's been dangerous\nhere lately.
This is the time we\nagreed on. Where\nare they?
It's our first time\nmeeting. Hmm, what\nare they like?
That Subway Slammer\nactually injured\nsomeone?
Aren't there any\npolice officers at\nthe station?
I dropped\nmy wallet...
I heard the train\nstopped. What\nhappened...?
The world is getting\nmore dangerous\nevery day.
That girl who was\npushed on the tracks\nis in hospital.
I wonder if they'll\ncatch the Subway\nSlammer soon.
I think I'll have my\nboyfriend come\npick me up.
I'm too scared\nto walk alone.
I heard he only\ntargets women.\nHow disgusting.
It's not even in the\nnews, and there's no\ninfo online...
If I meet him, I'll\nmake sure he\nregrets it.
Let's go to the\nunderground mall\nat the station.
The underground mall\nmight have a good\ngift for her...
Let's go buy\nsome flowers.
I want a new pair\nof sneakers...
Let's just eat\nsomething.
I heard the\nconvenience store\nis hiring.
I got it!\nLet's get\nsushi today!
I want dumplings...
I should clean, but\nI get tired just\nthinking of it.
The new release is\nout! I'm staying\nup all night!
Has that girl gotten\neven better?
Why hasn't she\nbeen scouted?
Does anyone even use\nphone booths\nthese days?
When will I ever\nwin first prize?
I want to pet the\npigeons, but they\nalways fly away.
There's a really\ncute chubby cat\nin Zoshigaya.
I wish I\nhad a cat...
I haven't seen that\nhalf-Japanese\ngirl today.
Man, school was fun.\nAside from tests and\nbeing broke...
Come on, I gotta win\nsomeday... This is\nso frustrating!
I heard he was\ncaught right here.
I saw when he was\ncaught. He was just\na normal guy.
Didn't the people\nwho got shoved\nreport it?
Let's just go to a\nplace with\nsolid reviews
I can finally\nrest at ease.
I guess the police\ncan do their job\nafter all.
It took them way too\nlong to catch him.
Did you hear? The\nguy who slammed into\nyou was caught.
Did that really\nwarrant a special\nnews report?
What was the name of\nMiyazawa's channel\nagain?
This place seems to\nhave good ratings.\nLet's eat here.
How'd they get such\ngood reviews? The\nservice stinks.
Wasn't that gourmet\nreview show on\ntoday?
That's fake, right?\nNo way it looks like\nthe photo.
Nothing beats the\nusual go-to!
There are too many\npeople making food\nreview videos.
A one-year wait for\na reservation?\nUnbelievable.
Every store\nhas a line.
Let's just go get\nramen from\nVictory Kitchen.
When will that shop\nin Zoshigaya reopen?
Oh, Miyazawa just\nposted some kind of\nannouncement.
I want to eat fine\ncuisine from all\nover the world.
Diet first... Then I'm\ngonna go all out\nat a buffet!
I want to be\na gourmet critic too.
Nothing beats a\nhearty home-cooked\nmeal.
Let's go to\nShinjuku.
Maybe I'm cursed...\nShould I get my\nfortune told?
That fortune teller\nChihaya in Shinjuku\nis pretty cute.
I have zero\nappetite... Maybe\nit's stress.
I wonder when I'll\nbe able to take\na break...
There's been so many\nnew shops opening\nhere lately.
Online shopping is\nso convenient.
If I had a boyfriend,\nhe would carry my\nbags for me...
These clothes\nare so cute!
Miyazawa's channel\nis gonna bite\nthe dust now!
Without Miyazawa's\nreviews, I dunno\nwhat to eat...
As awful as Miyazawa\nwas, food reviews do\ncome in handy.
That restaurant was\ngreat! I gotta post\npics online.
I want to eat\nsomething delicious.
I've been waiting\nfor a while now...\nWhere are you?
What should I eat?
I've been to all the\nshops around here...
Chinese food really\nis the best\nafter all.
I'm gonna sing\nuntil dawn!
Let's check out\nthat shop.
Sorry to keep\nyou waiting.
That girl's reading\npeople's fortunes.\nIs she legit?
A fortune teller?\nHmm...
Hey, why are you\nstill not here...
Let's go to\nthe bookstore.
There's a lot of\nfood review streams\nthese days.
I'll stop at the\nconvenience store\non my way home.
It's always crowded\nhere no matter what\ntime you come.
Which shop should\nI go to today?
I'm drinking\ntonight!
Choosing is a\nhassle. Let's just\npick any place.
That Subway Slammer\nnever came to\nShinjuku, huh.
I've never run into\nhim, but I'm glad he\nwas arrested.
I've only seen stuff\nabout the Subway\nSlammer online.
There are some real\nsickos out there.
I'm in a\ngood mood today...
Oh no! I'm gonna be\nlate for my date!
What should\nI get her...?
I won't make it in\ntime... But taxis are\nexpensive...
The Subway Slammer\nhas become quite\na hot topic.
Didn't the victims\nreport it to\nthe police?
I don't care\nanymore...
My luck's no good\nlately. Maybe I'll\ngo to a shrine.
This place has a\nlow rating. Let's go\nsomewhere else.
Takeyuki Kiuchi...\nThe former baseball\npro, right?
Didn't Takeyuki\nKiuchi use to coach\nlittle league?
I went to one of\nthose! Can't believe\nwhat he did.
Why are you\nalways late?
I wonder if there's\na perfect place for\na date...
My heart races every\ntime I see you.
A food fight with a\ngourmet critic?\nSounds boring.
Huh? Seriously?
I found a new shop.
Hurry up and decide\nwhere we're\ngoing already!
Wait a minute...
That's not right.
Nice. I'm gonna\npost this online.
Why haven't you\nbeen texting me\nlately...?
Make sure to take\na good one!
That car looks\nexpensive.
It's a nice shop, so\nwhy are the reviews\nso bad?
Ah, right, right...
Since Miyazawa's\napology, a lot of\ncritics quit...
I don't trust food\ncritics. Not\nafter Miyazawa.
They're still talking\nabout Miyazawa? Who\neven cares?
So Miyazawa screwed\nover that little\nramen place?
Miyazawa ruined\nVictory Kitchen's\nflavor...?
I miss that izakaya.
Honey, I'm here!\nWhere are you?
Today I'll treat\nmyself to a steak.
I miss those\ngarlic-filled\ndumplings.
Ramen... Ramen...
Ahh... Sooo full...
Sorry I'm late!
The shop's too\ncrowded. Where\nshould we go?
Drinks these days\ncome in all sorts of\nweird flavors.
Let's get a drink\nafter we eat!
