I'm sorry, but we're not open yet.
The interior renovations are taking longer\nthan expected...
Please come visit as soon as we're open!
All right, ready for another shift on\nthe register?
It'll probably get hectic, but try to\nkeep it cool.
You're the best. Thanks again!
You're in fine fettle today.
Let's retain that momentum.
Great job! You were in the zone.
You're already an expert at this.
Well, thanks again for today.
Come work another shift when you're\nfree, okay?
You've become a first-rate employee.
Still, do not fall into complacency.
Okay, you're on register again today.
We're having a special sale, so some items\nare discounted.
Instant foods, rain gear, and hot drinks are\n20% off.
All right, good luck out there.
Bravo! What exceptional service.
It's bustling, but I have faith in you.
I'm ready to pay.
Instant ramen, a plastic umbrella, and hot\ncoffee. These are all on sale.
The total is 1,540 yen, so 20% off\nwould be...
Correct.
The register appears to agree.
Your math is off. It should be 1,232 yen.
We have a lot of customers, so please be\nextra careful.
This is no time for japes.
No messing around at work.
Honestly, what's gotten into you?
Phew, the rush is finally over.
Thanks for all your help. You really saved\nmy butt!
More customers means more moola, right?
Anyway, good job!
Today was quite the frenzy.
Regardless, you look proud. Such bedlam\nbegets equal rewards.
Hey! First day on the job, huh?
You must be {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nMind if I call you {NAME1}-kun?
I'm Nanami Shibuya, and I'll be showing you\nthe ropes.
I'd like to have you work the register today,\nbut let's start you off by watching me first.
Hopefully this'll help you get a feel for it.
Of course! Let's hop to it, then.
Great! Let's get started!
Oh, it's worth mentioning we sometimes have\nsale days which attract huge crowds\nof customers.
It's crazy busy, but the extra pay will be\nworth it.
I hope you consider working those shifts.
So, ready to dive in?
Hoo, what impeccable hospitality.
This Shibuya girl is a service maven.
Do try to keep up.
Oof, looks like today's gonna be another\nbusy day...
Sorry to throw you in the deep end.
So, ready to serve with a smile?
Ooh! I'll be counting on you, then!
No worries. We all start somewhere!
We've got this.
You must be exhausted, huh?
Let's end here for today. Good job!
All right. I've got a few things to take care\nof first, so...
Get home safe!
A side job at a convenience store...
Working a customer service job is certainly\none way to spread kindness, no?
This has been an edifying experience.
Thanks for taking another shift!
Okay, you're on register today.
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.
By the way, there's a trick to ringing\nup items.
Like, you can scan items faster if you know\nwhere the barcode is!
Remember that, and you'll have everything\nscanned in no time!
Now, let's see you in action!
Remember, she advised us to memorize the\nlocations of the barcodes.
A Tokyo Food Tour magazine.
Humans can't seem to get enough\nof this Mad Bull canned beverage.
You're in top form.
Superb! Keep at it.
Great job today!
You're already a model employee.
Sorry to spring this on you, but it's time\nfor a pop quiz!
Where is the barcode on the "Tokyo Food\nTour" magazine?
Correct!
Looks like someone's been paying attention!
Nope, sorry.
Pay close attention to where the barcodes are\nas you scan each item.
Sorry to pull rank on you like that.
But this trick will optimize your workflow,\nso keep it in mind.
Oh, your shift is already over. See you\nnext time!
Hoohoo, your efforts have been rewarded.
Our minds are now enriched, as are\nour pockets.
Today, I'd like you to help stock items.
Simply sort them by label.
That's what I like to hear!
It seems organization is your m\xe9tier.
Keep up the fine work.
Great job today. You're a real lifesaver!
You're one fast learner. I think I've taught\nyou all I know!
No, really. That's an honest compliment.
Well, until next time.
Here's to another productive workday.
You're looking rather pleased with yourself.
Thanks for the help!
You're an old hand at this by now.
Great job! No complaints here.
The store is packed today.
Remember, service with a smile!
Of course the line grows the moment Shibuya\ngoes on break...
Still, I'm sure you'll manage.
Nice work! You dealt with that crowd all\nby yourself!
The manager was raving about you in the back.
Expect a nice chunk of change!
Well done! See you next time.
I must say, I'm impressed by your cordiality\namongst the utter chaos...
Your altruistic nature most certainly\nshone through.
Hello. I'm Mebuki Furueda, the owner.
I thought I'd be able to walk you through\neverything today, but...
Truth is, we're short-staffed and don't have\nthat kind of time.
So, think you can learn by example by\nwatching me instead?
Learning through observation alone?\nHoo, goodness. I fear for this establishment...
Yeah, I like your moxie!
Let's get crackin'!
No worries, you'll be fine!
The job isn't that hard... Well, usually.
No path but forward I suppose.
Hmm, that apron suits you.
The owner seems all right too, though her\nwords did rattle me earlier.
She is able to handle her duties efficiently\nwhile keeping an eye on you.
They even have a loyal customer base.\nI'm glad there are no shady affairs afoot.
Great work today. Here, this is what I\nowe you.
You're a fast learner. You'll come work\nagain, right?
By the way, we also hold events sometimes.
The shop is swamped on those days, so I'd\npay you extra.
A tempting proposal. We should return when\nthey're busy.
What's more, aren't flowers a balm for\nthe heart?
Are you the new part-timer?
Let's skip the introductions. I need you to\nstart right away.
Any questions?
Take customers' orders, prep them,\nserve them, ring them up, and then\nclean the store.
The meals are all ready-made, so\nit should be simple. Just make sure\nyou're nice to the customers, okay?
And that's it. You'll be fine, kid.
Okay, I need to check the other stores!
Better go now, or I won't make it in time...
Well, I'm counting on you.
What nerve. How dare he abruptly leave you\nalone to figure things out.
Well, do the best you can. I'm right here\nwith you.
Ah, that customer is ready to pay.
And this one appears to want to order.
Business is relatively slow today, so let's\nease into this.
Good to see you.
Not bad for your first day. It's closing\ntime, so you can leave now.
Although far from glamorous, this isn't a bad\nplace to work.
It might be wise to work another shift if\nthe opportunity arises.
Oh, you decided to come!
I was all over the map the other day, so I\nthought I might've put you off...
You did amazing last time, so today I'd like\nyou to pick out flowers.
Don't worry, I'm going to show you how\nit's done.
Ahh... real floral responsibilities at last.
Sorry to put you on the spot, but here's a\nflower question for you.
If a customer asks for bold flowers that\nconvey love, what would you pick out\nfor them?
Red roses are the embodiment of love\nand boldness.
Aaand... Bzzt, wrong!
That wouldn't completely satisfy the\ncustomer's request.
They asked for something to express both\nlove and boldness.
The lily of the valley can convey love, but\nis too demure.
And although big and bold, dahlias signify\ncongratulations and gratitude.
Roses are dazzling, and red ones symbolize\na confession or affectionate gesture.
That's why they're an ideal way to\nexpress love.
I think that's enough on flower language\nfor now.
I'm sure this knowledge will come in handy\nwhen a customer comes asking for help!
If there's anything you're uncertain about,\nyou can always reach out to me.
So, ready for a final review? An order just\ncame in.
They want something modest to convey their\nlove. What flower do you suggest?
Hoo, a small flower might fit the bill\nquite nicely.
Perhaps something the manager told us\nbefore may provide a clue. Do you\nhave any suggestions?
Based on what she mentioned earlier, I'm not\nconvinced that is the right choice.
A smaller flower size seems to be the most\nappropriate for the customer's requirements.
Hmm, I'd say this one seems to fit\nthe criteria.
Hopefully the customer will like them too.
Hmm. I'm not sure roses are the best choice\nin this case.
No worries. I'll pick one out, so\nwatch closely.
The customer was thrilled!
You're really getting the hang of this.\nI think you're ready to take more on.
At any rate, here's your pay.
Make sure to keep up with your\nflower studies.
I admit I've got a lot to learn too.
If you have any questions, just say the word!
Knowledge is indeed an endless pursuit.
Well, good work today!
Come back anytime.
It seems the owner still has work to do.
Now then, it's time we head home.
Hi there! Thanks for helping out! I've got my\nhands full right now.
Today, I'd like you to focus on sales.
I'll handle the custom orders!
Why, you're already a service expert.
You look dashing with flowers in hand.
Great job as always! Here's your pay.
You really are a lifesaver.
Come back whenever you're free!
Hoo, what a rewarding shift.
Your tranquil expression amongst the flowers\ncreated a picturesque image of serenity.\nNow then, let's head home.
Hoo, we're up to our ears today.
And a high volume of customers means lots\nof orders.
Focus and try to keep track of them all.
One large twice-cooked pork bowl, please.
I'd like a large yakiniku bowl.
One medium beef bowl, please.
I'll have the large beef bowl!
The orders keep coming...
Still, we mustn't panic. Stay calm and\nmemorize each one.
Do you remember what the first\ncustomer ordered?
Yes, a large twice-cooked pork bowl.
No, that's not it. Think carefully now.
What about the second customer?
Yes. Nicely remembered.
And what did the third customer ask for?
Finally, what was the fourth order?
Yes, that's what they asked for.
That's all the orders. Now we only need to\nmake and serve them.
Hoo, what an eventful day.
I'm sure you will be duly compensated\nfor your efforts.
Let's collect your pay and go home.
Great job the other day! You were\nreally hustling.
Well, keep up the good work!
Looks like we're on our own again.
But this time, experience will guide us.
Indeed, you are now quite adept at this.
I can watch over you with ease.
Ah, a new order. Hurry, but don't rush!
You were splendid today.
It's time to receive your pay and go home.
Thanks for coming!
We're doing an event today, so it's all\nhands on deck!
We're going to be swamped, so expect lots of\norders coming your way!
In return, I'll make sure to compensate you\nwell for your troubles.
Let's give it our all!
Ah, we've already got a bouquet order.
They'd like pink flowers for a celebration.\nI'll leave this one to you!
The request is for pink flowers to honor\nan occasion.
Remember, think pink. Take your time and\ntry again.
Hoohoo! An excellent choice.
Pink carnations represent gratitude. An apt\nflower for any celebration.
What a lovely bouquet! But we've still got\nmore orders!
The next request wants large flowers with a\nmild scent.
We need big yet faintly-scented flowers.\nLet's think this over.
Indeed, that is our best option. You've\nbecome quite the florist.
Thank you so much! Our customers were over\nthe moon.
Looks like all your training has paid off.
I'm glad you're interested in flowers.
You're certainly more versed in flora\ncompared to the first day.
You handled today's event like a champ and\nreally came through for me.
As promised, enjoy your big payday!
Drop by anytime.
Hoo, what a productive day.
Today was particularly gratifying. You must\nbe exhausted, so rest well.
Hi! Thanks for lending a hand.
Today, I'd like you to make bouquets.
I sense another flower quiz ahead\ncoming up...
We'll never finish all these orders unless\nwe team up.
First up is a bouquet with big, bright blooms\nto congratulate a friend on the birth of\ntheir baby.
Right, time to pick some flowers. Big, bold\nones to celebrate new life.
Hmm... I have my doubts.
Yes, that will do nicely!
The customer was delighted with the bouquet!
Smiles like that remind me why I became\na florist.
Thanks for today! Here's your payment.
Stop by again when you have time.
You looked remarkably at ease among the\nflowers. Now, let's make our way home.
I'd like you to make some more bouquets.
I've already got a request...
They'd like flashy flowers with a rich aroma.
Right, time to pick some flowers. Something\nvibrant and highly fragrant.
That flower lacks a strong aroma.\nLet's choose another.
Surely that one's too pale? They asked for\nsomething vivid. Let's choose something else.
Yes, this flower's fragrance and bright\nyellow hue are perfect.
Thanks for today! Here's what I owe you.
You looked rather at peace surrounded by all\nthose flowers. Now then, let's go home.
Gone are the days of being a mere fledgling.
You're just as reliable on the register.
But don't let comfort turn to neglect.
Anyhoo, I'd love to try that yakiniku bowl\nsans rice sometime.
Let's get paid and return to our\nhumble abode.
So, we're in the kitchen today.
The food is ready-made, but you must still\npay attention.
Yes, you're doing a stellar job.
You've prepared each order flawlessly.
Now, let's retrieve your pay and then we can\ngo home.
There is quite a crowd today!
Regardless, you must remain focused and\navoid making mistakes.
It is reasonably busy today.
I'm sure this shift will be a breeze for you.
I'd like to get the twice-cooked pork\nset, please.
One large beef bowl, and hurry.
Today's rush left a mountain of dishes. We'd\nbetter wash them.
Let's get paid and return home.
I get to work with you today!
Hehe, it's nice to have someone I know\naround. Especially if it's you...
There sure are a lot of customers today.\nLet's do our best together!
Phew... That was tough, but we managed\nto get through it!
I feel like I can handle anything with\nyou around.
Well, see you! Hope we get a shift together\nagain sometime.
Hey, did you see the kitchen?
Looks like they must've gotten slammed with\ncustomers, and then nobody washed any\nof the dishes...
Things were looking pretty bad back there,\nbut everything turned out okay!
I feel like I always get more done when\nyou're here. I hope we get to work\ntogether again!
Could you maybe help me on the\nregister today?
I'll take care of the other stuff.
I've got nothing to worry about with you\nhere! I know you've always got my back.\nHeehee...
Great work today!
Thanks to you, I could focus on getting all\nof my own work done. Thanks.
It looks like we're short-staffed in the\nkitchen today. Would you mind helping out?
I'll take care of the dining area!
Whew, made it through another day!
Thanks for handling kitchen duty! We didn't\nhave to leave any customers waiting.
Well, see you later.
One rose bouquet, please!
I'm looking for some flowers for a proposal...
Thanks for today! I bet your head's still\nspinning, right?
I'm really grateful for you stepping in on\ndays like this.
Here's your pay.
So... we were super busy yesterday, and now\nour inventory is a mess.
So, I'd like you to tidy up this time.
Thanks, everything looks spotless!
Right, here's your pay. Hope to see you\nagain soon.
I want you to focus on sales this time.
Thanks a bunch. It looks like we're done\nwith all the orders.
Here's today's pay.
Come again soon.
Hey, thanks for coming in today.
Since I'm here today, I'd like you to serve\ncustomers, all right?
We'll keep making them, so you just keep\nselling them.
Sound good? I'll leave it to you, then.
Hoom... Customer service appears to be a\npaltry task for you.
It seems this customer is quite flummoxed by\nthe menu options. Could you offer\nany recommendations?
Oh, the Japanese flavor sounds perfect!\nI'll take one of those, please!
Hmm, I'm not feeling like anything in\nparticular... I'll have whatever's the\nmost popular.
Good work today!
Seems like you handled the customers well.
I hope you'll help out again next time\nwe're busy.
I'm sure you wouldn't mind earning a\nlittle extra?
Well then, take care getting home, okay?
You've become a true master of\ncustomer service.
Shall we return home, then?
Thanks so much for coming in! We're\nabsolutely swamped today.
I'll be taking orders, so you can handle\nbaking.
All you gotta do is cook the batter, add the\nfilling, top with cream, then wrap it up.
The manual's just over there!\nOkay, I'll leave it to you!
That manager seems as lackadaisical as\never... Do you remember the explanation?\nSeems that's all you'll get.
One Strawberry Cream, please!
Hoom, according to the manual,\nfor strawberry cream...
First, bake the batter. Then put in the\nstrawberries, the cream, and wrap it all up\nin the cr\xeape. Then it's finished.
Let us begin with the first step. Do you\nremember what to do?
Next add the filling. What do we put in it?
Next, the ingredients.
Then we add the topping. Which do we pick?
Now, a bit of flavor.
Nice. Time to finish it off. What should we pick?
And the finishing touch...
All that's left is to get it ready to hand\nto the customer.
Not bad at all. I'm certain the customer\nwill be pleased.
It's... not great, but we shouldn't leave\nthe customer waiting. Let's just\nhand it over.
You helped keep things running smoothly.Thanks!
Well, here's today's pay.
You're free to go now. See you next time!
There sure are a lot of humans who like\neating sweet things. Hoohoo, what a pure and\nsimple expression of desire!
Good to see you!
We're expecting a rush of customers soon.\nGood luck!
You've become quite adept at taking care\nof customers.
Keep working at your usual pace, and you\nshould have no issues today.
Thanks so much for today! You have no idea\nhow much that helped.
Here. This is today's pay.
If you've got time, come back and\nhelp out again!
Your face shows the satisfaction of a\njob well done.
Let's clean up and return home.
Thanks for coming in! You'll be serving\ncustomers today, okay?
You probably heard, but lately our Gourmet\nSpecial Strawberry Cr\xeape has been trending\non social media...
Hmm... This next customer is staring at\ntheir phone too. They must be checking\nthose trends as well.
Whoa! That's the one! I've been wanting\nto try that ever since I saw it online!
Oh, I don't think that's it... I wanted the\none I saw online, with strawberries in it.
Great work!
Here's what you earned today.
Hope to see you again!
Can I get you to help with cooking today?
Alright, thanks. I'm counting on you!
One choco banana, please!
Hoomph. According to the procedure, you just\nput in the filling and wrap it up. Take it\neasy and you should have no problem.
The banana goes in first. Then, the only\ningredient left is...
I don't think that's it. Let's think again.\nIt's a choco banana cr\xeape...
Alright, looks like you're finished.
Thanks again for your help today!
Ahh, so you must be our new part-time\nemployee, huh?
I'm always happy to see one of Shun's\nfriends come by.
Hahaha, you seem like a hard worker! I'm\nsure I can count on you for all sorts\nof things.
We'll just get you acquainted with the shop\ntoday. I'll give ya some pointers here\nand there.
Yamagoshi seems to be right back to his\nold self.
Hoom. So you'll be starting with dishwashing\nduty today.
It's a good place to start.
Take care not to break any of the bowls.
You've finished washing all those dishes...\nThis truly is a popular place.
Would ya look at that! You finished washing\nall those bowls. I knew I could count on you.
Thanks to you, I can focus all my attention\non crafting my ramen.
Right. Here's what you earned today.
By the way, if you happen to see Shun, tell\nhim to stop by and see me, all right?
My customers are coming back and business\nis booming. But I think we're still short\non hands.
Perhaps your valiant dishwashing efforts\nwill be of aid to Yamagoshi, hm?
If you've got some time later, why not come\nback and help out some more?
Oh, you're back! Good to see ya!
You've certainly got the spirit. I won't\nmake you wash dishes today, though.\nGot something else you can help with.
Shun told me you're quite the talented chef.
I've been working on a curry for our secret\nmenu. I was hoping you could help with that.
It's a simple recipe I used to make for the\nkitchen staff, so I'll teach you how to\nmake it real quick.
You'll want to heat up the spices in the pot\nfirst, 'til you can smell 'em. Then add the\nmeat, potatoes, and carrots in order.
Add some water, simmer it for 20 minutes,\nthen finish it off with a splash of\ncoconut milk.
Did you get all that?
Alright then, let's get to it.
If everything's ready, let's start making\nthe curry.
You remember the steps Yamagoshi told you,\nright? The first thing is...
I don't believe he said to simmer it\nright away.
We'll add the ingredients next. The order\nto put them in was...
Are you certain that's what he told you?
Hoo, that's correct.
What a marvelous fragrance...
Well then, the finishing touch is a splash\nof coconut milk. Do you remember when to\nput it in?
Doesn't that seem too early?
That's too long to let it simmer...
Hm, that timing sounds just right.
It's finished.
Let's have Yamagoshi do a taste test.
Oh, not bad. You really do know your way\naround a kitchen. This is perfectly seasoned.
Well, here's what I owe you for today.
Feel free to come back and help whenever\nyou want.
That was a challenging task, but you passed\nwith flying colors.
That bold use of seasoning seems to have\npaid off.
Ah, you came just at the right time!
One of the other part-timers called out\nsick, and we're swamped with orders.
Take care of the dining area, would you?
Just tell me the orders here, and we'll\nbe all good!
It really is crowded.
Better get moving and take some orders.
Ramen and gyoza, please!
Another ramen for me, too!
One order of gyoza over here.
I'll take an order of gyoza as well.
Looks like that's all the customers' orders\nfor the time being.
Do you remember all of that?
Hey, can you tell me what they ordered?
Eh? You sure about that?
Good work. I'll handle it from here.
Once I've made 'em, you can take 'em to\nthe customers.
Looks like that's the end of it.
I'm glad to see you took all those orders\nwithout incident.
Alright, the orders are ready, so let's\nserve them.
Ah, thank you! You've been a great help.
Here's what you made today. And I slipped a\nlittle extra in there for your trouble.
You did some great work today.\nCome back anytime.
It was a busy day, but I'd say it was\na fulfilling one.
Judging from your expression, I'm guessing\nyou agree.
Well, now, let's go home and get some rest,\nshall we?
Thanks for coming.
Looks like you're getting the hang of\nworking here, aren't you?
Thanks for your help, as always.
Hmm... The shop's bustling again today.
You'll have no shortage of tasks today.
Taking orders, washing dishes, or perhaps\nmaking curry...
Well then, let's see how we can help out\nYamagoshi today.
You've become a fine hand at this.
No matter what the task, you handle it\nwith ease.
You've had sufficient practice, so this all\nmust be a breeze for you.
Time to head home and rest.
Thanks for coming in again today.
It's good to see that business continues\nto stay strong.
Phew. You really helped out again today.
Here's what you earned. Thanks again.
You seem satisfied.
It's not too busy today, so I'd like it if\nyou could help make some curry.
Yep, looks like I can leave all the\ncurry-making to you. You've come\na long way, haven't you?
You look quite pleased with yourself today.
Am I glad to see you! We could really use\nyour help right now.
We're packed with customers today, so it's\na bit hectic...
I'll focus on the kitchen, so I'll leave\nall the customer orders to you.
You're workin' here today too, huh?
There's still a ton of dirty dishes, so let's\nknock those out first.
Thanks, man!
Let's eat in the kitchen then head home.
Later.
We're in the kitchen today. Uhh, I'll leave\nthat section to you.
Never would I have imagined Shun bringing\nhis friends here... let alone as an extra\npair of hands.
Here, this is today's pay.
Oh, and feel free to use my kitchen. Eat\nsomething before you leave.
You're lookin' hale and hearty, Pops.\nSometimes I stop by 'cause I'm worried.
Wait here, I'll make us something. You're\nhungry, right?
See ya.
Perfect timin'. Today is nuts.
The staff has their hands full, so we gotta\nback 'em up!
Ugh, I'm beat.
You saved us today. We would've been\noverwhelmed with our usual numbers.
Let's take a breather then head home.
Back for more, huh?
You and Tomoko-chan really helped us out\nthe other day.
You're both such hard workers. I'll be\ncounting on you again today.
Since you're here by yourself this time...\nCould I get you to hop on register?
You really are dependable! Well, then,\nyou know what to do.
Oh, and remember you can't pick out the\nmedicine for the customer. You're not a\npharmacist, after all.
Do your best to memorize the shelf locations.\nThen you'll be able to help\ncustomers find what they need.
For example, the adhesive bandages are on\nthis shelf next to the register.
And cough drops are on shelf 3 near\nthe checkout, as well.
The manual lists the locations for\neverything we sell, so give it a read if you\nhave some time.
Excuse me, do you have any cough drops?
I'm fairly certain the manager told us\nwhere cough drops are. Do you recall?
Huh? I didn't see any there...
Oh, thanks! I'll go take a look.
Good work! That's it for today.
And here. This is your pay.
If you've got the time, I hope you'll\ncome again!
Not a bad job, I'd say.
There's much to be learned from customer\nservice jobs. Perhaps you should continue in\nthe future?
Thanks for coming! We could use the help.
We're very busy today... Sorry for throwing\nyou into this, but could you start\nright away?
You'll earn some bonus pay!
Ah, that's right. I was hoping you could\nread the manual and learn the locations of\nall the shelves.
Good, try to commit all the details to\nmemory. Particularly the items most frequently\nrequested by customers.
It appears the first wave of customers is\napproaching. Let's concentrate on our work.
Urgh... I can't stand all this overtime...\nDo you sell any energy drinks?
I just checked over there, but it looked\nlike it was just daily necessities...
Huh? Maybe I missed something...
I'll go take another look...
Thanks! I found them.
If he's feeling that enervated, shouldn't he\nsimply rest? I fail to understand...
Oof, my stomach... I ate way too much...\nWhere's the antacids?
I don't believe that's right.
Thank you so, so much. Urgh, I really hope\nthis does something...
Looking good. Try to maintain this pace.
Good work! You're free to go now.
You really helped out by coming in today.
Here's your pay for today. And as promised,\nyou earned a bonus rate.
Thanks again! And be careful getting home!
Even in such chaotic conditions, you were\nable to provide excellent service.
You must have felt such compassion for the\nneeds of others today.
The shift went by without incident.
A commendable job.
Thanks for your hard work!
Working with others is truly enlightening.\nIt would be worthwhile to come back.
So glad you could make it! It's another busy\none today.
Meaning you'll earn extra. Now hop to it!
Great work today! You were a big help.
Here's your pay, along with the extra\nI promised!
It was busy, but you made it through without\nissue. You've become quite adept here, too.
Working with others is truly enlightening.\nIt would behoove us to come back,\nwouldn't you agree?
Oh! We're both on today. How lucky!
The customers have been streaming in for a\nwhile. It's pretty busy, but we can do it!
Nice work! It got pretty crazy there...
But thanks to you, we made it through.
I already knew you were super kind, but it's\ndifferent seeing it firsthand.
Anyway, see you later!
Oh, we're both scheduled today! Nice!
I'm going to arrange the shelves while we\nhave some down time.
Would you mind being on the register?
Thanks for today! With you here, I could\nreally get the shelves nice and neat.
Even work can be fun if it's with someone\nyou can count on!
Well, catch you later!
You came back! And right when we're\nshort-staffed. Perfect timing!
When you and the girl were here together, I\nwas thoroughly impressed.
Glad to have you here again!
Scuse me. I don't remember the title but I'm\nlooking for an adventure novel set in space.
Yes, that's the one! "Through the Cosmos!" The\nhero gallops through space on a horse!
It's like you read my mind! Thanks!
This looks like a generic sci-fi novel...
I'll find it myself. Thanks anyway.
This looks like a magical girl manga...
Hoohoo! You know your books. I suppose I\nshouldn't be surprised.
The customers won't be pleased if you make\nwild guesses.
Great job today! You nailed it.
You're welcome to drop in any time.
Thanks for coming by again! We're running a\nspecial deal today, so it's quite busy.
Everyone who buys a how-to book or manga gets\na special gift.
You'll make more since it's so hectic today.\nBreak a leg!
The gifts are a metal charm for how-to books\nand a bookmark for manga.
Both genres are sure to sell fast, so stay on\nyour toes!
Remember, metal charms for how-to books and\nbookmarks for manga. Good luck!
Just as the manager predicted,\nit's packed...
Best hop to it.
I'm ready to check out.
Looks like the next installment of a\nmanga series.
This comes with a gift. Make sure you give\nthem the right one.
Yes, that's exactly right.
Hey! Give them the gift for manga.
Just this today.
Looks like a how-to book. Don't forget to\ngive them their gift.
Indeed. That's the correct gift, to be sure.
They bought a how-to book, so they should get\na metal charm.
H-hoo!? Get your hands off me! I'm not a\nspecial giveaway!
Great work today! You're a lifesaver!
I don't think we would've made it through the\nday if you hadn't come by to help out.
Well then, here's your pay.
Hope to see you again soon!
Things got quite hectic, but you handled it\nwith ease. You truly have grown.
Thanks for coming in!
Mind getting started right away?
Great work today, and thanks for coming in!
You've become quite the natural here.
Great work today. Thanks for coming in again!
Busy as it was, you didn't even break a sweat.
We're on the same shift today. What luck!
I'll sort the shelves while it's not\ntoo busy.
Could you watch the register in the\nmeantime?
You sure know a lot books. I'm impressed!
Later! Hopefully we get to work together\nagain soon.
This time I'll be on register and you can\nget the shelves.
Those customers won't know what hit \u2018em!
Hey, could you tell me about the new shipment\nthat came in?
Thanks. I'm trying to learn everything I can\nuntil the next job.
Oh! We're on together again today. Nice!
Looks like there's a special today. It'll be\nbusy, but we'll make it work!
Nice work! It really was crazy, huh?
I'm not sure I could've managed if you\nhadn't been there!
Good with customers and well-read to boot!\nYou've been a great help today.
Anyway, see you next time!
So you're the new part-timer, huh?\nThank goodness.
Our shop's been crazy busy. I'm thankful,\nof course, but that means it gets\ncrazy hectic!
The job's pretty straightforward. There's\njust not a lot of downtime!
It might be a bit rough at first, but the\nbusier it is, the more money you'll make!
Good luck!
It really is a popular shop.\nThe stream customers seems\nto have no end...
Great work! You some kind of robot? No one's\never been that good on their first day.
Lemme guess, are you too a die-hard\ncroquette fan? Either way, you were a\nhuge help!
Here's your pay. Come back soon, 'kay?
It's only been one day, but you seem to have\ngained a wealth of knowledge on croquettes.
Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely, but\nperhaps we should change clothes\nbefore heading home?
You came back! Glad to have you.
I'll leave all the customers to you. You're\njust that capable!
Let's see... I'll take one potato croquette\nand one roast pork!
Hoohoo, that's right. Well calculated.
Hey, that's too much! Try again...!
Great work as always! Here's your pay.
You really are a natural! What did we ever\ndo without you?
Stop by any time.
You had to calculate every bill, so your\nmental math must be in tip-top shape!
Hoohoo... All the oil smells lovely, but\nperhaps we should change before heading home?
Thanks for coming in! We're super\nshort-staffed today!
It's always busy, but today's especially\ncrazy. You'll get a pay boost, of course, so\ncan I count on you?
What a preposterously long line...!
In times like this, staying level headed is\ncrucial. Don't panic and all will be well.
Five beef croquettes, please.
Exactly! Bravo.
You've doubled the amount, try again!
That's far too cheap! I understand it's busy,\nbut this is no time for games.
Lately, our kid is obsessed with pork belly\nskewers! We'll take six.
Hey, that's far too low! Try again.
Hey! This is a business, not a charity!
Great work today! You really came in clutch!
Here's your pay! I added a little extra for\nthe hard work you put in!
Come back when you get the chance. You're\nalways welcome here!
It was busier than ever but you calculated\nwith ease. You truly continue to impress.
Today you're on stocking duty! Once they're\nready, put them out for the customers, \u2018kay?
I'm counting on you!
The scent of meat in the air is divine...\nThe fact that you can focus at all\nis commendable.
Hey! The meatballs are about to sell out.\nGo grab some more from the back.
Great work today! Thanks to you, we didn't\nrun out of a single thing!
Here's your pay for the day! Come back\nanytime. We're always happy to have you!
You quickly picked up the job through mere\nobservation. A remarkable feat, indeed.
Thanks for coming in! When it's busy, things\njust don't run the same without you.
I'll leave the customers to you!
I'll take a bite-sized pork cutlet and some\nmeatballs, please!
Can I have five fried potato mochi, please?
Your clothes smell veritably deep-fried!\nGo change and let's go home.
I'm counting on you today! I'm sure you\nwon't disappoint.
Here's your pay. Always glad to have you!
You handled the customers well. I expected\nno less from you.
It's packed today. This certainly isn't the\nideal environment for studying.
It's noisy and customers are constantly\nentering and leaving. This may not be the\nbest place to focus.
Hoo hoo! To think you were able to\nconcentrate amidst all this distraction.
It seems your efforts paid off despite the\nhustle and bustle.
Hoom... You could hear a feather drop. Why,\nit's the perfect environment for studying!
It seems you were able to concentrate\nrather well.
It's about to get quite crowded in here.\nShall we get going?
Hoom. It's quiet and peaceful here.
This seems to be an optimal studying\nenvironment.
Complete quiet isn't for everyone. Studying\naround others seems to suit you.
You seem to have made good progress. We'll\nhave to come back again sometime.
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.
Shall we call it a day?
Not a very efficient study session, I'm\nafraid. You did manage to make some\nprogress, though.
Hoom... Now looks to be a good stopping\npoint. Shall we head out?
The rain outside is creating a peaceful\natmosphere. Quite ideal for a study session,\nis it not?
The perfect environment truly gives rise\nto success!
I can tell you progressed by leaps and bounds!
It's not as busy as usual, perhaps due to\nthe rain.
Hoo my, you are truly in the zone. I'll\nleave you to it.
Now that's a look of satisfaction. Your\nconcentration was truly a sight to behold.
It is worth coming back, hoom? Well, shall we\nhead home?
Your pen hasn't moved for quite\nsome time.
Is concentration eluding you?
Hoom, you don't seem to be making\nmuch progress.
We all have those days, I suppose.\nHow about we pack up and get going?
Hoo! Your pen hasn't stopped moving!\nYour rapid progress is nothing short\nof incredible.
Hoo hoo! You made it this far already?
It seems you are truly in the zone today.
It's not good to push yourself too hard,\nthough. Why don't we call it a day here?
Have you finished warming up?
Don't hold back!
Harder! Faster! Show me what you can do!
Well done.
It seems your brutal training has honed\nboth your mind and body.
Hoom, you look thoroughly spent.
How about cooling down and heading out?
What an elegant facade. Is this a bathhouse?
It is certainly quite different from the bath\nat home, hoom?
Hoom... There are even days with medicinal\nbaths. They're sure to have many effects.
Hoohoo! You look mightily refreshed.
In fact, you're practically glowing!
There is nothing wrong with a bath at home,\nbut bathhouses have an appeal all their own.
If you wish to become more charming, it may\nbenefit you to visit regularly.
Now that you're rejuvenated, shall we\nreturn home?
Hey, haven't you been in there a little\ntoo long?
Any longer and the wonderful effects from the\nbath will go to waste.
You certainly seem to be feeling its\nmedicinal benefits, though...
Physical training, you say? A fine idea.
They appear to have even more obscure\nequipment here.
Hoom, what on earth? Is that... a wooden\ntraining dummy?
It appears that using this dummy as a\nsparring partner would allow you attain\na full-body workout.
Hoom... There don't seem to be many other\npeople using it.
Meaning you're certain to train your spirit\nas well as your body here!
You're holding back! Remember, the dummy is\nyour enemy!
Yes! That's more like it!
Fight like you mean it! That's it! Keep it\ncoming!
Hoom, you look thoroughly spent. How about\ncooling down and heading out?
The trainers gave you a special sports drink.
Drinking it should improve the results of\nyour workout.
May as well drink it before your workout.
Excellent form! Keep it up!
What a magnificently productive session!
Hoohoo. I can tell from your face that\nyou agree.
You keep things in good order as it is.\nA little more cleaning should hardly prove difficult.
The effort you put into tidying your room\nis proof enough.
By cleaning up even more thoroughly, your\nconsideration will surely flourish.
Very well. Once you've finished preparing,\nyou can get to cleaning.
Hoom... Were the corners truly this dusty?\nWell spotted.
Well done. A clean room fosters peace of\nmind.
By cleaning every nook and cranny, your\nconscientiousness will reach new heights.
Now, all that remains is putting away the\ncleaning supplies.
Let's clean every inch of this room until\nit's spotless.
Keep in mind that proper cleaning requires\ncareful consideration.
Hoohoo! Not a single speck of dust!
You already keep it very neat...
So, there shouldn't be any egregious messes.\nInstead, clean where you don't normally look.
You'd be surprised by how much dust gathers.
Hoom? Why is there dirt here of all places?
I'd say that about does it for today. It\nfeels good as new, doesn't it?
A video game?
From my understanding, games allow you to\nenjoy experiences otherwise unavailable to you, yes?
In other words, one could say they bring\nyour fantasies to life.
For example, in this game you become the\nhero and defeat the demon king.
To be someone special and gain acclaim.\nThat's the desire being fulfilled here, yes?
I've heard there is a great deal of\nvariety, too.
I ask that you play all manner of games so\nthat I might learn more about human desires.
Which means you'll first need to beat\nthis one!
After all, our own adventure has only just\nbegun!
Will we play as a different protagonist\ngoing forward?
I see... Seeing the story from a different\nperspective provides us with more nuance.
Though at times like these, it helps to review\nwhat's already happened.
Hoom... Time seems to have flown by.
We shall have to pick up where we left off\nat a later date.
You see, even I have heard the phrase "when\nit comes to games, don't play more than an hour a day."
Which character will you choose next time?\nI'll let you think on it.
Ah yes, the story continues.
Hoom... We want to progress the story, but\nthis boss is quite challenging.
Perhaps the difficulty level is too high?
We somehow managed to beat the boss.
Overcoming the enemy's strength may have\nbeen a crucial step in our journey.
That was quite the difficult session. Let's\nstop there for today.
It seems you can play a previously completed\nstage at a higher difficulty...
Very well. Let's give it our all.
Hoom... So the route you take is key. If you\ndon't progress efficiently, your enemies\nwill outmatch you.
Wha\u2014! The boss is truly formidable!
Be sure to use your skills wisely!
That was a close one...
But our victory was the natural result of\nutilizing strategy.
By continuing to efficiently defeat enemies,\nyou'll be able to adapt to anything.
You must be mentally drained. I believe\nthat's enough for today.
Hoom. How about hopping on the\ntreadmill today?
It may be a tad tiresome running in place\nwith unchanging scenery...
But it does allow you to run come rain or shine.
Hoom, you're going too fast. Pace yourself.
Did I not say you would overwork yourself?
You must be exhausted. Perhaps it is time to\nhead home and rest?
Another day on the treadmill?
Take care not to trip.
Hoom... Could you try running for me again?
Your courage allows you to challenge yourself\nand push past your limits. Thank you for\nallowing me to see it.
You look positively beat. Why not head home\nafter a brief respite?
Hoo hoo, taking on the bench press today?
In addition to upper body strength, it's\nimportant to regulate your pace, which takes\npractice.
Shall we begin?
Hey, isn't it a bit unreasonable to start\nwith that amount of weight?
As I suspected...
Though I commend your courage to take on\nsuch a challenge.
You're certainly brimming with energy and\nstamina today.
I imagine heavier weights will prove no\nmatch for you today.
Hoo hoo, excellent form!
You really had the tenacity to overcome your\nlimits. Incredible.
Ah, an action game today?
Why don't you show me your aim?
Your technique could use some refinement.
Intense focus takes its toll. Why not call\nit a day?
A modicum of rest will benefit your future\nprogress.
Let us continue another time.
Ah, a more toothsome level to try...
This fight looks to be quite the challenge,\nbut far be it from me to try and stop you.
Now then, show me what you're capable of.
Hoohoo! What ferocious offense! How will you\nturn the tides?
A splendid display of combat!
The boss is stunned! Seize your chance!
All right, looks like you handled that well.
What a spectacular outcome. I believe it's\nfair to say you rank among the top in this\ngame.
Greater accomplishments await you. Let us\ncontinue another time.
Playing games outside is quite refreshing.
Are you ready? Then let's begin.
Spot the target and wait for a clear shot...\nPerhaps this can double as firearms training.
Pay close attention. Enemies will appear at\nthe edges of the screen.
Hoom... It appears that we lost.
I think you did quite well, considering this\ngame was unfamiliar to you.
Let us try again some other time.
Ah, you seem to be doing well today.
I look forward to seeing your score climb.
You're predicting the next attack based on\ntheir movements! What discerning judgment!
Perfect! You defeated the boss with\nsuch ease!
With such focus, you'll make it to the final\nlevel in no time!
Seems you've beaten your old high score.
What a fulfilling use of our time.
Ah, time flies. Let us leave for now and try\nagain some other time.
Tending to the plants in the garden?
Be careful as you handle them. They can be\nquite delicate.
Hoom... I can tell you care for these plants\nby your tender administrations.
I see you've finished tending to the plants.
I think that's enough for today.
Today, the whole garden needs your attention.
There seem to be cracks in that pot.
Be sure to take good care of your tools,\nas well as your plants.
Hoo hoo! It's so beautiful now I barely\nrecognize it!
All that careful work must have been tiring.\nI think that's enough for today.
The cats are gathering...
I'm not very good with cats... Perhaps, you\nshould be the one to play with them.
Well, the they seem to have departed.
Hoom. Interacting with those animals seems\nto have had a positive effect on you.
What's with that look? I'm not some kind of\nanimal like they are!
Hey, aren't you forgetting something?
Yes, milk! I've heard there is nothing like\na cold bottle of milk after a hot bath.
Now, drink up.
Hoo hoo! You downed it in one gulp!
I told you, it's impossible! You can't eat\nthat much!
*belch* I'm no quitter! This time was a \nbust, but next time...
I'll finish every last drop of the\nUniverse-Sized Ramen!
Big words, pal. In that case, call me next\ntime you challenge Victory Kitchen!
Victory Kitchen... That's the ramen shop in\nShinjuku. Let's visit when we have\nthe chance.
A contest for gorging on as much food as\npossible... Sounds like a fine event awash\nwith desire.
There appear to be three ramen sizes:\nLarge, Extra Large and Universe-sized.
Universe-sized...? I shudder to think.\nWhy not step up to the challenge?
Welcome! Oh, it's you! Care to try our\nEating Challenge?
It's our shop's latest idea. The first stage\nis the Large-sized Challenge.
One large, then! Comin' right up!
L-Look at those noodles! This is the size of a\nsmall mountain!
Surprised? Don't worry, we didn't compromise\non flavor!
Most customers can't handle the large,\nso don't let your guard down.
Finish it, and you'll earn a fabulous cash prize!
You can't lose now... Think of the prize!\nGood luck, {NAME2}!
Okay, you have 30 minutes to complete the\nLarge-sized Challenge!
Ready, set... Eat!
Don't panic! Use your chopsticks to lift and\neat the noodles as they cool!
Ah, what a pity... Still, you did as best\nyou could.
You'll need more training to best this ramen.
Regardless, you put in a valiant effort\nagainst that enormous ramen bowl.
Wh-What!? Incredible! You actually finished\nthat huge bowl of ramen!
Congratulations! You beat the Large-sized\nChallenge!
For this achievement...
...your fabulous prize is 3,500 yen!\nImpressive work!
Now that you've conquered the Large-sized\nChallenge, you can proceed to the next stage.
Let us know when you're ready to take\non the Extra Large-sized Challenge.\nWe'll be waiting!
You were superb, {NAME2}!
I was especially shocked by how you deftly\nused your chopsticks to cool the noodles!
The way you scooped every last noodle from the\nbroth was masterful as well.
Well, let's return home. I'm full simply from\nwatching you...
Welcome! Oh, are you here to take on our\nEating Challenge again?
The next stage is the Extra Large-sized\nChallenge! Think you've got what it takes?
Extra large, hoom...? In other words, it must\noutsize even the large!
Okay, you have 30 minutes to complete the\nExtra Large-sized Challenge!
Keep calm and assess your stomach's limits.\nRemember to pace yourself.
Although you failed, I admired the bold way\nyou inhaled those noodles.
You'll need to train more if you wish to best this\nramen.
Still, I could see you put thought into how\nto approach it.
M-My word! You actually managed to devour\nthat formidable heap of ramen!
Congratulations! You beat the Extra\nLarge-sized Challenge with flying colors!
I present you your cash prize of 6,000 yen!
Boy, you really tackled that bowl with gusto!
The final stage is our Universe-sized\nChallenge. We'll be waiting!
You didn't eat too quickly or let the noodles\nsit too long. Each move was well calculated.
Hoo hoo. It was truly a feast for the eyes.\nWell, shall we be going?
Welcome! We've been waiting... You're here to\ntake our Eating Challenge, right?
This is our biggest ramen... You could say it's the final boss.
And the name of our pride and joy is...
...the Universe-sized Ramen!
A-Absurd! How is this ramen!?\nWhat inconceivable girth!
Hehe. We went to painstaking effort to make\nthis colossal bowl of ramen a reality...
The volume and flavor of our noodles, soup,\nmeat, and toppings can't be beat.
It's our restaurant's best and tastiest bowl.\nPlease enjoy!
If you finish it, the greatest honor and\ncash prize will be yours!
What prodigious desire! Is this even\nsurmountable?
Okay, you have 30 minutes to complete the\nUniverse-sized Challenge!
Hey, your chopsticks are slowing down!\nDon't tell me the sheer quantity has you\noverwhelmed!
Oh, what a pity... Our opponent was much\ntoo great...
Still, I respect the courage you displayed in\nthe face of insurmountable odds. It was a\nremarkable effort!
I-I can't believe my eyes... You truly\ndevoured that ramen behemoth!
Unbelievable...! You actually beat the\nUniverse-sized Challenge!
In recognition of your incredible\naccomplishment...
...I present to you our store's grand prize\nof 10,000 yen!
I'm so happy, I could almost cry. As a ramen\nchef, it fills me with great pride to see our\nultimate dish eaten with such delight.
That Universe-sized Ramen is our biggest\nsize, so we don't have any greater challenge\nto offer you...
...But feel free to try it again anytime!\nFor universe champions, it's on the house!
Come back soon!
I'm still flabbergasted you finished the\nUniverse-sized Ramen...
It was fascinating to watch you fearlessly\ntake on endless ramen.
You were brilliant, {NAME2}!
Welcome! Oh, our champion has returned!
Back to retake the Universe-sized Challenge?\nComin' right up!
Here's your Universe-sized Ramen! Enjoy!
Carve your path to victory!
Hoo hoo! Good show! I'd expect no less of\nyou, {NAME2}!
Wow, you finished the Universe-sized Ramen\nagain!
Unfortunately, we can only award you the\ngrand prize once...
But you're welcome to take on the\nUniverse-sized Ramen again anytime\nyou like. It's on the house!
I'm honored to witness such a daring feat.\nNow, let's be on our way.
There's surely some benefit to such vocal\nexpression.
Hoom... Your singing certainly has room for\nimprovement.
Your singing has improved. Practice truly\ndoes pay off.
You've developed quite a melodious singing\nvoice!
I'm pleased to hear the notable improvement.
What wonderful singing! Your voice carried\nsuch raw emotion.
Your growth is reflected in your score. At\nthis rate, a perfect score is just beyond\nthe horizon.
Incredible! Even mountains would succumb to\nyour moving tenor!
Congratulations on your perfect score!
You earned a special prize for your\nachievement.
A passable performance, I'd say.
What a wonderfully dulcet voice...
What a perfect song! I only wish my wings\nwere better suited to applause.
You're welcome to stay for as long as\nyou'd like.
I'm astounded there is such a quiet retreat\nnear the shopping district.
It's an ideal moment to relax.
Is something on your mind? You've been silent\nfor a while now.
Oh? Whatever is the matter?
It appears you've hit upon something.
What a scenic hideaway in the city.
It would seem you've recalled something.
What a tranquil retreat. We should visit\nagain to rejuvenate.
Hoo... It's nice to rest like this every once\nin a while.
What is it? You look as if you've recalled\nsomething.
You seem eager to confirm something. Very\nwell, let's be on our way.
What a pleasant breeze.
It appears lightning has struck.
You've had an insightful day I see.\nWell then, shall we head home?
I, too, feel at peace here.
It would seem you've had an epiphany.
Appears you've gained something of import.\nShall we return home?
Hoo... That cloud looks like braised pork...
It would seem you've gathered your thoughts.
It seems you gained some new understanding,\nwhilst I gained a craving for braised pork.
It's particularly quiet today.
Hoo!? What is it? You suddenly grew pale.
Hoom... For some reason, you're aglow with a\nsense of triumph.
It looks as if you've conquered a fear.\nWell, shall we call it a day?
This place is always so pleasant\nand meticulously maintained.
What is it? From your expression, it appears\ninspiration has struck.
Well, shall we head back?
Your home is comfortable, but I find this\nplace equally soothing.
You look rather inspired.
I can tell you've gained something of import.
Now, shall we be on our way?
Many birds flock here, but the mere sight of\nme frightens them away...
What is it? Has something occurred to you?
You appear preoccupied.
You seem to have remembered something.
Hoohoo, you appear deep in thought. What a\nkindly countenance.
The hustle and bustle of the shopping\ndistrict outside is inaudible here.
What is it? You look pensive.
Hoom, I sense a minor shift in your aura.
What silent serenity. Here, we many find\nreprieve from all worldly thoughts.
Hoom? Has your posture improved? You could\nbe mistaken for a Zen master with such a\nstatuesque pose.
Hoohoo, you were quite entrenched in your\nthoughts. Well then, shall we be off?
Welcome! Oh? You're a young one.
We also have non-alcoholic drinks available.\nGo ahead and sit wherever you like.
Hoo, this bar has a unique ambience. I sense\ndesire not found elsewhere.
Today's special drink should be a sensible\nchoice.
What an ostentatious color. It would be\nimpossible to surmise the flavor...
Hoom, it looks like it did not disappoint.
Hoohoo. We're here, so why not relax and\nenjoy the bar's ambience?
I'm curious about today's special drink.
My, what a lovely hue. However, we've yet to\nsample it.
I take it the drink is to your liking. Shall\nwe order another?
Let's enjoy ourselves a while longer before\nreturning home.
I wonder what today's special could be.
Hm. The hue makes it look palatable, but...
Oh? Your expression has shifted. Hoohoo, you\nlook like you're one of the regulars now.
Hoohoo, since we're here, why not savor the\nmoment a while longer?
Today's special drink is only available for\na limited-time, but it's quite... peculiar.
The colors commingle yet remain beautifully\nharmonious within the glass.
Hoohoo, whatever could it taste like? Go on,\ngive it a try.
You seem stunned.
These new flavors have certainly brought\nabout a change in you.
We're in no hurry, so let's enjoy ourselves.
The hue tells us scant little of the taste.
Hoohoo, your face brims with confidence.\nWhile we're here, might as well take a moment\nto unwind.
What a stunning drink. Whatever could it\ntaste like?
Slow down. I understand your enthusiasm,\nbut the drink isn't going anywhere.
Still, what could have produced this\nmysterious hue?
Hoom, this drink has a tranquil hue, but...
Hoo, your expression has changed. You have\nthe look of someone who frequents\nthis establishment.
Let's make the most of our time here and\ntake the chance to unwind.
Apparently this special drink is rarely\navailable. What luck!
Go on, take a sip.
Hoo, the subtle flavor is to your liking? It\nseems your expression has softened as well.
Hoom? {NAME2}?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Hey, can you hear me? Could it be that you've\nfallen asleep?
Do try to stay alert. Well, if you must...\nTake a short rest if you wish.
{NAME2}?
You're free to enjoy the aroma, but I also\nrequire your attention... Are you listening?
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, wake up!
I understand you're relaxed, but who falls\nasleep like that?
Hoo, how skilled. You even saved on materials.
Hoo, how skilled. You even made extra.
Why, for your very first tool, this is\nexpertly made.
What craftsmanship! You saved on materials\nwithout compromising quality.
My folks are away on business. I love the\nfreedom, but now I'm low on cash...
Get a part-time job, then. It's not against\nschool rules or anything.
Plus, a lot of places are short-staffed right\nnow and looking for help.
A part-time job? Ugh, sounds like a pain.
I don't wanna wooork... There's gotta be a\nsuper easy job somewhere, right?
Guess I'll check out a few job huntin' apps...
A part-time job... The Phantom Thieves do\nneed funds to operate. Why not get one too?
Hoohoo, such initiative.
Don't sound so pathetic.
Don't be ridiculous. What business would hire\nan owl?
You'll find various leads on job search apps.
If a job interests you, add it to your\nscheduled activities.
Let's start with a place looking to hire\nstudents and branch out from there.
Why the hell are exams even a thing?\nLike, seriously...
Even if I get a good score, what good\nwill it do?
It's not like I wanna go to the best\nuniversity or anything.
Ughhh, what's the freaking point\nof studying?
Can't we leave all the book crap\nto the nerds? They actually like it.
I thought humans were highly\ninquisitive creatures.
But it seems these ones have lost their\nintellectual desire.
Study is always beneficial, no matter the\nfield. That reminds me, there's a bookstore\nin Shibuya.
With a book you can study anywhere,\neven at home.
Onto other news...
Research has shown lifestyle diseases are\nprevalent among today's youth.
Cases are up since last year, and officials\nstrive to promote a healthy lifestyle.
Now for the weather...
Hoom... So, today's humans have even lost\ntheir desire to stay healthy?
The situation is dire. You must also remain\nvigilant.
As I recall, there are gyms in Shibuya.\nWhy not pay one a visit?
Physical fitness is essential, even for\nPhantom Thieves.
Are you doing all right on your own? Have you\nbeen eating properly?
We're doing fine! Your dad and I are having\na great vacation!
Since it's been a while, we're taking our\ntime to really take in the sights.
We'll be gone for a bit, so watch the house!\nWe'll bring you back souvenirs!
My cat comes home all muddy lately...
Really? What a little rascal. Well, he's\nliving his best kitty life.
But, I'm still worried! What if he got caught\nup in the wrong crowd?
"The wrong crowd?" Well, the feline world is\ncomplex too, I'm sure.
Ah, speaking of cats... I hear there's a fat\norange cat around Zoshigaya.
It sneaks into houses, steals food, and even\nattacks other cats...
It's famous in the neighborhood.
There's a cat like that!? Oh no! I hope my\nlittle kitty isn't being bullied...
I heard that soccer movie is killin' it at\nthe box office.
Oh, you mean "Shaolin Slackers" playing at the\ntheater in Shibuya right now!
It's about a group of martial artists\nwho fight to reclaim their forest in\nan international soccer tournament!
The way they stood up for their beliefs\nreally got me fired up!
Nothin' motivates me lately. Maybe that'll\nchange if I watch it too?
Wanna stop by the theater on our way home?
I see there are many reasons why humans would\nbe inclined to visit the cinema.
If it is to find fulfillment, then perhaps\nwatching movies is, in itself, an act of\ndesire.
Do you know that mascot at Station Square?
It's Shichi-kun, Shibuya's unofficial mascot.
Since when...? That's news to me.
And I'm in Shibuya all the time.
It's nuts over there. There's even a little\ngirl that asks you to donate to cats...
There are all sorts out there.
One kid had a guitar but wasn't singing when\nI passed by.
She was pretty cute though, so she'll\nprobably go far.
It won't be so easy. These days you need to\ngo viral to get anywhere.
True. I'm way more into Menaces than guitar\nvids!
*yawn* Damn, I'm so tired...
Not again... You stayed up late gaming,\ndidn't you?
You got me... I've been playing this super\naddictive new action game!
Landin' combos is so satisfying! Like, who's\ngot time for sleep playing that!?
And now you're runnin' on empty. I seriously\ndon't get it.
Well, wake yourself up. I ain't gonna help if\nyou nod off in class.
A desire that surpasses sleep... How\nintriguing.
I'd like to try this game which holds humans\nso captive.
You've a game console at home, yes? Let's\nplay when we get back.
I was at the bookstore on Central Street\nyesterday and had to wait in line forever.
I wondered if it was some kind of problem,\nthen saw only one cashier.
Seriously? I was stuck in line for ages at\nthe pharmacy too.
Everywhere's been short-staffed lately.
At this rate, we won't be able to shop like\nnormal...
What choice do we have? It's not like we plan\nto work.
Right, let's start practice.
What song should we do?
That's all for today! Great job, everyone!
Okay, let's do this! Get fired up!
That's a wrap, people! Good work today!
Oh my god, I bought way too much last week.\nI need a part-time job, like, ASAP.
What about working at a convenience store?\nI heard they're hiring.
A convenience store? I don't know if I could\nhandle that.
It can get a bit overwhelming, but it's nothing\nyou can't handle. I say go for it.
Have you heard?\nAnother new Menace appeared.
Really? What kind?
Apparently they'll show up and start going off whenever\nsomeone young sits in a priority seat.
Seriously?\nWho even cares?
You know Mr. Endo, the English teacher?\nHe always seems kinda bored.
Oh yeah, totally.
I'd rather have him than a teacher \nwho's just way too into it.
Plus, his class is surprisingly fun. He tells\nreally cool stories and stuff all the time.
Really? I had no idea. I always sleep, but\nmaybe I'll try listening for a change.
You know, lately I've been into gardening.
Gardening, huh? What are you growing?
Cherry tomatoes and edamame. It's actually\npretty fun.
Really? It does sound kind of relaxing. Maybe\nI should try it out myself...
Hey, guess what? I recently got\ninto cooking.
Is that so? That's great! Eating out all the\ntime hardly makes for a balanced diet.
Exactly! But now that I think about it,\nI've mostly been cooking meat...
Hm... Even then, it's good to be able to make\nwhatever what you want!
Oh yeah, doesn't that limited edition figure\ngo on sale tomorrow?
Yup. It's pretty popular, so you won't be able\nto get one without lining up early.
Think you'll take the day off to get one?
Nah, sounds like a pain. Besides, people just\nresell them right away.
Maybe I'll come back later...
I collected my pay.
I changed clothes and\nleft the store.
I need to pull\nmyself together...
I got my pay.
I'm pretty tired. Better hurry home...
Time to work the register...
The barcode is next to the\nprice on the back cover.
The barcode is next to the\nnutrition facts on the back.
I got paid for my work.
I was paid for my hours.
I started my new job at\nthe flower shop.
Right, time to sell\nsome flowers...
Tomoko and I will give it\nour all...
Tomoko dutifully served\ncustomers as I focused on\nwashing plates...
Time to roll up my sleeves...
I'll do my best on\nregister duty...
Got to give my full support\nfrom the kitchen...!
I went around the store\norganizing everything...
I sold flowers and helped\nthe owner around the shop.
I heard them muttering\nsomething about matcha\nbefore ordering...
The customer seems pleased!
The customer doesn't\nseem satisfied...
Perhaps they're searching for\nthat popular item the\nmanager mentioned...
The cr\xeape is ready\nfor toppings...
I said goodbye to Yamagoshi\nand went home...
I concentrated on\nwashing dishes...
I made some curry in\nthe kitchen...
I made the rounds in\nthe crowded shop...
Time to suds up...
Let's get cooking...
My head is spinning...!
I'm on register duty...
After work, I got changed\nand went home...
Antacids and energy drinks\nare on shelf 7...
Cold medicine is on shelf 1...
I handled the register...
Wow, they weren't kidding. It's quite busy!
Tomoko was right\u2014it's packed!
I worked the register while\nTomoko took care of\nthe shelves...
I helped organize the shelves...
The manager wasn't kidding,\nit's pretty busy...!
I handled the register while\nTomoko arranged the shelves.
Tomoko handled the customers\nwhile I continued sorting\nthe shelves.
Tomoko was right, it's\nincredibly busy!
I watched what others did and\nlearned as I went...
The manager believes in me\na little too much... I'll have\nto give it my all.
The potato croquette's\n160 yen and the roast pork\nis 900 yen, so...
I managed to make it\nthrough the day somehow...
It's as crowded as the\nmanager said. Time to\nbuckle down.
One beef croquette is 250 yen\nso five is...
One skewer is 220 yen,\nso six would be...
The food's selling like\nhot cakes...!
The scent of meat is clinging\nto my clothes. Better change\nand head home.
Back to business as usual...
The scent of meat is clinging\nto my clothes. Better change\nand head home...
I try to study at the diner...
The surrounding chatter\nis making it hard\nto focus...
I'll just keep going until I\nreach a good stopping point...
It's remarkably quiet...
I'm able to focus\nand get to work...
I wasn't able to get\nmuch done...
I can hear the rain\ndrizzling outside...
I was completely immersed\nin my studies!
Time to focus and\nstart studying...
With the soothing sound of\nrain in the background, I'm\nable to really focus!
I'll study at home...
I feel as though I've gained\nmore confidence in\nfacing enemies...
The temperature's perfect...
I can feel the hot water\nwarming me from\nthe inside out...
The bath is the perfect\ntemperature. I can feel all my\ntroubles melting away...
Today is a medicinal\nbath day...
The warm water\nsmells amazing...
I don't want to leave...
I can feel Lufel's\nintense enthusiasm...
I should be careful not\nto overdo it.
It looks like Victory Kitchen\nis holding an event...
There's a cash prize for\neating a giant bowl of ramen.
It says, "Big eaters, come try\nyour luck!"
Yikes, there's no shortage of\nnoodles or toppings...
Not to mention it's piping\nhot! How am I supposed\nto eat this!?
I finished somehow!
It's like a mountain\nof noodles and toppings...
I don't even know where start!
I finally finished it...!
The combination of rich broth\nand noodles... I've never\ntasted anything like this!
I keep eating and eating...\nyet it never seems to end...
It's just as enormous\nas ever...!
It says that solo singers\nare welcome...
An employee showed me to\na solo karaoke room.
I really sang\nmy heart out today.
I scored 60 points.
Perhaps we should\ncall it a day...
I enjoyed singing karaoke\non my own.
I scored 70 points.
I sang my heart out in a solo\nkaraoke room.
I scored 80 points!
I scored 90 points!
With the room all to myself,\nI sang up a storm at karaoke.
I did it! I scored 100 points!
I can't help but feel proud\nabout my singing...
I should pick up my prize\nbefore I leave...
I sang and sang until my time\nwas up.
The screen had a message about\na commemorative prize...
I sang all sorts of songs\nuntil my time was up.
This place is so calm and\nrelaxing.
Lufel's voice sounds distant.
My mind is strangely clear...
I think I'm starting to\nremember something...
That's right! I left some\nspare change in my bag...!
My heart feels lighter, and I\ncan think straight. I should\ncome back sometime...
My mind feels strangely clear\nwhen I come here...
I just remembered I've got\nspare change in my pocket...
My heart feels lighter, and I\ncan think straight. I should\ncome back sometime.
Where did I put that envelope\nmy parents left me?
I found it in the dresser and\nthen I left it somewhere...
The surrounding noise is\nfading away...
I suddenly thought of a way to\nuse the new math formula we\nlearned in class...!
I think it'll help me study for efficiently!
Everything I've been learning\nat school is starting to make\nsense now!
Everything is clear to me now!
That DVD I just watched of\n"The Ghost" really had\nme spooked...
I'm surrounded by silence...
My mind feels clearer\nthan usual.
Come to think of it,\nthat horror movie had a place\njust like this...
That's a scary thought...
I practiced crafting\ninfiltration tools in my head.
I figured out how to optimize\ncrafting infiltration tools.
I think my skills\nmight have improved...
Maybe I'll make my own tools\nto use in the garden...
My mind is swimming with\ngardening ideas!
I think my skills might have\ngreatly improved...
The flowers didn't look too\ngood when I left the house...
I'd better tend to them\nonce I get home.
I'll head straight to the\ngarden as soon as we get back.
Come to think of it, a cat\ncame to play in the garden\nthis morning.
Maybe I'll buy a cat toy...
Well then, let's take our leave.
The head priest's calm\ndemeanor has me thinking...
I wonder if I can grow up to\nbe a gentle and dignified\nadult too...
Perhaps we should call it a day.
Come to think of it, I saw\nsomething on TV the other day.
A show introduced ways to sit\nand stand with style.
Good posture is important.\nI'll keep it in mind.
The faint sound of music is\ncoming from inside...
People probably come here\nto enjoy music and have\na few drinks...
Looks like they're not\nopen yet...
I'll come back another time.
I steeled myself and drank it.
It packs a punch,\nbut it tastes amazing...!
It really is a pretty color.\nI wonder what's in it...
Bottoms up...
It tastes sweet yet mild.
The stimulating flavor gets\nmy mind running and keeps me\ncoming back for another sip...
I feel a growing thirst for\nknowledge...
It's a vibrant green drink...
It's a pretty, pink cocktail...
Here goes nothing...
It's slightly bitter yet\nsubtly sweet. The taste really\ngrows on me.
The slight bitterness brings\nout the sweetness...
I think I've discovered a new\nappreciation for drinks...
...!
It's sweet, sour, and...\ncomplex, but each note works\ntogether in perfect harmony.
I can't help but smile at the\ntaste of these strange\nnew flavors.
I ordered today's\nspecial drink...
It's surprisingly good!
Let's try it...
I coughed a bit at first, but\nit actually tastes\npretty mild...
I leisurely sipped my drink\nwhile imagining how it\nwas made...
Today's special is a\nrefreshing green drink...
Today's special is a\npretty, pink drink...
The owner prepared today's\nspecial drink...
The taste is growing on me...!
The drink has a strange mix\nof colors. I wonder what it\ntastes like...
I carefully bring the glass to\nmy lips for a taste...
You'd never guess by the way\nit looks, but the drink tastes\nmild yet complex...
I feel relaxed... I think I'll\ntake my time and stay\na bit longer...
Apparently this caf\xe9\nis quite popular...
I tried the owner's\nrecommended coffee blend...
It smells nice...
I feel like I've matured\na bit...
Taken by the aroma, I close\nmy eyes...
It's like I've been set free.\nI feel as though I've\ndiscovered something...
I was so absorbed in the\ncoffee that I dozed off...
Bewitched by the coffee's\nsweet aroma, I closed\nmy eyes without thinking...
Lufel sounds far away...
Wrapped in the comforts of\ncoffee, I feel like I've\ndiscovered something...
I accidentally nodded off...
I'll slowly savor my coffee\nbefore heading home...
I got to try a special blend\nthat was in the works.
I've never tasted anything\nlike this... The aroma is\nmaking my head spin...
As I drifted off to dreamland,\nI feel like I\ndiscovered something...
I closed my eyes for a second\nand accidentally fell asleep...
That was nice. I guess I\nshould start heading home...
A gym... Maybe I should check\none out the next time\nI'm in Shibuya...
It's a text from Mom.
Sounds like it'll be a\nlong vacation...
Come to think of it, no one's\ncleaned the house since\nthey left...
Guess it's up to me.
There's a nice caf\xe9...
No one seems to be inside...
It probably went\nout of business...
Good. Now get running!
This is our only chance!
Stay calm! You can get\naway now!
We'll retrieve the briefcase\non our end.
But I have to say, showing\nyourself above that crowd\nearlier was an excellent move.
Nice work as always, Joker.
Just run! Get out of there!
Okay, the enemy's focus is on\nhim. Looks like the rest of\nus can slip away.
Everyone remember where we're\nmeeting up?
No worries, I can guide\nyou all.
Over there!
Comparing power levels...\nNo threat. Get 'em, Joker!
Okay, pull out before their\nbackup gets here.
Nice one, Joker! Everything's\ngoing according to plan!
Huh? Wait... What happened to\nthe guys chasing you?
Wha... going...? ...Losing...\nsignal...
Joker...
The train will be arriving shortly. Please wait behind the yellow line.
There is a gap between the train and the platform. Please watch your step.
Okay, everyone. That's all for today. Pass your career questionnaires to the front.
Oh, and make sure to write your name on the top.
Not your nickname, not your social media handle. Your real name.
I just know it'll come back to bite me\nif I don't explain every little thing...
So please, don't forget to write your name!
*chuckle*
So, we meet again.
Welcome.
The place you find yourself now...
...is known as the Velvet Room.
I am Merope. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter.
You are familiar with the concept of "choice," are you not?
It is that knowledge by which you have become a guest in this realm.
Yes. I am referring, of course, to your choices.
Yes. We welcome you here as our guest.
And no, you are not unconscious, per se.
Indeed, looking upon the state of this place may cause you to conclude as much.
Consider this place a tunnel in a sea of souls, paving the way to the innermost depths of your heart.
This is where you have shown us your desire to understand...
...despite living in such a world. Well, let us leave it there for now.
Then, that brings us to the e\u2014 Oh, apologies. One last thing.
A lack of desire can lead to losing sight of yourself...
There are others like you in your world. My master wishes for you to keep this in mind.
Sorry to keep you. Until next time.
{NAME1}-kun, are you okay? You just spaced out.
You left the "future plans" part blank...
Arai-san, is everything all right?
Ah, Ms. Katayama...
Oh...
I assume all of you who left it blank simply have no plans for the future.
I'll hold onto this.
Looks like Ms. Katayama's in one of those moods again...
Okay, homeroom's over, everyone.
I understand some of you may be feeling completely powerless as the number of victims rises.
Maybe that's why so many of you are having trouble focusing lately...
Everyone, try your best to avoid being targeted. Your school uniforms make you stand out enough as it is...
That's all. Class dismissed.
You're bound to bump into someone if you're\nplaying with your phones while walking\ndown the hall!
Oh, {NAME1}-kun. Do you have a minute?
Off you go now. Be more careful next time, okay?
*sigh*
Sorry. I know class is already over, so I'll be quick.
About your career questionnaire...
Is there really nothing you want to do? Got any hopes for the future? Anything's fine.
Yes! That's the spirit.
......
I see...
I'll take that as "I have an idea, but I don't want to say."
Average? But you've still got your whole life ahead of you.
I guess we adults don't do a great job practicing what we preach.
Agh...!
...Yeah. I'm fine.
I should schedule in another shift after school...
Right, future plans! If you think of anything, let me know, okay?
Thank you for speaking with me. Get home safe.
Look! Another post about that creep pouring some unknown liquid on people.
Gross, there's a video? Damn, that's graphic...
Hang on, that's like a serious crime. Shouldn't someone report it to the police?
I don't know. It's kinda pointless,\ndon't you think?
Every time there's a Menace, the cops just\nthrow up their hands.
Would you girls mind moving this chat to the cafeteria?
No running in the halls.
Tanemura-senpai just spoke to us!
A student council member AND she's loaded! Tanemura-senpai's like something out of a manga! *sigh* She's so cool.
Ugh...
Are you okay? I noticed you having trouble passing through.
No need to thank me. Just doing my part.
I've seen lots of people acting self-involved\nlately. Being inconsiderate to the people\naround them and that kind of thing.
Don't forget that you can choose to stand up for yourself.
People have free will after all, so speak up and use it.
Sorry. I guess you didn't ask for my advice.
I'll be going then.
Hey, did you see that video?
Yes! That guy's such a creep! I really hope I never run into him.
It's only a matter of time till he's declared a Menace.
Come to think of it, I saw someone steal an\numbrella right out of the stand the other\nday. How's that for a Menace?
The train is leaving the station.
Hey!
*sigh* Just great...
Huh? What the hell!?
Someone's... up on the roof?
No way... Is she gonna jump?
Ah...
Well, from that height, she'll probably live.
I know how she feels. It's not like there's anything to live for.
Man, I wish I caught that on video.
So, even without "it," you still manage to question your own will?
Hoo hoo... I found you.
I knew you were the one.
We meet again, as promised.
I'll give you a piece of advice...
There is a difference between that which never existed, and that which simply can't be seen.
I sincerely hope that you are the latter.
I must say, of all the places to make an entrance, this isn't half bad.
If I squint really hard, you almost have a fierce look about you.
Hm, so you've come to.
Hm, that's a reasonable response.
It seems you still have hold of your curiosity. Heh, looks like finding you was worth the trouble.
I know your name... {PLAYER_NAME}, isn't it?
Hm? Do you not use names anymore?
How strange. And here I was sure I'd performed a perfect human introduction.
Well... no matter. You must still be\nconfused.
But we're losing time, so I'll keep the explanation brief.
Right now, you are not in the world you know. This realm is called the "Metaverse."
You might better understand it as "the collective unconscious," where the masses' innermost cognitions coalesce.
In the real world, hope continues to be lost...
That's why this world appears to be on the verge of a terrible and tragic collapse.
You losing your desire to know is just one example.
Humanity's hopes, desires, motivations... are being stolen out from under your noses.
Believe it or don't. It makes no difference to me.
The fact remains, your hope was stolen. But I will show you how to get it back.
Huh!?
Looks like they found us... Follow me.
We have to get out of here first. I'll explain the rest on the way.
Just come on. All you need to know right now is that I'm on your side.
What I said before, about humanity's hopes and desires being stolen...
You've sensed it yourself, haven't you?
When something goes wrong, you feel the urge to go against your instincts and throw in the towel.
It's easy to forget that "desire" can mean more\nthan greed or lust; it also fuels the will to live.
If someone gives up on all of their desires\nor has them stolen, what do you think would happen to that person?
You saw for yourself, didn't you? Someone who\ncould not hold onto hope, and so, let go of life.
Of course, this won't spell the end of the\nworld immediately, but...
Little by little, it will eat away at humanity,\nand inevitably lead to ruin.
And the source responsible for this is...
Tsk, so you plan to get in our way, huh?
They have no concept of morality. They attack\nhumans by nature.
But these aren't their true forms. They're\ninfluenced by someone powerful in the real world.
I wonder if they're also responsible for \ndraining the hopes from the crowd at the train station...
Indeed. These Shadows...
...are one part of how humanity's desires\nare being stolen.
For now, you should run!
No!
Is it possible that who you are now... is not the real you?
Something was stolen from you\u2014something that was meant to be yours, and yours alone.
Deception, loss...
You continue to reject your own free will.
Indeed. These Shadows are one part of how humanity's desires are being stolen.
How do you see yourself?
What will you do? You could end this story right here and now if you wanted to.
So, I will ask you this once...
To remain lost... let go of your future, and give up your life...
Do you accept this as your decision?
Yes! That's what I like to hear!
*gasp* You...
Let me see you break away from indifference by your own will.
You have chosen. Now make it so.
Disregard what you have been told. Do not be afraid, for if you can see it, you must seize it.
Could this be...?
Ahahahah! I thought this day might never come!
Henceforth we shall be bound, as my mighty belt ties us to our destiny!
The contract is formed.
I am thou...
That form... I can feel it... Its radiant, bursting zeal for life!
There's probably no need to ask, but are you ready to fight?
Heheheh, it's like you're a whole different person. Let's go!
The enemy's getting ready to attack. They'll be certainly out for blood.
If you want to live, you'd better put that weapon to use.
Use it to slice up the enemy!
What are you fighting for? Channel that desire into power... and unleash it!
Masterfully done. You hardly need my assistance.
Reinforcements, huh... If the battle drags on, it won't be in our favor. Time for a secret weapon.
Now, let your desires run free!
Looks like it's over...
It is what you just witnessed. That power.
It is the name your power has given itself.
A Persona is another self... A manifestation of your innermost desires.
In this cruel world, many struggle to see themselves clearly, and yet you...
Heheheh, it seems as if I've chosen well. You may just become this world's hope.
And if it wasn't clear, your stolen desires are right back where they belong.
Let us hurry onward.
I understand you must have many questions. But first, we need to get out of here.
If I die, there will be no one left to answer your questions anyway.
I'm glad you understand.
You can run, can't you?
That battle likely caught the attention of other enemies nearby. We had better hurry.
What terrible timing...
But I suppose now is as good a time as any. I'll show you the best way to knock down the enemy.
This is how you fight. Watch and learn.
Use that opening to strike again.
Seems like there's a big one headed this way. That must be what I was sensing earlier.
Oh would you just\u2014
...Fine. Between your Persona awakening and back-to-back battles, you must be feeling tired.
There you are.
Use that to heal when you're in a pinch. Let's move.
We're near the entrance.
The exit should be right here, but...
Wait!
I know you're there... If you're trying to hide,\nyou're not doing a very good job of it.
H-Hoo!?
No... it's not him. He's not the one I\nwas sensing.
But this area does seem to be linked to the source that stole your desire.
The Metaverse and the real world exist in parallel with each other. They're structurally linked, which means...
...there's someone in the real world whose desires are being exploited, and their will to live stolen from them.
Hm...? Looks like that struck a chord with you, huh?
This feeling... It appears we won't be able to take down this enemy easily.
Time to take on the mantle...
It's only fair to warn you.\nYou're up against two beings who've lost everything.
If you try to get in our way,\nwe will take everything from you...
...and color your defeat in crimson red!
Here's the pummeling I promised.
{NAME2}, I'll leave the finishing blow to you.
Heed your desires!
Nicely done.
That was quite the coup de grace. Your skill in battle's left me flabbergasted.
Flab-ber-gas-ted! It means, to be surprised!
Tell me, do present day humans no longer use\nsuch words? It would appear I must make\namendments to my body of knowledge.
If all goes well, I was hoping we'd come across them, but...
It seems we'll need to gather more information first.
However, witnessing the true scope of your\npower was quite the boon.
There's the exit. We'll talk in more detail\nonce we've safely made it out.
A Shadow!?
Hoom... I'm not sensing any hostility from it.
Much is still unknown about Shadows.
They come in many forms. Some are belligerent toward humans, while others may be agreeable.
They pillage the Metaverse, lured by strong desires even if they're from a human...
It's possible to convince them to surrender or negotiate a trade depending on the Shadow's own desires.
This one appears to just want to sell us\nsomething. Seems there are a few irrepressible\nentrepreneur types in the lot.
We can stop by when we have time.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but it'd be best for us to get going.
My thoughts exactly. I'm glad you understand.
Are you curious about your outfit change?
Allow me to explain. In the Metaverse, the strength of our desire causes...
Hey! Don't look at me like I'm a stranger. We just met each other's Personas a minute ago!
Yes. It's me, Lufel.
Tsk, I was just about to explain that, so if you don't mind...
*screech* I was getting to that! Don't interrupt.
Firstly, in the Metaverse your clothing changes to reflect the will of your desires.
In the event we're sensed by nearby enemies, we become sheathed in the armor of our hearts, so to speak.
Though, that's not to say I'm 100% certain of this. Some theories posit the armor is a symbol of one's rebellious spirit.
Anyhoo, that's the long and short of it.
Is that an owl?
City life sure has its surprises.
Apologies, but perhaps we should call it a day. I was hoping not to stand out this much.
Your intellectual curiosity is certainly admirable. But I think you've had enough for one day.
What with your Persona awakening and the previous battles, you ought to head home and rest.
Do not worry... We will surely meet again\nsoon. After all, I have a job to ask of you.
Before then, there's something I need to look\ninto. Once that's done, I'll come find you.
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!?
How did he get here...?
Hey, ever feel like you can't muster up interest in anything?
What did you put for your answer to the last question?
I couldn't think of anything, so I just wrote "N/A."
Same here. It doesn't really matter what we choose, anyway.
Honestly, I can't even bring myself to think about what to do after graduation...
I've got no idea what school I want to go to.
The school probably only cares about the advancement rate.
This way.
Jump down.
Let's keep going.
Almost there.
You certainly appear to have gotten the hang of battle. Keep it up now.
We don't have much time. Let's make quick work of them.
{NAME1}-kun?
Exploring this place any longer may put our lives at risk.
This is it, I'm sure of it. Let's go, Wonder.
I can hear something near the entrance. Stay vigilant and keep close to me!
That will get you nowhere. Try the other escalator instead.
We can't leave from here.
That's the wrong way.
That way's too dangerous.\nLet's leave it for now.
We've made good progress.\nWhy don't we take a seat and talk here?
We might be able to find a suitable\nworkbench in Yongen-Jaya...
A frontal assault would be difficult here.\nLet's search for another path of entry.
Wonder, follow me!
We should be able to sneak in to the Palace\nfrom here. Stick close to me!
Your Persona allows you to call upon\nfantastic power.
Ugh... That was quite a powerful blow...
It seems to be preparing a powerful attack.
We can't be careless here...
This is your chance!
Let us enter Mementos without being spotted.
Wait, there's a strange noise coming from the\nnext room...
We should check it out.
Careful, there's a Shadow ahead.
You'll find that being the one to initiate a\nbattle is to your advantage.
Try to catch Shadows off guard and get\nthe first strike!
This looks like a good spot.
Hide and strike while the enemy is unaware!\nThat's how a phantom thief should fight.
Now, let's conceal ourselves.
First time fishing here? Have fun!
Every day's a perfect day for fishing!
How about it? Wanna cast a line?
All righty, let's see what you got today!
A %d cm %s... That's %d points!
Ooh, you landed a rare one! That's double\npoints, so %d for this one.
Your current total is... %d points!
Wanna trade all of them in?
Well then, what now?
You need a %d yen ticket to fish here. Wanna\nbuy a ticket?
What's next?
You don't have enough money.
It seems you're out of bait.
Perhaps you should purchase more?
You again? What do you want?
Now we can set up a workbench here!
Try making a hook.
This is... a cognitive being.
If I can be an asset to the team, I'll rest easy.
Start by targeting their weak points!
Listen carefully!
The flying ones are weak to gunfire. Shoot\nthem down.
This Shadow looks formidable.
Search the Palace while avoiding fights\nwith Shadows.
This girl... Did she awaken?
Never a dull moment around you, Wonder!
I sense the presence of a special Shadow\nnearby... Keep an eye out for it.
It's a Treasure Demon! Defeat it, and its\ntreasure will be ours!
Let's proceed with hunting down our target.
I can sense danger in the area ahead...\nBut, with danger also comes treasure...
The area beyond this point is completely\nunder Kiuchi's control. It would be wise to\nproceed only when you're fully prepared.
It's your call, Wonder!
Sure!
Bringing it down may help us reach the next\narea, but be prepared for a tough fight!
Something isn't right... Let's go back to\nthat machine.
There seems to be something behind us. Maybe\nwe can use it to open the door?
There seem to be Shadows nearby.
There's nothing left here. Let's try\nsomewhere else.
Don't let your guard down just because the\nenemy is alone.
Indeed, in cases like this...
It seems the numbers are against us... Let's\nproceed with caution.
To take out all of our foes efficiently...
The enemies here are protected by some sort\nof ward.
Let's avoid direct confrontation until we\nknow more.
It doesn't look like we can sneak in here.\nLet's try elsewhere.
This isn't where we need to go right now.
We've uncovered a hidden area. Let's\ninvestigate.
You know I'm only using 50% of my power,\nright? This ain't even a warm-up for me!
Oh, I'm getting fired up now! Playtime is\nover for you kids.
I feel it! My power's building up!\nSay your prayers!
That's not an attack you want to take\nhead-on. You'd better guard this one.
Pardon the interruption.
I have arranged a mock battle to help you\nhone your skills. I would like you to try.
Please keep this in mind.
I will provide special phantom idols to\nhelp whip your combat know-how into shape.
Now if you don't mind, let us\nbegin the trial.
Let me commend you on a battle well fought.\nYour commands were undeniably splendid.
That will be all for this trial.
If you would like to try again, just find\nme in Mementos and ask.
Hoo... I hear a voice coming from the\ndepths of Mementos.
Some new entity may have appeared.
This may require investigation.
If we want to go further, we'll need to\ndefeat this one.
Be cautious. It feels powerful.
Hmm...?
Isn't that the peculiar-looking Shadow we\nsaw earlier?
Huh? Do you two know her?
We met her before you joined us...\nBut what's more curious is that machine there.\nWonder, perhaps we should investigate.
Howdy! So wonderful to see you again!
Did this ol' hunk o' junk here catch your\neye? Why don't ya come over here and take\na closer look?
I don't sense any malicious intent, but...\nwhat precisely is your objective here?
With so few customers about these days, I'd\nbe plum crazy not to take this opportunity!
Anyways, about this machine. I'll spill them\nbeans for ya.
Now take a good look at this beauty!
You'll find tickets scattered everywhere like\nleaves durin' fall, so make sure to collect\n'em. Good things happen to those who do.
Now go get yourselves a good heap of those\ntickets and try it out!
There're plenty of fare adjustment machines\nall around Mementos, so don't hold back!
This woman and her sales pitches... Clearly,\nwe have no use for this.
Well excuse me darlin', but it's not just me\nwho benefits from you using them machines.\nYou'd regret sitting this one out!
I see. Wonder, what do you think?
All right, I trust your judgment.
I don't really get what's going on here,\nbut I don't feel like she's out to cause\ntrouble for us.
Something's changed in Mementos, I can\nfeel it in the air. We should investigate.
Shall we go right now?
Good, let's make haste.
I'll be waiting here, then.
I do apologize for my uninvited arrival.
I have come to offer you a new service\nas your concierge.
Providing this service required a great\ndeal of research on my part.
Therefore, I created a limited-time-only\ntrial to give you greater motivation.
Please understand that this trial has been\nmade time-limited to improve your experience.
I would appreciate it if you would come\nas soon as possible.
Understood. I will be waiting for you in\nthe appointed place.
Ah, I see. In that case, I will wait here\nuntil you are ready.
Thank you for speaking with me. If you would\nallow me, I wish to propose a special plan\nthat I have devised for you.
I have prepared a trial space in which you\nmay battle powerful enemies... In other\nwords, a place for training your desire.
I would like to begin at once. Are you\nprepared to start?
Hmhm, a splendid display of desire.\nLet us begin.
Understood. Speak to me again when you\nare ready.
Hoo... So this is the strange area I sensed?
Do you remember what I told you about\nPalaces before the fight with Kiuchi?
It was... After we beat Kiuchi, the Palace\ndisappears. Cattle said it, right?
Oh! Then at some point the Palace\nmight show up again, right?
Yes. Now just as I predicted, the lingering\ncognition of Kiuchi's Palace lies ahead.
A "lingering cognition"...!? What the heck\ndoes that mean?
The ruler's Shadow is gone, but old memories\nand cognition may have restored it.
So Kiuchi's Palace is still here!?
Does that mean everything we did stealing\nthe treasure is just... undone now?
No, no need to worry. There's no sign of\nhis treasure here.
The cognition of the Palace itself...
I can sense the Palace ruler here too.\nLikely another cognition, but we should check.
3, 2, 1!\nKiuchi, Kiuchi, ace pitcher Kiuchi!
Let's go, Kiuchi!\nKiuchi the undefeated!
It seems like we can't get in now.
My apologies for appearing unannounced.
I have once again prepared a special trial.
Watch your health during difficult fights.\nYou mustn't neglect your healing!
We won't be able to continue here now...\nLet's settle things elsewhere.
Leader, I have a proposal to make...
Why don't we head back to Miyazawa's Palace\nand try exploring even deeper?
That may be so, but I'm not proposing this\nwithout good reason.
Firstly, the shadows will not anticipate\nus returning to the palace so soon after\nleaving.
I'd wager that if we went now, they would\nhave their guards down.
Secondly, the shadows will need time to reassemble their forces.
Thus, I believe there is no better time to\nact. What do you say, Leader?
Very good. Then off we go.
Very well... Then I shall be waiting here.\nDo let me know if you change your mind.
Hoom, we should be ready to complete that\ndeal with Marthym now!
Right! Ah, but there's still lots of tickets\nlying around. Shouldn't we pick 'em up?
I shall leave that decision up to Wonder.
There are still tickets lying around.
Wonder, could we discuss something?
Sorry about that.
I just realized I should tell you...
I've noticed something rather disquieting\nduring our recent explorations.
I had convinced myself it was just a Shadow,\nbut I've now realized what it truly is.
It's the presence of a Palace ruler. It's\ndifferent from before, but there's no doubt.
I don't know why such a presence would\nreappear, but we must investigate at once.
Hoohoo, I do value your decisiveness!\nLet's go, Wonder!
There's something else I need to tell you...
A new attraction just opened!\nWant to hear all about it?
The door here is locked. Let's search the\narea for anything unusual first.
That round hole in the middle... Something\nprobably goes in there.
Seems like that unlocked it... Let's check\nthat door from earlier.
Perhaps we could open this door by solving\nthe puzzle we saw earlier...
Use your environment to hide in enemy\nterritory! That's the way of a Phantom Thief.
Hoohoo, already putting it into practice!\nThat's our Wonder.
The door doesn't seem to open from\nthis side.
There should be a way around. Let's find it.
Looks like we can't open the door yet. Let's\nlook around the room first.
It seems we're unable to enter. Let's press\non for now.
A phantom thief must also know how to avoid\nunnecessary conflict. Be careful here!
Hoom! I sense a presense much stronger\nthan the other shadows... Be on your guard,\nWonder!
Wait, we should search the area for clues.
This looks like a specialized lock...\nPerhaps it needs to be disabled remotely?
Unauthorized access.
No response... Nothing we can do here now.
We were very nearly spotted just now!
This route is thick with Shadows.\nLet's find another way.
Hoohoo, well done, Wonder! I was right to\ntrust this to you.
The elevator is now operating.
The west exhibit hall is now open.
We can continue now.
Excellent, just as planned! This will grant\nus access to the closed-off areas.
We should take a good look around here.
Ah, this treasure chest is locked!
Don't worry. Locks like this are mere\nchild's play.
Welcome to Takeyuki Kiuchi's Baseball\nExhibition! Marvel at an incredible career!
Little league players dream of Koshien, and\nKiuchi-sama's performance there was\noutstanding!
In this room you can see the baseball gear\nKiuchi-sama treasured throughout high school.
Kiuchi-sama was truly an exceptionally hard\nworker through all his physical training...
He never neglected a day of practice!\nNow, how about a quiz?
That didn't work...
Of all this gear, which do you think\nKiuchi-sama replaced most often?
Looks like you got it right. Shall we\ncontinue?
Great! Looks like a match!
It seems we can't progress without answering\nthis question correctly.
The most frequently replaced gear... That\nwould be whichever wore out fastest, no?
Why don't we take a look through\nthe displays?
I'm not so sure this is it. I can't imagine\nit would wear out very quickly...
After his performance at Koshien, the great\nKiuchi-sama continued down the path\nto stardom...
Even as a rookie, he took the baseball world\nby storm!
Kiuchi-sama's Koshien performance earned him\nentrance to the major leagues...
And he started making waves in his first\nseason with his signature slider!
He quickly found a passionate fanbase.
Soon, he had his own merchandise!
Which merchandise did Kiuchi-sama see as his\n"pitcher's emblem"?
That went well! Keep it up, Wonder!
Now, how about a quiz? Of all this\nparaphernalia...
Another quiz? Irritating as it may be, we'll\nneed to answer if we want to continue.
A "pitcher's emblem..." Do you know what\nthat means, Wonder?
This doesn't look like a pitcher's emblem.\nLet's try something else.
Kiuchi-sama's team quickly rose through the\nranks and thoroughly crushed their rivals.
Let's turn to the score board for a moment\nand take a look at his marvelous record!
All of this is just about himself! Like he\nforgot it's his team that won, not just him.
During his time in the league, Kiuchi-sama\nwon the hearts of many fans. On that theme...
Can you tell us what set of merchandise best\nrepresents Kiuchi-sama as a star pitcher?
Impressive that you could figure that out\nwithout even being a Kiuchi fan, Wonder.
A test from Kiuchi-sama!
Nice work!
Yes!
Test failed. Such poor performance is\nunacceptable before the great Kiuchi-sama.
Looks like it was correct after all.
Oh yeah, I think the Shadow we saw earlier\nsaid something about guarding!
Hoom... Shall we try to observe the Shadow\nin question further?
Nice! We'll get that treasure in no time!
Symbols, huh...? Wasn't there something like\nthat on the monitor earlier?
Looks like this switch pauses the screen. If\nwe collect Kiuchi's symbols here, maybe...
Nicely done. Now, on to our next topic...
You failed before, but in his endless\ngenerosity, Kiuchi-sama will grant you\nanother chance.
This device controls the wall monitors.\nWe can't do anything with it yet, though.
Maybe if we watch how the screens change\nreeaally close, we can figure it out?
Hoom... I believe Closer is right, this\nrequires further observation.
Kiuchi-sama has received countless trophies.\nThe average man struggles for even one!
It seems we must collect 12 trophies.
Obtaining 12 trophies is a feat only\nKiuchi-sama is great enough to achieve!
For access to the guide, please consult\nthe administrative staff.
It seems like we got the order wrong.
F0r acCeSs to thththe guide, please cons-slt\nthe admini#%^ staff...
Hoom? This looks promising!
We have the order wrong. Hm, wasn't that\nShadow over there an administrator?
Hm, maybe we got the order wrong?
Configuration complete. Access to the guide\nis now restricted.
Hey, where are you going?
You know we can't go through the front\nentrance. We need a different way in.
Uh, what's this?
So we can just find out where the treasure\nis by looking at this?
It's not that simple, I'm afraid. This map\nshows only one section of the Palace.
Should've known it wouldn't be that easy...\nBut, we can use this to tell where we\nhaven't been yet, right?
Hoom, indeed. However... there are some areas\nthat we cannot reach. For now, let us keep\nmoving forward.
Oh, what is this?
Whoa, it's a card with Kiuchi on it!
We might be able to use this to get into\nareas we couldn't access before!
While exploring every nook and cranny\nof the Palace is important, stealing the\nTreasure is still our first priority.
But the elevator wasn't working...
No matter. If my suspicions are correct,\nwe just need to take this mechanism here...
And if we press this...
Wow, it worked!
Hoo hoo! Now, shall we board the elevator\nand head for the treasure?
The training area is currently closed.
You're the intruders? Well you're not getting\npast this base. Not with me to guard it!
We should be able to activate the elevator\nfrom the room ahead, but that Shadow looks\nrather formidable...
Looks pretty tough! Better get ready first.
Indeed. Better to form an attack plan before\napproaching it.
At Kiuchi-sama's recommendation, today's\nexercise will focus on core strength.
Please push the equipment box onto\nthe plate marked with the emblem.
Okay, that's that then!
Huh? I didn't say "do chores," I said to do\ncore training exercises!
Hey, wasn't that Kiuchi's voice just now?
There, you got some core training in, right?\nSo now you can help me with my routine!
...What? You've got your own training to do?
Sorry, but mine's higher priority! Yours\ndoesn't have the same "prospects," okay?
That TV anchor lady's here to interview me.\nIf I don't impress her, it'll ruin my image!
You get it now? Then hurry up and\ngive me a hand!
The base runner has been tagged out!\nPlease restart and try again.
Pushing the box around won't do anything.\nLet's look around the room some more.
It seems as though this door won't open...
Why is the middle of the display case empty?\nIt's like something's missing...
Do you think this case has something to do\nwith unlocking the door?
Perhaps we should try a different room.
Isn't this ball the same kind they had on\ndisplay in that case?
Hoom... Shall we go back and check?
I was right, it's the same ball! Let's put it\nin that suspiciously empty slot!
Team members who have finished their core\nexercises, proceed to the next exercise.
Good, it seems we can proceed now!
So we've risen in the ranks of Kiuchi's fan\nclub, huh? Can't say I'm exactly thrilled...
Still, having this card should grant us\naccess to further locations.
Wonder, let's keep an eye out for places to\nuse this card as we proceed.
Judging from the map, there's a lot of\nexercise equipment in this area.
Well, stadiums have spaces for the athletes\nto train in, so this must be one of those\nareas, right?
We saw a lot of stuff like this earlier, too.
Hoom, you're right. As with that training\nexercise earlier, who knows what awaits us?\nWe must proceed with caution.
Whoa, what are pitching machines doing here!?
A former pitcher, attacking people with\nbaseballs... How twisted.
No kidding... Those things fire balls at a\ncrazy speed. Getting hit by one would\nseriously hurt!
Indeed. We'll need to proceed with extreme\ncaution to avoid getting hit.
Hey, look! There's no fencing around that\nmachine!
You're right. We may be able to destroy it.
Yeah! Breaking it would make exploring\neasier, right?
We can either continue dodging the balls,\nor destroy the machine... It's up to\nyou, Wonder.
We can also proceed deeper into the palace.\nYour choice, Wonder.
Kiuchi-sama's exercise regime from hell\nreally wore me out today...
Senpai is just a reserve player, but he\nstill hasn't given up on becoming\nfirst-baseman!
He says you gotta work to be in the main\nlineup. Kiuchi-sama doesn't need weaklings!
I've gotta keep trying too...
Huh, the Shadows are competing with\neach other?
There's a closed area in the gym left of the\nelevator. Maybe that's where this senpai is.
If he's a reserve team member, maybe he'd\nappear if the regular first basemen is gone?
Wait, I hear a voice from that room...
Whoa, who are you!?
You're those devious intruders going\nafter Kiuchi-sama, aren't you?
Okay! I've set the trap, just like\nKiuchi-sama ordered.
Hey, who's that!?
You must be the intruders!
It looks like moving this box also moves that\npitching machine.
Look at the rail on the floor! You may be\nable to move the pitching machine with that.
We can't reach from here. Let's move the box\nso we can get it into the other room.
The equipment reset!? Hoom... It seems you\nhave to keep standing on it somehow.
Starting the Game Simulator. Follow the\ninstructions on screen to reenact the game.
Game reenactment inaccurate.\nYou have failed.
Success. Accept this trophy as a mark of your\nvictory.
According to the map, there should be a path\njust ahead... But it doesn't seem we can\nget through.
It looks too heavy for us to move...\nOh! Unless...
What is it, Closer?
Oh, well, I thought I saw some boxes we\ncould smash through back the way we came...
Maybe there's another way through!\nWanna check it out?
Hoom... It could be another way through.\nLet us proceed, then.
According to the map... This area is Kiuchi's\n"club."
The control room for this area is on the\nfirst floor. We can start the elevator there.
So we head there first?
This map has no details for the third floor.\nIt might not lead to anything, but...
But we always needed to start the elevator\nto make progress, right?
That is true. Wonder, let's go to the control\nroom first.
Hey, this mark on the door here... I can't\nreally make out what it is.
Hoomph... Perhaps that is deliberate.\nThey could be hiding something from those who\ndon't know its meaning.
You think we should go over there? But I\ndon't think we can get past the fence...
There's nothing to be done about that now.\nLet us think of a solution.
First, let's search the area, Wonder.
When you step here, the upper part reacts.\nSo if we keep an eye on that...
So we follow the hints on the floor, and that\nshould activate the mechanism.
It looks like a hint appeared over there.\nWe should check it out.
It looks like the red one is a trap.
So we want to avoid the red ones. Gotcha!
There's an enemy ahead. Watch out.
An electric fence... Security's getting\ntighter as we go, huh.
Kiuchi's becoming more wary, I expect.\nIt means we're getting closer to the treasure.
If the fence is electrified, there must be a\npower source somewhere...
So we just need to find the power and take it\nout. Let's look around here first.
Excellent, the power is cut. Shall we proceed?
Well, this is a larger area.
They've got the same traps here from before.\nWhy put them around an empty space?
Hrm, so taking out that box wasn't enough to\ntake out the power. We'll have to find more.
The hall's blocked off... Maybe there's\nanother way to get up there?
Excellent climbing!
There's a symbol on the plate by the door.\nIt's a... raised thumb gesture?
A thumbs-up, yeah. There's a light over there\nwith the same symbol on it.
Perhaps this means... Wonder, could you try\npushing that light for me?
As I thought, we need to push the door plate\nand the matching light in order!
Ah... What is it, Closer?
Kiuchi did this pose a lot when he was still\nplaying, right?
You know how the infielders gather on the\npitcher's mound when they need to strategize?
When they finish their huddle, they all\ndo this pose.
I guess he'd been doing it since high school.
I used to imitate it as a little kid, even.
Plenty of other kids did the same, too.
He took all those kids' admiration and shit\nall over it! I'll never forgive him, ever.
Yeah... Sorry, I was rambling. Let's go.
So it goes through this room...
There's an odd mark here too.\nLet's take a closer look.
Another one, really? That's even more places\nwe can enter now.
What's up with this room? Part of the floor's\nglowing red!
The glowing red part seems dangerous.\nBut what on earth was that just now?
I think it was some kind of... tag out? A\nglove-looking thing came out and...
What on earth is a tag out?
Uh... I'm not sure how to explain...\nYou tag a runner while holding the ball,\nand they're out?
A rule from baseball, then. So maybe it's an\nexpression of Kiuchi's attachment to baseball?
In any case, we need to reach the destination\nwhile avoiding the glowing red spots.
That's probably it. Watch where you step here,\nWonder!
You made it across. Excellent poise\nas always.
The cable passes through, but the door won't\nopen. Is that odd symbol the key?
I don't see any other exits.
Hang on, we may be able to return to the\nprevious hall via the air vents.
All right, another power line down!\nWe'll have 'em all out soon.
There's further to go still. Shall we\ninvestigate there too?
There was a light with the same symbol as\nthis door in that passage earlier.
This isn't the right place.
This door is locked. There may be a key\nsomewhere nearby.
There's room for another ball in this case.\nMaybe a pink or purple one?
We should be able to open that door now with\nthis ball. Let's go back and try it out.
Another light? Maybe this will open the\ninner door.
Kiuchi-sama! I've been waiting so long!
Huh!? Who are you!? Don't tell me you're those\nintruders that Kiuchi-sama warned us about!?
The same trap again. You can handle\nthis, Wonder!
Amazing as always, Wonder!
With this, the locked door should open.
There's a switch on the back here.
Now the electrified traps in the big hall\nshould be down. Let's go check.
Hmm... This floor seems far more difficult\nthan the others... Keep your wits about you,\nWonder!
Be careful, Wonder!
I admit I never imagined this hall's entire\nfloor could be a trap...
A passage? Here?
Hoo... We've barely had time to catch our\nbreath so far. A break is in order.
If there are Shadows here, that means they're\nguarding something valuable, right?
Wonder, to battle!
I think assigning tiers to your own fans is\npretty gross, to be honest.
We're making good progress toward the\ntreasure. Let's stay focused!
Yeah! Whatever Kiuchi's twisted desires are,\nwe've got to steal them away!
I think we just have to push this on the\ncontrol panels and then...
Everyone, gather at the playing field!\nKiuchi-sama's exhibition match will\nsoon begin!
An exhibition match? Whatever that means, it\nsounds like Kiuchi is at center field.
S-Tier? That sounds like it should be\nthe highest rank.
We're close to totally conquering\nthis palace, right?
The treasure is within our grasp... But there\nare some areas we haven't explored yet.
If we want to be as thorough as possible, we\ncould go there first. It's up to Wonder.
Howdy there! Have you ever wanted to\ntry fishing?
Go check it out sometime! You'll have a\nreel-y great time!
Are you into working up a sweat? Swinging a\nbat? Making balls fly? All of the above!?
You should go and give it a try for sure!\nYou'll have a ball!
Howdy there! Do you like capsule toys?
You can find them in the capsule machines\nright here in Shibuya, so be on the lookout!
You can put 'em on display, carry 'em around,\nanything you want! Woof-woof!
Something seems to be changing in the\nMetaverse...
What's wrong, Cattle? Something on your mind?
Ah, no... It's nothing important, but...
Well, as you're fully aware...
In the Metaverse, the threat of Shadows\nmeans we're constantly looking over\nour shoulders.
I just wish we had a safe spot to enjoy\nleisurely conversations in the Metaverse.\nLike Wonder's house in the real world.
That does sound nice... but a place like\nthat's gonna be super hard to find.
Quite. One doesn't just stumble upon such\nhidden treasures so conveniently...
Well, it seems like someone could benefit\nfrom some assistance!
Ah, it's you!
I didn't come here to sell anything, silly.\nI came to offer you some humble guidance!
What do you mean?
I shall explain everything you need to know...\nwhen we get there!
Today, my lovely customers, I would like to\nintroduce you to... the Companio!
Companio...? What does that even mean? Um...\nwhat should we do, Wonder?
If you say so, then very well. But we should\nremain cautious.
Where are we?
This here is the main area of the Companio!
I care little for what it's called. The\nquestion is... what exactly is this place?
We are standing in a crevasse between the\npast and present. Where the wills of the\nmasses surge and flow...
In simpler terms, a lot of strange things\nhappen here!
Strange things, you say? Hmm...
I'm not sensing any danger from this...\nCompanio. Am I correct in thinking you are\noffering this place to us?
Indeed I am! Here, take this. It's all the\nfine print!
By the by, there are certain items that can\nonly be found here.
Helpin' me collect 'em would certainly be\none way of repayin' the favor...
So that's your motive for bringing us here.\nA shrewd business plan indeed.
But, I think we've found ourselves a rather\ndecent base in the Metaverse...
We should discuss this before we make a\ndecision. Could you give us a moment?
Why, of course!
We'll head back to Mementos for now, then.
Come back anytime!
All right... Now, let's hear both of your\nthoughts on this.
Why not give it a shot? The "strange things\nhappen there" aspect of it is kinda spooky,\nbut otherwise, it sounds kinda fun!
Hoom, while I'm not against it, I don't think\nwe should be making this decision lightly...
In that case, maybe Wonder should make the\ncall. He's the leader after all.
I suppose so... All right then. What we do is\nup to you.
Perfect timing, {NAME2}! I was hoping\nI'd bump into you!
I was wondering if I could ask you for\na favor...
I knew I could count on you!
Okay, so the band club is looking for an\nextra member.
But I'm not really in a position to help them...\nso I was wondering if you might be\nable to help them instead!
Oh, no need to worry about that! The club's\nvice president is Ritsuka Takanashi...
...and she'll teach you everything from\nscratch! So do you think you could help 'em\nout!? Promise to treat you to a burger!
Oh, and there should be a post for band club\non the club bulletin board with more details,\nso be sure to check it out!
Oh, you must be {NAME1}, right?\nMotoha told me about you.
I'm really sorry for the sudden request.\nIf there's ever anything you're unsure about,\nfeel free to ask me anytime.
Okay, how about you play something for me to\nstart off with? That way, I can come up with\na suitable practice routine for you!
No need to to be shy. Music's all about\nhaving fun!
Oh, perfect timing, {NAME2}! Guess what?
I've got just the perfect workout plan\nfor you! Wanna hear it?
I was hoping you'd say that!
Then without further ado, allow me to\nintroduce... the soccer team captain,\nYota Kurosawa-kun!
So you're {NAME1}, huh? Arai was telling me\nabout you!
You seem to be in pretty good shape,\njust like she said! Sharp eyes, too!
Ahaha, as you can see, Kurosawa-kun here's\na pretty energetic guy.
It's all thanks to soccer! It doesn't just\nstrengthen your leg muscles, but your\nheart, too...
Hang on, let's back up a sec. We haven't\neven explained the situation to\n{NAME2} yet!
Oop, sorry!
So Kurosawa-kun told me that one of the\nmembers of the soccer team was injured and\ncan't play anymore...
He said that they're looking for another player,\nand I was wondering if you might be\ninterested.
I bet soccer training would make the perfect\nworkout plan for our operations.
Haha, well, we've all gotta start somewhere,\nright? Don't worry! As captain, I'll support\nyou every step of the way!
Hey, don't sell yourself short! I bet you'll\nlove soccer if you just give it a shot!
Good luck, {NAME2}. I'll be cheerin'\nfor ya!
Do you remember that ominous-looking door in\nthe Companio?
Nightmare's Gateway... was it? I don't know\nwhy, but it worries me.
I'd like to check it out. My apologies, but\nlet's head to the Companio.
Oh, you're back! Impeccable timin'!
I've been startin' to feel somethin' real\nsinister from beyond Nightmare's Gateway.
If things keep goin' like this, I reckon\nwe're headed for a whole heap of trouble...
I see... So my fears were not unfounded.
So, you want us to defeat whatever is on\nthe other side then?
Oh, I'm so glad we're on the same page!
There'll be a marvelous reward awaitin' your\nreturn... if you succeed!
Always meaning business, I see. There is\nmuch to be gained, but not without risk.\nWhat should we do, Wonder?
Great! I just knew you'd say yes!
Then we have a deal. Let us prepare, and\nthen crack open this Nightmare's Gateway.
Hey, are you interested in joining the\nband club?
Being in a band's the best. Nothing beats\nperforming with your buds, and seeing the\ncrowd go wild...
If you are interested, you've really gotta\ntry it. You're bound to love it!
Oh hey, are you interested in joining the\nsoccer team?
Soccer's the most beloved sport in the world!\nThere's nothing like passing the ball at the\nperfect moment and scoring a goal!
If you do have an interest, I urge you to\ngive it a shot. We welcome new members\nwith open arms!
Join us as we aim for nationals!
So, sugar, how are you finding the place?\nYou seem like you're having fun here.
Glad to hear it, glad to hear it! Can't be\nmuch of a merchant without satisfied\ncustomers, now, can I!?
Come visit as much as you like, whenever you\nlike! You're always welcome here!
Every so often, we'll get something extra\nspecial in stock at the shop here, so look\nforward to that!
Hmm... It doesn't seem as though this door\nis going to open. Let's look around a little\nmore and see what we can find, Wonder.
Good work, Wonder. Keep it up.
It seems we'll need a key to open it up...\nLet's search the area, shall we?
Hmm...? I think that might have changed\nsomething...
It seems that this door still won't open...
Hmm... Perhaps there is something that we\nstill need to do, Wonder.
Are we perhaps forgetting something, Wonder?
I sense something on the other side of\nthat gate...
Hmm, did you hear that...? I think that's\nunlocked it, Wonder.
It seems that we cannot use the camera...
We'll need flint in order to light the flame.\nI wonder where we could find some...
Is there not something else that we need\nto do right now?
Wait. Let's defeat the shadow near the\ntreasure chest before we open it.
It would seem that was the wrong order...\nPerhaps you could use your skills of\nperception to uncover a hint.
Hmm, there's another camera here...
What's this...? Might it have something to do\nwith that camera...?
Hmm, it seems that we can use this camera.
Hmm... This camera appears to be slightly\ndifferent.
There seems to be a row of torches here...
There's something slightly different about\nthis torch...
What a peculiarly-shaped device...
I've spotted another camera.
Cameras here, too? There's something off\nabout this.
But it's not movin'... Is it broken?
Long, long ago... Four self-proclaimed "true"\nshinobi challenged the great\nCastle Miyazawa.
What... Is that Miyazawa's voice?
Brave samurai and countless automata await\nthem! Few will return alive!
With trained eyes and skills, can the shinobi\nconquer the castle and reclaim their honor?
A new masterpiece written, directed, and\nstarring Hiromu Miyazawa, in theaters now!
Four shinobi? Does that mean... us?
Probably, yeah. Which would mean that\n"Castle Miyazawa" is...
Indeed... We've seen palaces take different\nforms, but this one sounds like a movie pitch.
So it's Miyazawa's idea for a movie, then.\nHe did say something about a script...
Wait, does that mean we have to actually\nfollow his script to go through the palace!?
However, it isn't usable right now.\nShall we investigate the area first?
No getting through here. There's a big box in\nthe way.
Oh, look over there! There's something\nby the camera.
What is that thing? Doesn't look like it's\njust for decoration...
The shinobi foolishly entered Miyazawa Castle\nstill proclaiming their own truth...
Dun dun dun! Hunt for the Shinobi:\nthe Impregnable Automata Fortress!
Is that supposed to be a movie title? It's...\nUh, I'm not sure about that one, man...
Soon, the first automata block their path.
Nothing but cheap shots from this guy...\nI'm not falling for it.
I get what you mean, but the problem is, what\ndo we actually do now?
Very sharp, Wonder. I was thinking about that\npart myself.
That thing Closer spotted may be a hint. We\nshould at least take a closer look.
Is that what he meant by transformation?\nI guess it changed shape, but come on.
Usually "powers of transformation" would mean\ntransforming yourself, right?
Right! He's really phoning this shit in,\nain't he?
The gate's not opening... Is it locked or\nsomethin'?
Oh! Look, there's a camera over there, too.\nIt looks different from the others.
Having passed the first trial, the shinobi\nwere faced with a second trial!
Only the shinobi's Eyes of Truth technique\nhad any hope of overcoming this automata...
Delinquent brats who rely only on brute force\nshall weep! For they are powerless!
Ugh... I know he's trying to get to me, but\nit still pisses me off!
He mentioned Eyes of Truth... You think that\nhas anything to do with that camera?
Miyazawa does seem to have a strong attachment\nto film and cameras.
It's not clear what he means by Eyes of Truth,\nbut we can go ahead and test some theories.
The gate's clear now! We can keep going!
That's great and all, but... is this really\na ninja technique?
Right!? Ninja arts, Eyes of Truth, all this\ncrap is just a way to stretch his\nshoddy premise...
Huh? It's a dead end?
There's another camera. Which must mean...
Battered and bruised, the shinobi forged on,\nonly to find themselves facing a new trial...
I knew it!
A seal? Whatever that means, I'm sure it'll\nhave to do with cameras again.
Indeed... Time for more trial and error, then.\nGood luck, Wonder.
Okay, what kind of "seal" opens just by\npointing a camera at it?
Maybe this is supposed to be ninjutsu, too?\nI think I'm losing the plot now, though...
Don't worry, Closer. It's probably better not\nto think about it too much.
Now he's blocking the way with bales of rice?\nMan, these'll be a pain to move...
It's been consistent so far, but really, how\nare we supposed to apply a camera here?
My cunning little burglars, I see you've made\nit into the heart of my fortress...
For delinquent children you've done well...\nHowever! You will go no further!
Cursed Eye of Time, huh? And it's a "demonic\nart" this time?
Sounds like it. Guess he realized the "ninja\ntechniques" thing wasn't gonna cut it this time?
I know you all have critiques to make, but\nwe're not here to workshop Miyazawa's script.
Right now we need to figure out what this\n"Cursed Eye of Time" really is.
You're right. I guess we should go check\nout the camera.
So it... rewinds time? Wow, these cameras can\nreally do anything...
No kidding. Maybe the next one'll transport\nus to another dimension?
We're in an alternate dimension right now,\nyou know...
Oh!
Another camera... But we can't get to it,\nhuh.
We'll have to do something about the fence.\nMaybe those lantern things do something?
Dun dun dun... Our cocky little brats refused\nto learn their lesson and kept going...
They will never be able to discern the true\npattern! Struggle and despair! Ahahaha!
Uh, I think he's breaking character now...
He didn't even mention ninjas once\nthis time.
Agreed. But even if his script is a joke,\nhis automata are not...
We should examine this place carefully. We may\nfind some hint about the pattern we need.
Aw yeah, we got it! Miyazawa said it was\nimpossible, but that wasn't so bad!
Indeed. Well done, team.
What!? How could they complete this trial so\neasily? My whole script is ruined now!
Don't think this means you've won, brats!\nThe story's not over yet!
What's he got up his sleeve this time?
Who knows... Whatever it is, it doesn't\nchange what we've gotta do, right?
Yeah. Still though... That last line from him\nsure was a clich\xe9 villain quip, huh.
This "movie" has a D-list ham for a lead\nactor on top of a garbage script... What a\nhack job.
I really must agree...
Hey, is that a map of the palace?
Seems we're in the Third Bailey from the\nlooks of it.
In order to infiltrate the palace, it is\ncrucial that we grasp its layout. Be sure\nto check the map as we proceed.
Ah, there's another map!
Looks like we're in the Second Bailey...\nHey, wait a sec, this place's even bigger than\nthe Third Bailey!
Guess we've still got a long road ahead of\nus... Well, no use complaining. Let's keep\nmoving!
I spy a map! Let's see here...
Hmm... This castle seems rather\nlabyrinthine...
Let's proceed carefully so we don't get lost.
Hey, found another map.
Jeez, does it really need all these\npassageways!? And it looks like there's\nobstacles round every corner...!
Indeed, it does seem dangerous, but I sense\nthat we are getting closer to the Treasure.\nWe have made good progress.
This must be the final map... The Treasure is\nwithin our grasp.
Yeah, but this area seems like it's gonna\nbe a real pain to get through. Looks like\nthere's even more obstacles...
This place has a different vibe to the rest\nof the castle, so this has to be the final\nstretch. Let's do this!
If I may speak, you appear ready to\nface a trial.
Here, you may see what I have prepared.
Ah, it's time.
Looks like you've found a real prize!
Success!
This Shadow can't support the Palace ruler\nanymore...
Let's have it assist us now!
It seems we've been sent somewhere\noutside Mementos...
I sense a large number of Shadows here.\nLet's proceed with caution.
Wonder, wait. I sense intense malice here.\nBe careful.
So you're the little rats who snuck into my\ncastle. Have you come for my head?
If you have any sense at all, you'll turn\ntail and flee this place!
Much as I hate to grant credence to enemy\ntaunts, what he said is true.
It would be unwise to challenge him now.
But we're not without recourse! The Shadow\nhimself gave us the hint we need.
He said that the loyalty of his vassals is\nprotecting him.
Loyal vassals...
How about we start by looking for Shadows\nthat fit that description?
I am an honorable warrior! I will not yield\nto the likes of you!
Good, we've removed that Shadow's protection\nfrom the lord shadow.
Let me out! Damn you! I'll win the next\nfight. Just you wait!
Say, Wonder, have you noticed that we can\nsteal these Shadows' powers?
They seem to have a variety of abilities.\nThey may be quite useful if we're smart\nwith them.
Another enemy! Let's take it out!
Let's use this power.
Ugh... They must have sealed the doors to\nprevent us from stealing more of their power.
We won't be able to fight any more of\nthe vassal Shadows...
But...
Come and challenge me if you dare, cowards!
The underlings are already captured, so we\ncan't fight the them anymore.
There are Shadows lurking around here\nsomewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
This is a strong one, but if we can fight and\ntake out its underlings, we'll stand a chance!
Excuse me.
I have been sent to inform you that the time\nhas come for you to make a deal.
*chuckle* I look forward to your next visit.
You can obtain new power...
Use its power well...
May we meet again soon.
We can't go in here now it seems.
Hoom... We can't go in here. Let's try again\nanother time.
I'm not a Shadow here, ho! I live in\nthe sea of the hee-human heart!
I'm no Shadow from this place. I used to be\nlivin' in that there sea of the human soul!
I see... So it was my destiny to find\nmyself within you!
You know, I'm not really a Shadow!\nI came from the humans' sea of souls!
In truth, I am not a Shadow. I originated\nfrom the humans' sea of souls...
I'm not the same as those Shadows\naround here. I came from the sea of\nthe human soul!
I am not a Shadow of this place...\nI've resided within the sea of the\nhuman soul since ancient times...
Me am not a Shadow that belongs here.\nMe exist in the sea of souls of humans!
I'm not actually a Shadow. I... have existed\nin the sea of souls with humanity for all\ntime...
I'm so not a Shadow that belongs here.\nI used to be in the humans' sea of souls...
I'm not a Shadow that lives here! I'm\nfrom the sea of souls of you humans!
...I'm so not a Shadow that belongs here.\nI used to be in the humans' sea of souls.
Looking forward to working with you, ho!
As thanks for awakening me, allow me to\nfill your days with love and war...
Your soul shall burn a brilliant crimson with\nmy hellfire.
Nice to mee-heet you, ho!
With a single blow from my hammer, I will\npummel your enemies into the ground...
I'll pop out whenever your spirit\ncalls, mister!
Nice to meet you... Or so I'd say, but you\nkinda rub me the wrong way.
Good day to you. Now come, a feast\nawaits us.
Allow me to teach you the fundamentals\nof magic...
Any who oppose us shall be singed by the\nflames of vengeance...
Your battlefield is my banquet hall!
Starting today, I'm all yours...
My magic spear shall bring a rain of\nblood. Now, let me be your mask!
The holy power to strike down the darkness\nnow lies within you.
I now declare the birth of your\nnewfound power...
From this day, you are my retainer, ho!\nServe me-hee well, ho!
In the name of the light within you,\nI shall become your mask.
I wish to accompany you... No matter\nhow far... No matter how long...
Have no fear. I will be the force that leads\nto your awakening...
Me not forgive your enemies...
Let's awaken the power resting within you...
Perhaps I'll teach you the steps to the\ndark waltz...
I'll leave the realm of dreams for a while\nand look after you.
Your prayers grant me strength. Come, let us\nfight together.
This melody of the heart... It is for you...
Want to know how I died? Heehee, maybe\nI'll tell you if I become your mask...
Me no like unclean thing. Good meet you...
I see you know of my ingenious feats.\nRejoice, for I shall graciously become\nyour mask...
Come, let the training of your mind begin...
I will gladly sacrifice my body to help\nyou. If it brings you glory, a new mask\nI shall become.
As your other self, I shall come to\nyour aid...
The burning light that illuminates the\nfuture is now your new mask...
Spin and spin, the thread of fate...\nI am the mask which can see your past...
Your future shines bright like a fish's\nbrilliant scales! I shall be your mask now.
I shall bring help to your marvelous soul.
Let us walk through this desert world\ntogether. Now, I shall become your mask.
My sword, my bow... These tools which\nformed this fine land shall now grant\nyou power as a mask.
Mine roar causeth all beasts to bow down!\nI shall be thy mask!
I'll be your mask from now on! Let's fly\ntogether into the light!
That's enough staring... It is time I become\nyour mask and teach you my joy-bringing\ndance...
The might to move all creation shall\nnow become thy mask.
So you wish for the power to kill, even\nif others abhor you? In that case, I shall\nbecome your mask.
Woohoo! It's me, man! The one from your heart!
I've got your back, mister!
I'm coming with you, so let's have some fun!
If you burn for revenge, I will gladly\nfulfill that desire...
I come from within you to fight for you...
Have you been a bad boy? Let's play!
What be my madness also be your power...
Maintaining the universe, crushing evil...\nI am the manifestation of thine heart,\nthine invincible mask.
This infinite well of power... which can\nswallow the universe... shall become\nyour mask...
You know the deadly flower blooming in\nyour heart? That's me!
How about we get up to a little mischief!?
I'll howl at all your enemies!
I'll flutter straight out of your heart!
To repay your feelings of love, I'll do my\nbest for you... *giggle*
I am the true master of all winged beasts...\nand so, I shall become a mask and bestow\npeace upon thee...
Peace and security are my duties...\nI shall be your mask and grant you my power!
Now, come\u2014let us rejoice in the melody that\ndraws forth true might.
The thread of fate is measured by my hand...\nI am the mask which determines your future...
My power to encourage growth in all who\nworship me shall become a mask and protect\nyour soul...
I am the one who reflects\nyour rebellious spirit.
Hatred and violence are the best,\ndon't you think? Wear my mask and\nlet's kick it on over to hell!
I wish good fortune upon thee.
As long as I'm with you, good fortune is\nsure to follow!
Allow me to take care of your heart.
As thanks for awakening me, I shall\nserve you.
Let's try not to get ourselves hurt, eh?
I'll agree to be your new mask, so don't work\nme THAT hard, y'hear!?
Even if things get spicy, let's do our\nbest, mister!
From here on out, I'll temper your very soul!
I'll show you the truth of the future\nyou want.
Allow me to accompany you from now on.
...Me mysterious. Nice meet you.
I will grant you the power of an\nunyielding heart...
You have roused me from my deep slumber\nwithin you.
You summon me? Me... excited...!
Let's sit and think about who\nyou really are...
Me guide you through other world...
Allow me to strum out the true emotions\nof your heart.
I'm gonna echo inside your heart, bro...\nWahooooo!
Don't worry, everything'll work out!
As long as you remain fearless, I shall grant\nyou my power...
Overflowing power has joined you...
I'm bringing you along to the party\nof destruction!
I'll give you some good dreams tonight!
As an indomitable force, I will protect you.
Let's ascend to new heights together...

These one hundred hands which have\nemerged victorious in countless wars\nare now held within your mask!
I bestow upon thine mask a strength which\ncan conjoin the heavens and the earth.
Gaze upon the radiant light and somber\ndarkness within me!
I can sense the desire throbbing within you!
It is time to release the rage buried within\nthis desecrated soul...!
This body of mine, born from the bloody\nthroes of battle, shall be with you as a mask\nfrom now on.
I bring fertility, and shall lead you to the\nfuture. This fruitful body shall now be\nyour mask.
Through my mask, you shall burn the\npower of my world-consuming flames into\nyour eyes...
With our powers combined, we have nothing\nto fear...
I shall serve you from the depths of\nyour heart.
I'm your heart's undying justice!
I shall raise your heart to the highest\ncelestial plateau.
You with the body immune to rot... Let us\nwelcome the impending day of salvation\ntogether as one...
In this world between logic and insanity,\nI will be your guide.

Perhaps together, we can solve the riddle\nof love and beauty...
You there! Lemme make that power of your\nheart burn!

I'll bring some vigor back to your body.\nCome on, let's check out the mysterious\nnature of this world!
Good evening.
Yes. Please address me by that name when you\nare in need of my assistance.
Correct. You have visited this place\nonce before.
And from here on shall visit countless\ntimes more.
You are currently resting in your home.
My apologies for disturbing your sleep.\nMy master wishes to impart a message.
I must issue you an urgent warning.
First and foremost, allow me to convey\nmy gratitude.
You have shown me new potential.
Curious, are you? *chuckle* Very well.
You needn't feel so apprehensive about\naccepting my gratitude.
You have demonstrated incredible potential\nthrough your innate, indelible fervor\nfor life.
A sentiment all humans should naturally\npossess, yet the most oft forgotten\nfundamental desire.
Your overflowing vitality, it reaches beyond\nyourself and spreads to those around you...
...causing their forgotten desires to\nawaken. This is the gift you hold.
Hence, I am saddened by the prospect of\nhaving to bid you farewell someday.
As I said, this is a warning.
However, your vitality, your influence...
...may forge hope through interaction with\nother embracers of desire.
You have already proven this to be true.
*chuckle* There is no need for you to\nunderstand just yet.
However, if you find ruin an unsavory fate...
...you would do best to seek other allies of\nhope, and nurture the desire within\nyour heart.
With that... Merope, please offer our guest\nyour support. You understand your\nassignment, yes?
That is all for this evening.
We look forward to seeing you again.\n*chuckle*
Good morning.
Hoohm, greetings. You're quite congenial for\nthe morning. Sorry to pester you first thing,\nbut I have something to report.
It seems your desire to know takes\nprecedence over social niceties.
Hoohoo, perhaps that's a good sign. Your\nPersona has only just awakened, after all.
Now, I will answer all of your questions as\npromised. Then I would like to speak in more\ndetail about the job I have for you.
That alarm indicates that the time for your\nattendance at school is drawing closer, yes?
Given your responsibilities as a student, I\nwould be remiss to inhibit your desire\nto learn...
In that case... Hoomm... I will drop by the\nschool during your midday comestible period.
Wha\u2014!? You don't understand?
Comestibles are food. I am referring to your\nafternoon meal break. Do humans no longer\nuse that word...?
Well... No matter. We are business partners\nnow. Let's do our best to understand each\nother better.
I plan to explain in greater depth during\nthe comestible hour, but...
Your performance yesterday was exceptional.\nFurthermore, I sense strong potential\nwithin you.
You may deliver this world from fading hope\nto salvation... Or perhaps to devastation\ninstead.
Nonetheless, I have the utmost faith in you.
That being said, the state of your room\nleaves much to be desired.
Apologies for cutting things short, but\nthere is someone I must keep a close watch on.\nLet us meet again at school.
...Is that you, {NAME2}-chan?
Oh my! It is you!
Listen to you, sounding all grown up\nand everything.
And look how handsome you've become!
I'm your neighbor. Wow, you've really grown\nup since the last time I saw you. I've seen\nyour mom a few times here and there.
Oh, speaking of... aren't your folks out of\nthe country for a while?
Don't forget: I'm still... I'm still "Tomi\nfrom the Block." You can call me any time\nyou need something!
Ahaha, I suppose I've dated myself with\nthat reference, haven't I...?
It is, huh!?
It's pretty unique, being so... safari-esque?\nThat collar and all the pockets give\nit away.
I can't believe the design hasn't changed a\nbit since I was your age.
I remember when my hubby and I were in\nhigh school...
Whenever he had a practice match, I'd be\nthere first thing, bentos in hand, ready to\ncheer him on!
Once I even went to a match of his in\nShibuya! For that one I think I took... Was it\nthe Inogami Line to Shimo-Kitazawa?
Oh dear, I've got to get my hubby's\nbreakfast started. See you later, hon!
The power... of the Persona...
Following the procedure imparted to me...\nTwo to form one anew... Two to form one...
Duo!
I will put it to the test.
That guy over there...
OMG, he's suuuper hot...
Ikenami-kun, you are a sight for sore eyes.
Don't be so loud! He'll hear you.
Oh right. Gotta be careful or I might end up\na Menace.
The next station is Shimo-Kitazawa. The exit\nwill be on...
Ah!
S-Sorry!
Uhh...
The doors are closing.
Huh? Oh no!
You're kidding! I dropped my train pass!?
Daaargh! What're you doing!?
Hurry up...
I-I'm sorry!
What do I do now? Where did I...
Huh!? Oh, you're the guy from before...\nMy train pass!
Thank you so much!
This keychain is really important to me.\nI don't know what I would've done\nif I'd lost it...
Sorry about before... I was so disoriented I\ndidn't even say thank you.
That uniform... Is that for Kokatsu Academy?
I knew it! I thought I'd seen you before in\nthe second-year's hallway.
Hehe. You're a terrible liar. I'm sure I've\nseen you before in the second-year's\nhallway.
Guess that means we're in the same grade!
Ah! I've gotta hurry! I'm supposed to help\nset up the classroom before first period...
Sorry for being so frantic. Thanks for\nyour help!
All right, let's get started with today's\nmath lesson.
You all look like you're running on empty...
That's fine. We can start today's class in\npower saving mode. In that case...
{NAME1}-kun. I saw you first, so why don't\nyou try to answer this question for me.
A metaphor to illustrate how one's actions\ncan impact others negatively compares a\nperson to which rotting fruit?
Unfortunately, the correct answer is apple.
Though scientifically, the principle applies\nto various kinds of produce.
Yes, well done. The answer is apple.
One bad apple spoils the whole barrel, as\nthe old saying goes.
These days, we use bad apple to refer to a\nperson in a group who causes problems\nfor the others.
Aaand no one is listening.
It might remind one of the recent "Menacing"\nincidents. We might think of these as bad\napples who've fallen from the wagon...
But people are more complex than you may\nthink. I'm sure even Menaces had extenuating\ncircumstances that led them astray.
What am I saying...? Okay class, open your\ntextbooks to where we left off last week.
Anyway, it's lunchtime now.
Ugh, we still have more classes after this.\nDefinitely the work of a Menace.
What happened yesterday was pretty scary,\nwasn't it?
You're kidding, right? It wasn't exactly\nsomething you could easily miss...
Pretty crazy, right? I guess they just like\nliving on the wild side...
I mean, what kind of person rides their bike\nthrough a train car?
By the time the station attendants showed\nup, the rider was already gone.
And the person they hit doesn't seem to be\ndoing too great either.
I wonder if they'll be condemned as\na Menace.
Magatsukami's the one who runs Divine\nJustice, a site that compiles videos of people\nwho've been causing trouble in the area.
Of course, that's not their real name.
It's the name of a website that compiles\nvideos of people who've been seen causing\ntrouble throughout town.
The person who runs the site is called\nMagatsukami. 'Course that's not their\nactual name.
Apparently, if you're condemned by\nMagatsukami, you're officially named\na Menace.
But honestly, I only scroll through the site\nto kill time so I don't really know much\nabout it.
There's no criminal intent or any hard\nevidence, so there's not much the police\ncan do about it.
Or... they're just unwilling to make a move.
But it seems like Divine Justice's getting\nreally popular.
It's got more subscribers than a B-list\ncelebrity's channels. Here, let me pull\nit up...
Hang on...
{NAME1}-kun, there's something I've\nbeen meaning to ask you... How is it you\nended up in Shibuya yesterday?
One minute you were on the train... and then\nyou just disappeared.
Motoha! Let's go grab lu\u2014 ...Oh?
We met this morning! You're in the same\nclass as Motoha?
Thank you again for finding my train pass.
Wait, hang on. Since when do you two know\neach other?
He really helped me out of a jam this\nmorning. Wait, am I... interrupting something?
Nope, not at all!
We're still getting lunch, right? It's gonna\nget crowded if we don't hurry.
Oh crap, it's already that late?
Ugh, we're really late. It's probably a\ncircus in there by now.
Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable,\n{NAME1}...
Let's go, Tomoko.
We keep running into each other today, huh?
Motoha was worried her favorite bread would\nsell out, so she went ahead to the\nschool store.
Even though she brought lunch from home.\nKinda reminds me of how she used to be before\nshe stopped playing.
Back in the day, Motoha and I would play\nbaseball together, but she ended up\nquitting the team.
She's been pretty down ever since... but\nlately, she seems to be getting more upbeat,\nwhich is a big relief.
Oh, and I bet I know why! Maybe it's because\nshe sits near you in class!
You're pretty modest, huh? You should be\nmore confident in yourself! You did save\nmy skin this morning after all.
No... I haven't done anything special. All I\ncan do is try and be there for her...
Oh, sorry. I shouldn't be holding you up.
You're headed to lunch now too, right?\nWhere do you usually eat?
The roof...? So that's why you were heading\nfor the stairs.
Hehe. Big fan of the private, fine\ndining experience?
I guess some of my classmates are like\nthat too.
Anyway, I should go meet up with Motoha.\nSee you later!
Over here.
I've come to answer your questions\nas promised.
What you witnessed yesterday... Mementos\nand Shadows...
This isn't something for the faint of heart.\nAre you ready?
Ahoom. Very well then... The other world\nyou visited is called "Mementos."
Mementos is an embodiment of the collective\nhuman unconscious, manifested as\nphysical space.
If you imagine the real world as one side of\na coin, Mementos exists in perfect parallel\non the opposite side.
Mementos is filled with the consciousness\nof various humans, so it would be apropos for\nyou to consider it a cognitive realm.
Think of it as a place constructed from the\nthoughts and feelings people hold toward\ntheir world.
It is a dark world. Bleak, and malignant.\nA place that light itself cannot reach.
That is to say, at present, people cannot\neven imagine the existence of hope in\ntheir world.
And I am sure you know why, do you not?
Precisely. You are quite the sharp one. Now,\nto continue...
The Metaverse contains two distinct species\nof Shadows.
The first, enemies that attack with no rhyme\nor reason.
These Shadows are not human, but monsters\nformed from warped desire.
The second, Shadows that are born from the\ndarkness of a human's heart in the\nreal world.
A person's true nature concealed within their\nheart, the embodiment of their desires... To\nput it differently, another self.
Hoohoo, you should already be aware of this.
Because you awakened your Shadow as\na Persona.
However, not just anyone can control what\nlies inside their heart.
If by some reason one's desires become\ncorrupted, their Shadow will run amok.
In the real world that person becomes\nwilling to hurt others with reckless abandon.
In my estimation, the Shadow of someone from\nthe real world is the central cause of the\nproblem we are facing now.
That person has been using the Metaverse as\na means to exploit the desires of others.\nAnd I am intent on catching them.
Of course it is not something one might\naccept so easily, but you have witnessed it\nfor yourself.
Shadows, the Metaverse, and what becomes of\nthose people who've lost all desire.
To make matters worse, when a human's\nShadow goes out of control...
...their warped desire can influence the\nShadows around them.
While it may be inadvertent, the triggering\nof those Shadows...
...stands as one cause for the loss of hope\nseen across the real world.
However, much about the Metaverse still\neludes me. Therefore, it is of critical\nimportance we learn more about it.
I hate to throw so much at you at once, but\nI would like to move on to discussing the\njob I have for you.
Correct. I wish to employ your abilities,\nso to speak.
That I did. Simply put, I wish to employ\nyour abilities.
As to what we will be stealing, I am sure\nyou can already guess.
I believe this will provide you the chance\nto experience the full range of your newly\nawakened Persona's abilities as well.
One cannot choose the time that opportunity\ncomes knocking. Though I can understand\nyour hesitation.
"Average?" Are you mad?
No. It must be the influence of this world's\nfading desire talking.
Let us leave it here for today.
Perhaps it will be more efficient to explain\nfurther once I've introduced our target.
I will be waiting for you in Shibuya\nafter school.
For you humans to recover what's been taken\nfrom you, we must steal it back.
To that end, we'll begin preparations later.\nSee you soon.
*screech*
What do you think you're doing!? You ruined\nmy takeoff!
Oh forget it, we can continue this later!
Sorry, {NAME1}-kun! I was so deep in\nthought I wasn't looking where I was going.
It actually had something to do with you...
Oh right! Here's your phone. It looks like\nit wasn't scratched or anything, but...
Wait. That icon...
Let's save the diving catches for outside,\nshall we?
Oh, Riko-senpai. Sorry about that. I just\ndidn't want his phone to break, so I...
Looks like you'd still make the starting\nlineup even now.
That's ancient history.
You're the one from the other day.
It was nothing, really. But...
You're the one who had trouble getting\nthrough the hallway yesterday, right? But...
It seems like there's something different\nabout you. No, it's probably just\nin my head...
Anyway, fifth period's about to start. Don't be late, you two.
Earth to {NAME1}-kun.
Fifth period is in the lab. If we don't leave now, we're totally screwed.
It was on {NAME1}-kun's phone too. This weird app that keeps reappearing no matter how many times I delete it...
I asked around, but no one has any idea what I'm talking about.
So why does {NAME1}-kun have the exact same app on his phone?
Plus he disappeared into thin air while on the train yesterday! Something seems off about him...
Huh? Tomoko, don't you have club today?
The club room's closed for maintenance, so we have it off. Thought it'd be nice to walk home together!
So you've come after all.
I am somewhat fatigued. Your half empty bag makes for a comfortable reprieve.
Just act natural. Standing out too much will alert our target.
All in good time. Now look over there.
He works for a company in Tokyo.
People have taken to calling him the "Subway Slammer."
He targets women he thinks won't fight back, and intentionally bodychecks them.
His way of satisfying a certain desire. A most repellent kind of human.
I feel the same.
To him, it's just an ordinary habit. But the root cause lies in the Metaverse.
I'm sure you can figure out why.
Precisely. Although...
I have yet to confirm the state of his Shadow for myself, so it is just conjecture at this point.
At a glance, this sort of behavior might not seem all that threatening to some.
For that reason, the police refuse to take\naction. Simply claiming it was an "accident"\nis enough for them to drop the issue.
So the victims are left with no recourse but to give up, as their faith in the world erodes away.
To be precise, Kiuchi's self-serving misdeeds are causing his victims to lose hope.
It won't work. If his Shadow is running loose, then...
...there's no way for us to stop his actions in the real world, and no chance he'll listen to reason.
The irony is, as long as he continues to believe there's nothing wrong with his behavior...
...he will never change, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
If we were to confront him here, there is a possibility that he'll fly into a rage and endanger everyone in the vicinity.
So, in the worst case...
Uh...
Fending off selfish desire with righteous\nindignation. You truly have awakened.
Tch! But now he's seen us. We should get out of here.
Aaah!
Are you okay!?
The baby! Oh dear god!
I think... I think it's too late...
What are you talking about?
It appears you're seeing things... Perhaps you're still exhausted from yesterday's excitement.
We should get away from here for now. Kiuchi is surely on his guard.
Let us make our way to the station square, where we exited Mementos last time.
Is that {NAME1}-kun? What's he doing here?
It looked like he was talking to that guy over...
He...
Sooorry! Apparently the ticket gate didn't like my train pass, so I got held up at the gate.
Is something wrong?
Nope, all good! Wanna hit the underground mall?
Huh, what are you talking about?
This seems like a good spot for now.
Let's get back on track. You understand the\npoint I was making, yes? It won't be possible\nto stop Kiuchi from the real world.
As I said before, I doubt the police are\ngoing to be of any help either.
Their desires are being siphoned just like\neveryone else's.
Sometimes there are problems of such\nmagnitude it takes the whole world working\ntogether to reach a solution.
In our current state, even people's basic\nhuman desires are evaporating.\nWe are in crisis.
There is a way for us to stop it.
We find Kiuchi's Shadow in the Metaverse\nand steal a certain precious item from it,\nthereby becoming Phantom Thieves.
As you are aware, the Metaverse is filled\nwith Shadows and other dangers\nyet unknown to us.
Here's what I need you to understand\ngoing forward.
By taking on this job together, you and I\nwill become business partners.
Do you truly understand what it means to be\na Phantom Thief?
What say you?
Well, that's to be expected.
Until yesterday you were an ordinary high\nschooler, and here I am asking you to take on\na job that will put your life at risk.
But I want you to remember this.
All those who've been abused by the\negocentric actions of people like Kiuchi\ncontinue to lose hope every day.
The worst outcome being that abuse drives them to take their own lives.
But you... You awakened your Persona through your unquenchable thirst for life.
And seeing as Shadows can only be defeated by Personas...
You are the only one who can take action against them.
If fiends like Kiuchi are pushing people to the brink of despair...
...then you may have the power to lead them back to light.
I will tell you after you become a Phantom Thief.
All I can say for now is, I strongly believe humans should embrace their desires.
But perhaps I am pushing this on you.
After all, choice is another precious human desire we ought to embrace.
Forget my words and take some time now to think it over for yourself.
If it behooves you, you might consider procuring restorative healing goods vital to our mission while you're there.
I will await your answer from here. If you decide to take on the job, do give a shout.
So you've returned. Might I take that to mean you wish to accept my offer?
Your answer, if you please.
That's what I've been longing to hear.
The eye-shaped icon on your phone.
The Metaverse Navigator. Give it a tap.
Understood. I will wait here until you've decided.
Well? Are you feeling prepared?
As I stated previously, Mementos is the collective unconscious of the masses.
If we use our real names, it might have an effect on their cognition...
...and risk our identities being discovered.
Therefore, we should use code names while working, to keep our real identities secret.
In any case, don't you find the thought of having a code name rather debonair?
What!? You don't understand "debonair"?
It's\u2014 Well, it means, um... "spiffy and happening"!
As for your code name, since I find you to be a marvel beyond my own imagining, we shall call you...
Wonder.
A keen intuition is necessary for this kind of thing. And my intuition tells me that you should be called Wonder.
And I would like you to refer to me as Cattle.
I'm not sure myself, but this is another intuition that I have. I shall henceforth be known as Cattle.
I will share the details of the job as we make our way, including the Treasure I mentioned earlier.
Now then, Wonder, let's move.
Argh! To think I didn't take notice of the enemy's approach!
These Shadows must be under the influence of Kiuchi's warped desire.
Wonder! Strike them down!
No need for combat instructions anymore, correct? Cut your way through them one by one!
Well, that's sorted. Let's make quick work of the rest.
Reinforcements!?
Tch, now we're surrounded. This is bad!
I'd really like to, but our way out is blocked!
Ngh! We'll have to fight our way out.
I'll deal with the Shadows behind us. You cut your way through!
Wonder!
Who is that?
Follow my lead!
Hmm, I expected you to come to that conclusion.
Resist it...
He disappeared... What just happened?
Anyway, let's get moving, Wonder.
We may have cleared out the enemies, but we shouldn't dawdle in a place like this.
You have been summoned.
Please come with me.
I have brought {NAME1} as requested.
In the real world, you are on your way home from school, hence your appearance.
So, you have made another deeply intriguing decision.
Your decision to enter the Metaverse tells me you possess the will to do just that.
As such, we may offer you our support.
Merope, I believe there was something you wanted to try. Go ahead.
Yes. They are manifestations I constructed\nfrom cognitions buried deep inside\nyour heart.
Correct. They are manifestations I have\nconstructed from cognitions buried deep\ninside your heart.
Whether they are persons you know closely,\nfamiliar faces you've seen in passing...
...or those of whom you have no memory, but\ncame into contact with unwittingly...
That I do not know.
Yet what is certain is that you are all\nlinked by the possession of strong desires.
They continue to embrace said desires,\nor perhaps, they once did.
Your cognitions reflect these persons at the\ntime they embraced desire most intensely\nin varied forms.
Even if you do not recognize them at present,\nembracers of desire are drawn\nto one another.
Sooner or later, you will certainly come\nto know them.
And in your world of fading desires, they\nwill sparkle like brilliant gemstones...
...like idols.
Furthermore, they can employ the power\nof Persona Duo.
A Duo, or pair, in this case refers to your\nPersona's second.
Envision it as two singers performing\ntogether in a duet.
Correct. A Duo, or pair, in this case refers\nto your Persona's second.
Like a duo of idols in concert, these\ncognitive forms will act as your backup in battle.
The Phantom Idols find inspiration from\nyour own Persona.
I have formed this prototype out of Shadows\nfrom Mementos and the desires of those\npersons stored in your cognition.
To act as Phantom Thieves, they will require\ncode names of their own.
Consequently, please forgive my boldness,\nas I designate names for each of them.
Hehe. I haven't felt such a sense of\naccomplishment as I do this moment.
I shall endeavor to provide you with even\ngreater support.
Oh, there is one more thing I must inform\nyou of.
Housed within your psyche there exists not\njust one personality\u2014or Persona\u2014but multiple.
As your perceptions materialize, they'll take\nroot in your heart. These faint flickers you\nfeel emerging are potential Personas.
Harness Phantom Idols, their Persona Duos,\nand everything else at your disposal...
...and you may yet escape the coming ruin.
...?
I am unaware of such a person, but...
Heheh. Just as I thought.
Forgive me. There are still many mysteries\nin this world... and perhaps some distortions\nas well.
Irregularities formed from the endless\nintermingling of consciousness... The extent\nof which we can never know.
If the matter intrigues you, I would suggest\ntaking action. It will likely prove\nanother way to strengthen your desire.
And I, as your concierge, will continue to\noffer you the fullest extent of my support.
That concludes our time here for now.
Should you require the strength of the\nPhantom Idols, call upon me from the depths\nof your heart.
You went blank for a moment there. Something\nthe matter?
You're not making any sense...
Whatever utterance, it seems to be beyond my\ncomprehension. Or perhaps you intended to\nflout the conventions of communication?
Your code name is "Wonder." Mine is "Cattle."
Was that... relevant to something?
You must be fatigued.
Between school and battling those shadows,\nyou've certainly overdone it.
In that case, I know just the thing.
Brace yourself...
You, Wonder, are about to be the first human\nto ever witness this.
Transform!
Phew. This will do.
I mentioned that Mementos contains the\ncognitions of the masses, yes?
Well I just made use of someone's cognition\nabout "animals transforming into vehicles."
Why such a thought is abundant here...\nI do not know.
Now get in! I'll need you to be the driver.
Start the engine and step on the gas. Then\nuse the wheel to steer.
I'll keep an eye out and take action if\nneed be.
Excellent. Now let's get to work.
First, let's head deeper into Mementos.\nI will alert you as we approach\nour destination.
Shadows... But our destination is just ahead.\nWe're going to have to fight them.
There aren't as many as before, but don't\ndrop your guard. Here they come!
A new enemy!?
You know what that is? Then I trust you.\nLet's wipe out those enemies.
Well, that's sorted.
About that, um... Phantom Rival, was it?
They seem to have an uncompromising air\nabout them... Well, no matter.
Cognitive forms with Persona-like power...\nI never could have imagined such a\nthing exists.
I'll let you manage these um, Phantom Idols,\nas you put it.
Let's hurry onward.
A boy you're curious about?
Yeah...
Oooh, who is it? Someone from school?
Well...
Ah, sweet, sweet Tomoko. I can read you\nlike a book. To think you have eyes for more\nthan just baseball!
Okay, listen, it's not that I like him or\nanything! I'm just a little curious is all.
Let's get some food and you can tell me\nall about it.
Hm?
That short-haired girl...
All right, according to my intelligence, this\nis the spot.
As a native to the Metaverse, I have a\ncertain level of understanding about\nits structure.
I can hear, just barely, the voice at the\nheart of the collective unconscious.
You probably can't hear it yourself, but I\nuse it to gather information on\nthe Metaverse.
It's certainly around her\u2014 Hm?
Within the vast bounds of Mementos exist locations manifested from the warped desires of certain individuals.
Like a fortress from which the Shadow of an unscrupulous human can steal other's desires.
Here Kiuchi rules as the castle's king, and enemy Shadows are his loyal subjects.
This Palace is also the site of our first job.
Come along, Wonder!
So this is Kiuchi's Palace, huh? Looks a lot more like a baseball stadium to me.
I suppose Kiuchi has a vivid imagination.
Seems like we won't be getting in through the front door.
Let's investigate the surrounding area.
Looks like we could get in through that duct.
Hehe, I agree.
It will leave no trace of our intrusion, in addition to being quite stylish.
Taking an alternative entrance feels much more suited to us Phantom Thieves.
However, we'll have to put a pause on that plan for the moment...
Sorry to disappoint you, but I am unable to fly in the Metaverse.
Besides, I would stand no chance against enemy Shadows as an owl.
And of course, this form has a much more stylish, Phantom Thief feel to it, don't you agree?
I think I know of a way in.
Simply locating Kiuchi's Palace is good enough for today.
Let's return to the real world. We can discuss our next steps there.
We shouldn't stay here.
That's\u2014
We're back.
I have some crafting expertise to share with you.
To enter the Palace through unconventional\nmeans, we'll need to construct some special\ninstruments I like to call...
...infiltration tools.
But we'll need a workbench to make them...\nwhich I'll assume you don't have, based on\nyour expression.
Then we'll have to procure one.
Now where would one go to pro\u2013
Oh?
Hello again, {NAME2}-kun.
What are you doing milling around here?
A workbench? Are you planning to take up a new hobby?
They probably sell that sort of thing.
{NAME2}, have you been to Yongen before?
You can take the Hanzomon Line straight there from Shibuya. The Hanzomon Line's right down those stairs there.
Ahh, Yongen... That brings me back to when\nmy hubby and I decided to move in together.\nWe were both broke back then, you see...
And so we went to that little secondhand shop to pick out a fridge for our place...
Now I wanted a fridge with an ice maker, but of course he said, "I will not be a man with a pink refrigerator!"
But he finally gave in in the end. And just when I was thinking, "Can I really go on living with a man like this?"
I hate to say it but...
There is nothing in my power to stop this lady from talking. If you wouldn't mind stepping in...
Oh my, look at the time! I've got to get dinner started.
My hubby's coming straight home from work today, so I better hop to it. Later, hon!
Thank goodness, the torture's over.
That "hubby" fellow she's always talking about...
He must be a saint to stay married to her.
Well, good for them I suppose.
The secondhand shop in Yongen-Jaya, huh? We should take the Hanzomon Line.
That guy... It's almost like he's with someone even though he's alone...
No, I'm probably imagining things. He looks just like a regular guy...
What are you doing? We're headed to Yongen-Jaya, aren't we?
We're here.
This is the first time I've been here, but it feels familiar somehow.
Well, no use ruminating on it.
You're probably right.
Hmm...
I can't seem to find anywhere that sells loose leaf tea... I'm still not used to reading Japanese either...
Ah, there's the secondhand shop. Let's find ourselves a workbench.
Hello there! Can I help you find something?
Oh, this is just delightful!
These days it's all about the internet, isn't it?
Everyone's desperate to keep up with the latest trends.
All they care about is what's new, while the old ways are forgotten more and more every day.
So to see a youngster like yourself take an interest in secondhand goods...
...it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.
Anyway, you wanted a workbench, right?
Here you go! It's antique, but should still be up to the task.
This one's on the house.
Don't worry about it. Just be sure to come around again, all right?
I'll have to charge next time though. Hahah.
It's big, so I'll have it delivered for ya. You live in the city, yeah?
In that case, it should be delivered by tonight. I'll be right back with the paperwork.
Here you go. Just write your name and address right there.
Thanks.
Okie doke, I'll get this shipped to the address you gave. Come again!
Okay, workbench secured. Now let's head to your house and await its arrival.
You were scouted? That's amazing! We should celebrate!
Slow your roll! It still depends on how I do in the tournament next week.
Just getting invited to compete is amazing in itself! You've worked so hard for this.
Compared to you I'm just aimlessly drifting through life. Haha.
Hey, Motoha... Do you ever miss baseball?
Huh? Oh, well um... I don't know.
I was just thinking, if I win the tournament...
Maybe we could play catch together? Just like old times?
Not as like hardcore training or anything, just simple fun.
Hmmm...
Okay, sure.
*gasp* Hurray!
I think the last time we got to play together we were still in grade school. Gosh, how many years is that?
All right, I've gotta win next week for sure.
You're just beaming, aren't you, Tomoko?
Hehehe.
Oh, so how are things with you lately? Any good news?
Well, I wouldn't call it good exactly, but...
More like there's been some weird things going on that I'm interested in.
But wait, what about you? Who's this guy you're interested in?
He goes to Kokatsu, right? I could tell by your face before.
So... who is it? Somebody I know? Is it... a full-on crush?
Sheesh, enough with the third degree. It's... um... the person who sits... behind you...
Behind me!?
You mean... *gasp*
Wait, hold on!
It's not that I like him necessarily, I'm just interested in him as a person, kinda...
Haha. Ah... I see. I mean this isn't a great example, but...
Remember in elementary school when there was that one player I really looked up to? Kinda like that?
Uh... Oh, yeah! Totally. Anyway, I'm keeping an eye on him till I can find out more.
You mean until you start getting misty eyed and your heart goes aflutter? Ah, sweet, sweet, Tomoko.
It's Divine Justice... Whoa, apparently there's another Menace.
Whoa, Motoha, look! There's a post from Magatsukami. This looks serious.
They'll be condemned tomorrow morning! We can't miss this!
I guess it's stupid to look for love when the world's like this.
Sorry. Talking about the tournament's made me wanna get my body movin'!
It's cool. I've got nothing going on, so I don't mind tagging along.
Hey, Motoha?
Yeah?
Um, listen...
If going there brings back bad memories for you, we can totally just forget about it, okay?
Oh, it's {NAME1}-kun.
What's wrong?
I don't know! I guess 'cause of what we talked about before, now this!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I see... Interested in him as a "person," are we?
You headed out somewhere? Or are you on your way home?
*gasp*
Uh, don't worry about her. We were just about to head that way is all.
I know that place! Yongen, right?
Pheew! Boy am I thirsty! I'm just gonna go grab a drink real quick...
Wai\u2014 Huh? What!? Where are you going!?
Don't worry about it, I'll be riiight back. Keep an eye on Tomoko for me, {NAME1}-kun, would ya?
W-Wait, come back!
Motoha's taking her sweet time, huh?
She's probably picking out drinks for us too. She's always putting other people first...
You know, Motoha's always been really selfless.
Of course it makes her a really kind person... but it also means she doesn't think enough about her own needs.
Yeah. We were battery mates in little league.
Unlike me, Motoha was this ultra-skilled baseball prodigy.
Like scarily good... Pitching, hitting, defense... She was a triple threat.
Motoha could definitely go pro. That's what\neveryone said.
Even Motoha herself wanted to. It was her dream. I used to love listening to her talk about it.
But... there was an incident, and she felt responsible for what happened. She ended up quitting because of it.
Of course it wasn't actually her fault. If anything it was more of an accident, but how do I say this... She...
Quitting something she loved that much must've been really hard on her.
She was still depressed by the time she started high school.
That's why I...
I'm gonna chase that dream for both of us!
I'll become a baseball player, and leave a mark big enough to fill Motoha's shoes.
That way, maybe Motoha can love baseball again... and smile with her whole heart like she did back then.
Someday... even if it's just for fun...
...I just want us to be battery mates again.
Th-Thanks!
But please don't say anything to Motoha, okay? I don't wanna burden her with it.
This keychain's actually a present we exchanged back in little league.
She's a pitcher, so I got her the one shaped like a baseball, and she gave me the catcher's mitt.
It's really precious to me...
I seriously panicked when I almost lost it.
Thanks again for finding it for me, {NAME1}-kun.
When she quit she said she "didn't deserve" to keep hers anymore, and gave it back.
But when the day comes that we can finally play together again, I'm gonna give it back to her.
Sorry! I didn't mean to start talking about something so heavy. Really, sorry, {NAME1}-kun.
Speaking of, where is that girl? She still picking drinks?
Tomoko...
*sniffle* *exhale* Okay, pull it together. Not in front of them...
Sorry for the wait! I got some for everyone!
Okay, we'll meet tomorrow morning on the platform for the Inogami Line!
Talk to you then! See ya!
See you later.
So... that's how kids your age mingle?\nSounded complicated.
The workbench should be arriving tonight. We should get home as soon as possible.
You haven't heard of Magatsukami's Divine Justice?
Found some interesting article, have you?
Hoohoo, caught you off-guard, didn't I?
Forgive me. There's much I want to learn\nabout you humans. It seems smartphones are\nvery convenient sources of information.
Anyhoo, your workbench should be arriving soon, yes?
What an odd thing to say. I'm already home, aren't I?
I don't see the issue here. Your parents are overseas, are they not?
To be clear, I consider this place our base.
To me, "base" is synonymous with "home."
Now don't get upset, I understand. Whatever trouble my staying here causes, I promise I'll make up for it.
Besides, if I stay here, I can teach you how to make infiltration tools.
With those, we can surely get into Kiuchi's Palace with ease.
Delivery!
Looks like we'll need to assemble it first. Okay, let's bring it up to the second floor.
I'd prefer to keep the first floor as a place for unwinding, so let's set it up in your room.
All right, nicely done. It fits the space perfectly too.
Now I can guide you on how to make infiltration tools.
In the future we'll craft them from supplies we've collected, but this time we can use what I have on hand.
Follow my instructions.
Yes...
Ah, that part's not meant to overlap... Try to pass it through the bottom there and... Yes, that's it.
Excellent work.
We can certainly infiltrate Kiuchi's Palace with this.
I'll explain how to use it when the time comes.
Ah, here's a leftover part. Hold onto that.
Hoohoo, looks like crafting infiltration tools has given you some confidence. Splendid!
Now then, the night's waning. It's been quite the big day of firsts for you. Good work.
You should rest soon. I will as well.
Apologies for the lateness of the hour.
It seems you have devoted yourself to strengthening your desire. Excellent.
Do you recall what I said about seeking interaction?
Splendid.
You may forge hope through interaction with other embracers of desire.
I would like to stress the significance of this possibility.
There are some in your world who cannot take\nnotice of their desires on their own.
That is why interaction with others is so meaningful.
You likely haven't noticed yourself, but there are people you've influenced through your interactions.
Isn't that right, Merope?
Multiple in fact...
Preamble aside, I must relay another warning.
Bringing your own desires to fruition... may come at the cost of hindering another's.
It's a principle the world has largely turned a blind eye to, but I am referring to survival of the fittest.
If you find accepting ruin unbearable, you'll do well to remain on the winning side at all costs.
I've already given you much to think about, however, we are hoping for your success.
Well then, we look forward to your next visit. Heheheh.
Not bad.
All right then, let us head for school.
We're business partners, are we not? By going together we can share information more readily.
You look as though you want to say something. No matter, I won't press you on it.
We're meant to meet with those girls from yesterday, correct? We should head out soon, or we won't make it in time.
The train will arrive shortly on track one.
Again!?
But I deleted it...
Oh, there's another post on Divine Justice...
"Menace Condemned... the Subway Slammer?"
Motoha!
Huh?
Ngn!
Kiuchi!?
Tomoko!
It wasn't on purpose. That's not my fault.
Hey, wai\u2014
Answer me...
Tomoko! Please, answer me!
{NAME1}-kun!
Is she a friend of yours? Please take her away from here.
We'll take care of the girl on the tracks. Leave the rest to us.
Why's the train stopped? Gimme a break...
Did a girl just go flying over that barrier? She must be seriously injured!
Dear lord... That's definitely the Subway Slammer. Menace in the flesh.
Menace...? So the police won't be interested, then.
Hey, it's a busy station. It happens. Kid just got unlucky...
Tsk. It seems desire is being drained left, right and center.
To not even bat an eyelid upon witnessing the misfortune that befalls another...
I at least want to go with her to the hospital.
That's fine. We'll let you know when we're leaving.
I'm sorry...
Can we talk?
Sorry, my thoughts are a mess right now...
...so I'm just gonna say what's on my mind.
That guy who pushed Tomoko... You spoke to him in Shibuya the other day, didn't you?
Oh... Then I guess I misunderstood. Sorry.
Because I know him.
Kiuchi. An ex-pro baseball player. He's... retired now.
This girl knows Kiuchi!
Who said that...?
Not just that, but she can hear my voice as well!
There's an owl... in your bag!?
Which means that voice was...
The ambulance is waiting outside.
There's only room for one though. What would you like to do?
I'm going!
I'll head to school after I find out Tomoko's condition. We'll continue this later.
The train on track one will resume operation momentarily.
I know you must be worried about the girl who fell... but we should let her handle it.
Let's head to school.
A train pulling into Shibuya stalled this morning. You really think it was the Subway Slammer's fault?
Can't say for sure. You know, I've been struck by him at Shibuya Station before.
I noticed a bad bruise on my shoulder when I got home.
Oh my god, that's got to be a criminal offense! Did you file a report?
No... It seemed like it wouldn't be worth all the trouble.
I know what you mean.
These people are losing hope as well. The situation is more dire than I thought.
Because I saw him do it with my own eyes!
It was the Subway Slammer!
Well, are you sure it's the same guy? Do you have any proof?
Proof...?
Cameras! Check the security cameras!
I mean, we'll take a look but...
I know his name! He's an ex-baseball...
Unless we catch him in the act, there's really no way to arrest him.
Getting pushed around at rush hour's just an everyday occurrence.
Even if we catch him, there's really nothing we can do if he says it was an accident.
Any other officer would tell you the same thing.
B-But...
I know it's hard to hear, but it's better to just avoid people like that in the first place.
If you see him, run. That's really the best advice I can give.
But that's...
Okay, that's it for homeroom today.
Oh, and about what happened this morning... I'm sure many of you've already heard, but...
Noge-san from Class D...
I was right there when it happened.
Quiet.
Since the incident is still fresh, make sure that you all stay clear of danger, okay?
The Subway Slammer was officially condemned, wasn't he?
He must've been behind this too.
Noge-san's real unlucky.
This is not what I had in mind.
Arai-san!
I thought because of... Well, I thought you would have stayed home today.
I'm fine. Sorry I'm late.
I'll be waiting on the roof at lunch.
Sorry to take over your lunch period.
Okay, so it seems like Tomoko's life isn't in danger or anything like that.
She was able to talk to me just fine.
The thing is...
She was supposed to compete in a tournament with the baseball team...
But it seems like when she fell on the tracks she... messed up her shoulder pretty badly.
She should be fine to play just for fun, but as a player she...
I went to report Kiuchi to the police before coming here, but it was pointless...
Sorry, anyway, I called you here to pick up where we left off this morning...
{NAME1}-kun, are you and Kiuchi buddies or something?
You've got the wrong idea.
The owl!
Is this bird... a friend of yours? It was talking to you before.
Business...? What?
So it's your pet?
The more accurate term would be business partners.
Um, what?
Wait, so disappearing from the train and all\nthis other weird stuff going on around you...
...has to do with this "business" you're talking about?
Do not call me an owl. My name is Lufel.
I sensed there'd be some pertinent\ninformation to be gained from your\nconversation, hence I revealed myself.
Huh...
And what is your name?
Motoha... Arai...
Well then, Motoha Arai, allow me to fill you in. Kiuchi is no friend of ours.
He is, in fact, our target. For a certain plan we have in the works.
Kiuchi's your target?
We need a target for our Metaverse Navigator application to home in on.
Metaverse Navigator...?
Do you mean this?
Precisely. Hoohoo, I see. That explains how you could hear my voice.
Motoha Arai. For whatever reason, you seem to know a great deal about Kiuchi.
And despite knowing there's no way he can be punished by law, you seem intent on finding a way to stop him.
Moreover, the fact that you can hear my voice means that... you hold great potential for hope.
Potential for... hope?
Those who have abandoned hope are not able to hear my voice.
It seems we'll be able to execute Kiuchi's change of heart sooner than I expected.
Change of heart?
Just hold on a damn minute. I have no idea what's going on anymore. First Tomoko gets hurt, now there's a talking owl and...
Changing Kiuchi's heart? Do you know what that means, {NAME1}-kun?
Motoha Arai. Let me ask you this. Knowing\nwhat you do about Kiuchi, what are you\nhoping to accomplish?
What do you want to do about him?
What... do I want to do?
I don't know... The police clearly won't\nhelp, and I don't have the physical strength\nto stop him on my own.
So what will you do?
You haven't truly manifested your desire for yourself.
Let me give you a word of advice. If you lack the will to fight for your goal, don't bother hoping at all.
All the people of this world are doing just that. Surely you can fall in with the crowd.
Are you saying... I should just let Kiuchi off the hook!?
After what he did to Tomoko... he'll just keep attacking more people!
The "Subway Slammer" even got condemned by Divine Justice this morning.
Which means "he's a serious threat the police are doing nothing about, everyone watch out!"
So now all we can do is just give up!
If we let him get away with this, how many more people do you think will end up hurt!?
Whatever. I'll deal with this on my own.
Sorry about lunch.
You looked like you wanted to say something.
Listen, battling in the Metaverse means being at constant risk of death.
It's not a place we can bring someone lacking in resolve.
Whether she chooses to proceed or turn back is her decision.
But if this Motoha Arai's desire is real, then it seems your fates will intertwine. Hoohoohoo...
Oh nothing.
We'll go to Kiuchi's Palace after school. Now that we have our way in, we'll investigate the inside.
But I should ask just in case, are you resolved to continue tracking down Kiuchi?
Hoohoo, and that's why you're my business partner.
Let us head for Mementos. The procedure is the same as last time. Open the Metaverse Navigator at the station squa\u2014
Oi! Hide!
That girl... It appears she is able to sense the Metaverse.
She must have known you disappeared from the train because she witnessed it happen.
Did she come here because she anticipated our next move?
I appreciate the sincerity of her desire, but...
If a human without a Persona gets lost in the Metaverse, they're sure to fall victim to wandering Shadows.
Therefore we cannot allow her to get mixed up in this. Nor can we take our eyes off her, given the situation.
For all we know, she could be searching for Kiuchi. If she finds him, she might be the one in danger.
I'm not proud to say it, but we should surveil this Motoha Arai before entering the Metaverse.
Motoha Arai... was it?
Kiuchi!
I remember you. Looks like the little smart-mouthed brat's all grown up.
You know, you ought to address your superiors with\n"-san." I thought I already taught you that.
I've been looking for you.
Ah. This about the pigtailed girl that fell on the train tracks?
Why are you doing this?
"Why?" Because I want to.
But you should know better than anyone...
...the real reason I have to wear some monkey suit and work a goddamn desk job!
But of course that was just a silly ol' accident, right?
Apologize to Tomoko!
What if I say no?
The police will\u2014
Do what, exactly?
Look around you. Nothing but a buncha washed-out faces flatter than stale beer.
I can push them around, and they'll just cry themselves to sleep. And anyone who sees, they'll just pretend they didn't!
You think some cop's gonna sympathize with you? What year do you think this is?
So the Subway Slammer's been declared a Menace. Now what? Everyone already knows there's nothing they can do to stop me!
The whole subway's mine for the slammin'! Ahahahahahahahaha!
Ngh...
So, I think it's time for the next accident!
After all, you were the one I was aiming for that time, Motoha Arai-chan.
Hngh\u2014
Who are you supposed to be?
{NAME1}-kun!?
Tsk. Arai's little friend, huh?
Someone! Help! That's the Subway Slammer!
Hello!?
You got dirt in your ears or something? I told you already. Nobody cares about strangers anymore, idiot!
I'm gonna keep doing whatever I want, for as long as I want!
And eventually I'm gonna get you too, Motoha Arai! Gahahahahahaha!
Kiuchi... why?
We should get going.
It's clear we need to stop him without a moment's delay, or the number of victims will keep piling up.
You have a job to do, right? Don't worry about me.
Is there really... nothing I can do...?
Kiuchi, huh?
He takes advantage of the world's fading hope...
...and uses it to fulfill his own twisted desires without a grain of remorse.
His despicability knows no bounds. Which makes him a fitting target for robbing.
I'll share the details when the time comes. First we should head for Kiuchi's Palace.
Looks like there's still no way of getting\nthrough the front entrance.
Wonder, let's use our infiltration tool. We'll get in through that duct.
You're quite the wiz with that wire. It looks like we can make good use of that skill as we move forward.
By the way, is it just me, or did you have a little too much fun with that?
Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. But that level of skill...
Oh I can tell. Even behind that mask it's obvious.
You should enjoy it! Such is the work of a Phantom Thief.
Anyway, let's get through the duct.
The interior is baseball themed as well. How telling...
As I said before, a Palace is a manifestation of its ruler's twisted desires.
Therefore, the shape of this place indicates that...
...it was constructed from Kiuchi's desires... that are related to baseball.
I don't know whether he's obsessing over some\npast glory days or what, but he appears to\nhave an abnormal fixation on baseball.
Now it's time to get our real mission underway.
Stealing the "Treasure" hidden within the palace.
That's right. It's about time I filled you\nin. Let's talk.
Precisely. It's time I ought to explain our\ngoal, and the Treasure, in more detail.
A Palace's Treasure is...
...an item that symbolizes the root cause of its ruler's warped desire.
Why did Kiuchi become the Subway Slammer? This item points to the origin of that behavior.
It is a symbol of warped desire, and constitutes the very core of what gives the Palace its form.
If we manage to steal it, we can induce a change of heart in Kiuchi.
Therefore, locating the Treasure that's hidden somewhere in the heart of this Palace is top priority.
Well, like any treasure, we can expect it to be tightly guarded. Therefore we should focus on learning its location first.
The enemies here are likely more aggressive than the ones we've faced thus far.
That is, the Shadows of this Palace are distinct from those inside Mementos.
Under the control of Kiuchi's intense desires, they have forgotten their true forms.
They will obey his desire and stop at nothing to destroy us for the sake of their king.
If you feel underprepared, we could always return to the real world and stock up on whatever items we need.
Now then, Wonder, let's begin!
What am I even doing?
I hate to admit it, but that owl was right...
I'm running my mouth, meanwhile having no clue what I actually want to do.
Kiuchi... Seeing the player I looked up to suddenly appear and...
...do something so horrible to Tomoko...
God, I wish someone would come up and tell me this is all some big joke...
Just a joke...
What was that again, about a change of heart...?
Metaverse Navigator...
Aha! That room is...
Wonder, take out that Shadow. If this goes well, we'll have a safe place to rest inside the Palace.
Simply superb! You've really gotten the hang of this, Wonder.
You seem awfully satisfied.
Hey, listen! Do you think I'll ever feel\nfulfilled like that?
So I've just gotta follow my heart, huh?\nI like the way you think!
You somehow remind me of myself... Wait...
I'd forgotten. I originated from humanity's Sea of Souls...
From now on, I will become a part of you! Your devotion and desire!
What was that? The Shadow became your mask?
This is beyond my comprehension as well, but...
It seems like the Shadow's desire to join you transformed it into a Persona for you to use.
Or something like that...?
Well, either way we defeated the enemy. We can talk it over more inside the room just ahead.
It's just a hunch, but I think this room...
Yes. Let's go in, Wonder.
We can catch our breath for a while. The Shadows won't come in here.
The distortion of the Palace is weaker in this room.
But I'm still not convinced we can rest here safely. I'd like to poke around a bit more just to be sure.
Heheheh. You have shown new potential once again.
We are referring to the new Persona you have gained.
Normally, a single human can possess only\none Persona... but you are capable of\nharnessing many more.
I believe I've told you this before...
You are capable of reawakening not just your own, but others' forgotten desires.
This applies to Shadows as well. Your exuberant passion for life holds infinite possibilities.
This rare power allows you to yield multiple Personas. Use it wisely.
You, who have awakened to this power, hold even more potential...
But the time you will know it is further still.
Heheh, I must agree with your concierge Merope.
Well... When your heart has strengthened through bonds with others, we will summon you again.
Please do work to foster your desire.
So long as you steadfastly cultivate desire, a path will surely open itself to you.
Apologies for the abrupt summons. For now, please proceed the way your will directs you.
Something the matter, Wonder? You've been quite still for some time.
Well, no matter. I've searched the room, and it seems to be free of danger.
Shadows won't be coming to steal our desires in here, so we can prepare and strategize at ease.
Let me know when you are ready to depart. And don't forget to prepare.
So Kiuchi was a baseball player? That doesn't match the impression he gave off in Shibuya.
Anyhoo, how are you thinking we should proceed from here? Are there any leads we can\u2014
What the...!? How...!? Where am\u2014what is this place!?
Motoha Arai!? What are you doing here?
H-H-How the heck did I get here? I was just at Shibuya Station a second ago.
I see. You must have used the Metaverse Navigator. The eye-shaped icon on your phone.
Metaverse... Navigator?
Wh-Wh-What are you!? Some sort of mascot!? Wait... Black hood... Yellow eyes... Are you a hooded ghost!?
Hooded ghost?
And what are you!? A burglar!?
Uh, wait a second... Is that you... {NAME1}-kun?
W-What?
Literally what is happening? Wait, is this like... a cosplay convention?
I mean, there are weird statues of Kiuchi, and apparently merch...?
This is Kiuchi's Palace. The decor has materialized from his cognitions.
Kiuchi's... Palace? Built from his... cognitions?
Mhmmm... Aha! I get it! This is a dream! Yup, for sure.
While I appreciate her tenacity, we need to get her out of here right now.
We may not be able to defend her if Shadows come attacking.
Hmph. Automatic lock, eh?
There must be a clue around here somewhere that shows how to get out.
Wait, what? We're locked in!?
Motoha Arai. I would like you to share any information you have on Kiuchi with us forthwith.
Huh...?
This photo... It's from my little league baseball training. What's it doing here?
Think harder! That's when it happened. I, the star athlete, entered a slump!
Was that...?
I said this was Kiuchi's Palace, did I not? His cognitions from real life...
...and the source of his twisted desire, are all reflected here.
Oh... I see.
To think Motoha Arai would be pictured in Kiuchi's Palace...
He must feel some kind of disturbing connection to her.
......!
Oh... No, it's nothing, really.
Hmm, seems the door unlocked itself. I suppose looking at the photo was the key.
We've gained enough valuable intel on Kiuchi. Now let's make our exit.
This is bad!
Waaah!
What's that? Intruders?
Then start with that!
I didn't think you'd have the guts to face me willingly, Motoha Arai.
How about a trip down memory lane? Your\noffenses, your crimes...! I'll make you\nremember... in excruciating detail.
Execution of intruders will begin momentarily.
Oww... What the hell is going on?
We were dropped down a pit. It must have been a trap for intruders.
Before anything, we need to find a way out of here. Wonder, search the room for an exit.
Every exit is sealed... There must be an unlocking mechanism like the one before around here somewhere.
Wow, that was truly a nice, square hit!
What is it?
Do you see that?
This is from... after that baseball clinic...?
Motoha Arai, what was your reaction when you managed to hit Kiuchi's game-deciding slider?
I thought Kiuchi's pitching stance looked really cool!
Oh, I meant to ask how you felt. Like, "The ball was fast!", or "I felt amazing!" Any thoughts like that?
He threw me a slider just like I asked him to!
So I think he's just the best!
Hahah, I see you have a lot of respect for him!
Now, let's hear a word from Kiuchi on Arai's performance.
Ah, she's, uh... what'd you call it...? Talented. She seems like a talented kid.
A fine line drive so powerful it slipped through your grip resulting in a double!
You even fell on your backside. Talk about putting on a show!
Tsk...
I don't think I need to ask this but... that was all an act, right?
What?
I mean... Haha, of course it was! She's only in grade school!
Indeed she is.
As someone on track for the major league, I'm sure even pro hitters would be in for a challenge if you were playing seriously.
Kiuchi...?
Huh? Uh... Nothing, I'm cool! Haha...
Uh... Anyway, Arai, I hear you actually main as a pitcher.
Yes! I love throwing and hitting!
!?
A pitcher with a strong sense for batting too.\nWe're certainly looking forward to what\nthe future has in store for you.
That's all for our ground coverage from the baseball training infield.
That video... Was that from a baseball clinic Kiuchi taught when he was still a professional player?
His pitch got knocked out of the park by a grade-school-aged Motoha Arai...
Better yet, he got knocked flat on his back trying to stop it. That must have damaged his ego.
Yeah... Kiuchi has been in a big slump ever since...
All because I hit that pitch...
I see we have a lot to process here, but now is not the time.
Shadows could burst in here any minute. We must find some means of escape.
Although I do wonder... why were we just shown a video of Kiuchi's past?
Something feels off about this. It's as if someone planned to make us watch that video.
And there was that pitfall before. I think they might be on to us.
Stay on your guard.
I hear your stats are in the dirt recently.
Huh? There's another video.
Now here I thought you were aiming for the majors.
Well... yeah...
You don't sound so sure. And you should know crying, "Slump!" as an excuse isn't gonna cut it.
Coach, can't you push him a little harder?
We're all here to support you.
And with the major league on the horizon, we've even heard word about a few potential sponsors.
*sigh* He understands that, but...
Well it's that or be known as the guy that got beat by an elementary school girl.
What was it those rag mags were saying? "Kiuchi Clocked by Clutch Hit Cutie"?
If you have even a shred of dignity, you'd get back out on the field and prove them wrong.
Understood.
Ngh!
Kiuchi.
Right. Coming...
That appears to be from the early days of his downward spiral.
It's nothing. I'm\u2014
Agh!
You see the article?\nApparently Kiuchi's\nin a slump.
Hey, the girl in the news looks like Arai.
No way! Seriously?
Yeah, seems like he got hurt during the baseball clinic.
From the pitch Arai hit?
Yeah, now Kiuchi's\nin a total slump\nbecause of it.
Arai...
Arai did it.
It's her fault.
Completely her fault.
No! Motoha didn't do anythi\u2014!
Arai ruined his career...
Thanks to her, he'll never...
Aghhh!
It's my fault...
All my fault...
Wha\u2014!?
The offender, Motoha Arai, is in custody!
Eliminate the intruders!
Tch! Get ready, Wonder. Here they come!
Curses. They knew we were here all along!?
We can't stay here! Let's go find her!
Hey! What the heck are you doing!? Let me go!
Aw, look who's exacting demands.
Fancy meeting you here at Kiuchi-sama Stadium, Motoha Arai.
That face... That voice... You're just like\nKiuchi... but how!?
That's Kiuchi"-sama" to you!
You really are the same little insolent brat\nyou were back then, only bigger!
You goddamn pest. It was all your fault!
All because you hit my game-winning slider ten years ago.
How do you know that...? I guess you really are Kiuchi.
I said it's "-sama" to you!
Ow!
To think you had the gall to tell me to apologize back at the station.
Aren't I the one who deserves an apology? You ruined my career!
Hngh...
This is a good time to teach you somethin' ya\nnever learned at baseball training: how to\nbeg for forgiveness like a big girl.
Let's see you bow your head in shame!
Tch! She's been captured!
Oh look, your little friends are here. What's with all these damn intruders?
Is that... Kiuchi's Shadow!?
Shadows are the embodiment of a human's hidden, inner self. That form is a manifestation of his desires.
But more importantly, we need to save Motoha Arai!
Yeah right!
You can just stand and watch. My business is with this one.
Once I settle the score with her, you can all go. Well, after you've undergone some intense training.
Agh! That hurts!
Ahahaha! Like I'd listen to you? You don't seem to get how screwed you really are!
What? You plan to hold her hostage? You... Monster!
Ahh, ngh...
You make one move against me and I'll kill her. You hear me? I'll kill her!
And I'll get away with it too! Because this is my Palace! Ahhahahahahahahaha!
Now, kneel before me.
What's wrong? So scared your brain stopped working?
Why don't I jog your memory?
I quit baseball because of you!
Hgh... Agh!
All because you hit that damn pitch! I had a slump, and it ruined my chance at the major leagues!
Ah... Aah...
If this goes on much longer, she'll completely break down...
He's r-right... I...
It's all m-my fault...!
That's right! You stole my life as an athlete away from me and destroyed my dreams!
What did you just say?
You don't know what you're talking about, so shut it! No one wants to hear from the outfield!
Wha...
What did you say!?
That's right! She is not the one who sullied your glorious future.
The one who abandoned that desire... that dream, was you, Kiuchi!
What! How dare you!?
As humans live and pursue their desires...
...sometimes they can get in the way of another's.
But that doesn't mean they should abandon their hopes completely.
You simply wanted someone else to blame, so you could justify throwing away your desires.
And now, you, with your distorted,\nself-aggrandizing soul, continue to steal\naway the hopes of countless others!
S-Shut your mouth! None of this would have happened if it weren't for this brat!
I always thought... I was the one to blame...
Because of me, Kiuchi, the player I looked up to most, quit baseball.
I no longer felt worthy of the life I had... and lost the will to hope for anything.
I thought I had to give up baseball... give up my dreams...
...!?
Enough with the chitchat!
Listen up! I've got your little friend here by the neck!
So shut up, or the next crack of the bat's gonna be a skull splitter!
Tch...!
Now hurry up and beg for mercy, Motoha Arai!
Or do I have to teach you a lesson like I did to that pigtailed brat!?
You mean... Tomoko?
Huh? Ohhh, was that her name?
Her name is Tomoko Noge... She's my best friend.
Ever since little league, and even after I quit baseball... Tomoko has always been there for me.
She dreamed of being a baseball player.
I'm no better than you... I chose to abandon my dreams.
I made myself out like some tragic martyr...
I kept up a front while carrying this huge emptiness inside me... I even wished I was dead.
But Tomoko...!
Tomoko didn't get a choice when you ripped her dreams away from her!
You should know better than anyone just how painful it is to give up your dream!
How dare you\u2014
Arrgh! Just shut your mouth already!
You and your idiot friend... You women know nothing about dreams!
All you women that destroyed my life better prepare to be used, humiliated, and have everything stolen from you.
Because that's exactly what you deserve!
Keep on throwing away your humanity like that and you'll have nothing left.
Hoohoo, just as I thought.
I won't give up anymore!
I won't let you take anything else away from me!
Looks like you've remembered.
Every piece of yourself you'd kept buried in the darkest depths of the sea.
Your radiant will, your boundless freedom, the compass that guides you toward your dreams...
It is time to recover what's been lost. Take back what's been stolen.
Now let us embark on life anew. I am thou...
...And thou art... I!
What are you staring at!? Load the next ball! Now!
I-I'm leaving you in charge! Punish those intruders nice and good! You hear me!?
With this power I can send Kiuchi flying and avenge Tomoko... Get ready for a double play!
Let's join her!
You know how to fight, right? I'll follow your lead! Show me how to take them down!
Thanks!
We did it...
Wha\u2014 What!?
What is this!?
Hey, since when was I wearing this outfit?
H-Hold on a sec... I feel like all my energy is...
The rebound from your Persona awakening is causing fatigue. We'd best return to the real world for now.
What's a Persona?
You mean that thing that came out of me before? Calling itself Awilda...? You know what that is?
You want many answers.
A splendid thing to desire, truly. But do remember we're still in the middle of a Palace.
Wonder, let's head back to the real world.
I want to secure both Motoha Arai's safety and some time in which to provide her with an explanation.
I can keep going... Let's get Kiuchi and\u2014
*pant* Actually... let's go with... your plan...
Get in.
{NAME1}-kun, truth is...
I'm starving...
The Metaverse, cognitions, Palaces, and Kiuchi's Shadow... Right.
You seem to have picked it all up quite quickly. Were you even shaken when you got lost in the Metaverse?
Not really... It was more like I thought it was all a dream.
But I used the Metaverse Navigator, went to the Palace, and saw everything with my own eyes...
Now I'm here talking to an owl. I'm just rolling with it at this point.
Don't think I forgot about you calling me a ghost.
Oh, Lufel, I didn't know you were the type to hold a grudge. Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers!
By the way, Kiuchi's Palace being a baseball stadium...
Once you said it was linked to his desires, I immediately saw the connection.
Do you think you're ready to talk about what happened with him?
I think you already know bits and pieces of it, but I'll explain.
Takeyuki Kiuchi is a former baseball player.
Until a few years ago he was this incredible,\nfiery rookie that everyone said was destined\nfor greatness in the major leagues.
Back when I used to play... I always thought he was so cool...
Oh, we have to talk about that! Total misogynist creep, right!?
Well, that and... "Bizarre" isn't quite the right word... I suppose you could say he laid his desires bare for all to see.
There are other Shadows of people that exist within Mementos besides Kiuchi.
But his is the first I've ever seen with its own Palace, and so deeply infected by desire I might add.
That's exactly why we have to change his heart. Especially since the real Kiuchi shows no signs of stopping on his own.
So, what you were saying at lunch, about how\nwe're supposed to change Kiuchi's heart...\nI think I got the gist of it, but...
Basically we have to steal his Treasure, right? What will happen to him after that?
I've yet to explain that bit to {NAME2}-kun too. Now's as good a time as any.
First, his distorted desires will dissipate, but the memories of his crimes will remain.
Unable to bear the weight of that reality, the Palace's ruler will confess his wrongdoings by his own will.
So then, Kiuchi will admit what he did to Tomoko?
He will confess to everything. Without exception.
Really... So Tomoko will\u2014!
However, that does not mean the desires he stole from others will return to their rightful owners.
All those people will have to recover by their own strength. Tomoko included.
So we can't take everything back with just the change of heart. Okay, well, this time it's my turn to be there for Tomoko.
Speaking of, we really need to stop Kiuchi as soon as possible. Before someone else gets hurt as badly as she did.
Steady now. We just had a rather precarious encounter with those Shadows back in the Metaverse.
By now the Palace's security has certainly tightened, and it will take time for us to come up with a plan of action.
Since the incident with Tomoko happened so recently, Kiuchi will likely be more cautious.
Therefore, now is not the time to be hasty. If we take a misstep, it's all over.
Right... Yeah, that's a good call, Lufel.
Gotta keep my head cool, and my drive fierce...*exhale* I'm cool.
You seem rather... excitable when you're around him...
I want to become a Phantom Thief.
If the world refuses to bring Kiuchi's actions under scrutiny...
Then I'll make Kiuchi face up to it himself.
It seems like there's no way to stop him from the real world.
But maybe I can stop him from the Metaverse, as a Phantom Thief.
So let's do this!
You're strong and determined. No objections here. You are welcome to join.
Now that's decided, we'll need to think of a code name for you, Motoha Arai.
You can just call me Motoha! The full name's a bit too formal. And {NAME1}-kun, I'll call you by your first name from now on.
Why do we need code names anyway?
It's a name we use to disguise our identities in the Metaverse.
Sounds official. What are your names?
Mine is Cattle. {NAME2}-kun's is Wonder.
Those have kind of a fantastical vibe to them. I'll go with something in that vein...
Okay... What's something that sounds mysterious...?
Ooh, how about "Closer"? That's what they call the pitcher that comes in to finish a baseball game.
Some people also say "Stopper."
Is it cool to pick my own name? I just think it sounds enigmatic.
And it could also mean like, "We're the last stand against Kiuchi!" Kinda nice, right?
Fine by me! It's your code name after all. If you know what you want to be called, all the better.
Oh right, we should get each other's contact info.
Got it.
I should probably get going. Talk to you guys later!
We should head home as well.
You ready to go?
You said it's a shop, correct? What kind of shop?
You'll see!
A shop that could aid our Palace\ninfiltration plan? Hoohoo, sounds like it\nshould prove worthwhile.
Okay, so we go straight down here...\nthen take a left... and it should be\naround there. Follow me!
That's right! We're gonna need weapons and stuff, right?
Oh, but I guess they don't sell any real guns...
Actually, a model gun or sword will be plenty. Remember how the Metaverse runs on cognitions?
So long as the enemy thinks our weapons are real, they'll function in the same way real ones do.
That means even a toy gun has the potential to be a deadly weapon.
Really!? Man, the cognitive world's nuts.
'Sup.
He's kind of brusque... Oh, whatever.
I've never set foot in a place like this before. I don't even know where to start...
And I'm not sure my allowance will cover it...
If we're looking to broaden our range of battle tactics, firearms are the way to go.
Okay, firearms... Where are the firearms...?
H-Huh?
You both don't look like military buffs to me.
I find you especially suspicious, little lady.
"Little lady"?
You kids gonna run around with my goods and make trouble for me?
Oh crap! I heard rumors this guy was shady!
You could've said that before we came in here...
Give me answers. Tell me why you came here.
What th\u2014!? I mean... You've got that right!
Don't see many types like you these days...
I'm not gonna ask for specifics, but long as you're not looking to fill some sad sack with lead, that's good enough for me.
Take it.
Sorry for callin' you little lady. I'll give you something special.
Really? For free?
To make up for being too suspicious of you.
Just don't go causing a scene and make\nthings... difficult for me or my customers.
Come again.
Welp, we got ourselves an arms dealer.
Sharing intel, succeeding in missions... We're really starting to feel like a proper cohort.
Cohort? That sounds super old, Lufel.
Oh... Is that right?
We're phantom thieves, so let's just call ourselves "The Phantom Thieves," yeah?
The Phantom Thieves, huh? Not bad.
No objections here.
A leader has to manage their team members, right? I would prefer to focus on myself.
Then it's settled. Congrats, Leader! Any words of inspiration for us?
Ooh, nice energy! I like it.
Really?
Someone's not good at thinking on the spot...
As long as we get the job done, I will allow you to dictate the pace.
With the Phantom Thieves on my side, I should be able to accomplish my goal as well... Heheheh.
Anyway, what should we do next?
Okay then, let's call it a day for now.
The weapons we got came with instructions, so I'll make sure to read up on those.
Oh, and make sure to let me know when you wanna go into the Metaverse. I'll rush right over. See you later!
So, Leader, from here on you're not living just for yourself anymore.
Your choices are going to affect me and Motoha as well.
We'll be counting on you to be even more upstanding than you have been thus far.
Well, as the founder of the group, I don't mind giving you a bit more direction.
First off, would you say you're doing well financially?
Ah, that's right. You do live in a rather lavish home.
But this will be a good opportunity. You ought to learn how to earn money for yourself.
That won't do. An empty wallet's bound to hinder our work as Phantom Thieves.
I see. So you don't have an excess of wealth at your disposal?
Let's get you a part time job so you can start saving up.
It sounds like a job is just what you need to whip your attitude into shape.
Don't worry, I already have a job in mind. In the worst-case scenario, I will be there to pick up the pieces.
I saw a help wanted sign in the window of a nearby convenience store.
Let's head over there now.
Well done. Now you're able to make money on your own.
Good for you.
I mean it. You're brimming with confidence. From my perspective at least.
Hoohoo! Bursting with desire as ever. I knew you were a dependable leader.
Now, on to the next bit of training.
Cultivating your knowledge and intelligence will be critical to our work as Phantom Thieves. We must refine ourselves.
And you are a student after all.
Now that you're living a double life, you'll have to learn to study more efficiently.
They have a pleasant atmosphere, and there happens to be one right nearby.
You should try studying there.
Nice work. You've found a good way to maintain your devotion to your studies.
Seems like we still have some time before night settles in.
This is a good opportunity. Moving forward,\nyou will assume control of our activities.
We'll be trusting you to make decisions as\nteam leader after all. I'll go along with\nwhatever you decide. Do as you please.
Of course going straight home is also a valid option.
Well then, I will make myself at home. If you\nwant to craft infiltration tools, give me a\nhoot and I will provide guidance.
Let's take our time exploring this area.
From here, you can return to Shibuya.
You can continue exploring Mementos as it is. I'll leave it up to you whether to withdraw or not.
To ensure the operation goes smoothly, we need to investigate the Palace.
Once you're ready, we'll head back to the palace.
I've arranged a special training for you tomorrow. We'll be going to Mementos.
It's going to be quite tough, so make sure to rest well today.
Will you use your free time for reading or studying?
If it's a quiet and calm place, you can study and read efficiently.
Hmm... Your house seems to have a suitable place for either.
Perhaps now we are able to advance?
Time is limited. Make a careful plan and spend your days wisely.
Maybe you could do some physical training there.
Why not tidy up your room for a change of pace?
Spending time in a clean room feels good, don't you think?
I heard something a bit unusual.
There's a tabby cat in Zoshigaya. I've heard it behaves somewhat strangely.
Though I'm not sure what they mean by "strange"...
Perhaps we should look for it and find out?
I heard there's a popular movie out.
I heard there's a nice caf\xe9 in Yongen-Jaya. You could stop by if you want a break.
By the way, I also saw some sort of fundraising drive in front of Shibuya Station. I wonder what their goal is...
I remember you had some video games in your room.
It's quite amusing to watch you play them. Show me again when you have time.
It seems we can't proceed from here. Let's look for another route.
Perfect timing. Let's test the power we just acquired on that Shadow over there.
The power of the wave seems quite weak, but \nit might be enough to open the door from \nearlier.
To proceed further, it seems we need to collect more of these objects.
For now, try using it on the door from earlier.
No problem. I sense a presence nearby.
The Shadow ahead has a peculiar presence...
I sense something from within its form. It appears to have amassed human desire within itself...
This is just my guess, but did it swallow a stack of tickets...?
There seems to be something on the ground\nover there...
It's a safe room.
It's also a good idea to prepare yourself before moving forward.
This door doesn't look like it opens.
Let's look for the Shadow with the ticket.
With this ticket, it looks like we can open the door from earlier.
Let's head back and give it a try.
It seems we're getting close to the Treasure...
The Shadow guarding this place looks quite formidable.
Let's give it everything we've got.
You little brat! Don't you dare defy Kiuchi-sama!
Ugh... That was a powerful blow. We must do something.
Strange... The attack didn't hit...?
This one seems to have some kind of special power... I'll look into it, so wait a moment.
I am always training for Kiuchi-sama! You guys are no match for me!
It's readying a powerful strike. Brace yourself!
I'll crush anyone who dares to defy Kiuchi-sama!
This seems bad...
Very well, leave it to me!
Huh... Did the enemy's movements slow down?
No way, my love for Kiuchi-sama can't be in vain!
Amazing!
Hehe, I just disrupted their movements a bit. Now's your chance, go for it!
There are enemies ahead... Be careful.
Following Closer's previous suggestion, I believe it should make the perfect target to test out our new weapons.
What!? How are they so fast!?
A door, and a Shadow guarding it... huh. If we defeat it, the door should open.
It seems we can't go any further from here.
Let us leave for today.
It seems there are no more places to investigate around here.
{NAME2}-kun, you made it. Well, then, let's go.
Follow me.
Morning... *yawn*
The weapon's manual was suuuper long. I fell asleep reading it. Kinda messed up my neck.
We're probably gonna start having more expenses soon, huh? Guess I should think about getting a job...
I'm Ms. Taniyama. I'll be your world history\nteacher. I hope you're as excited to learn\nas I am to teach you all.
But I still wanna have free time to chill out and go to the movies and stuff.
Oh, and we can't forget we're students before\nanything else. We've gotta study and... Ugh!\nThere's just not enough time in the day!
Well, I guess I should figure out how I'm gonna spend my time after school from now on.
I'll make sure to be on standby for when you decide we're going to the Metaverse.
All right everyone, let's continue our lesson on the French Revolution.
Now remember how a despot's legacy will change depending on whether or not they have the support of the masses?
Sort of tangential to that, there are many examples of thieves from that era who've come to be viewed as heroes.
Perhaps you've heard them referred to as\n"chivalrous thieves"?
Now today's forecast looks to be cloudy with a chance of... {PLAYER_NAME}-san! See if you can answer this question.
Which of these people is the thief who inspired Slovakia's Robin Hood?
Well, I suppose they're still not very well known in Japan.
The answer is Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk.
That's right. Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk.
He only targeted wealthy elites who caused suffering for the masses. Then he would give his bounty to the poor.
Stories of his deeds were praised and passed along by the people, who even erected a statue in his honor.
A thief who fought against the avarice of man...
Sounds a little like us, does it not? Hoohoo.
I'm headed to the library, but if you wanna go to the Metaverse, just let me know, 'kay?
I'm trying to find an effective training method, so I thought I'd look it up.
If I find a book that's useful, I'm gonna check it out.
I was thinking about this during class, but...
Ever since we started fighting, I've realized my body is kinda weak and sluggish.
For Tomoko's sake, we can't afford to lose, so I figured I should do what I can to get stronger.
Then I thought, maybe I could study and train at the same time... but I'm not sure how that would work, haha. So, library it is.
I'm kinda nervous being back here... Oh yeah, we gotta use code names, right? Wonder and Cattle, was it?
Precisely, Closer.
There's a Shadow just ahead.
Let's use the weapons Iwai-san gave us!
Remember what I told you about enemy\nweaknesses? These Shadows are weak\nto guns. Use that to knock them down.
That means fighting with guns will give us\nthe advantage!
Wonder, we need to hit each enemy in its weakness. Give us your orders.
Woohoo! Teamwork makes the dream work! Who knew victory could be so intoxicating?
Oh yeah. Now that I think of it, I don't know what intoxication feels like in the first place, hahaha.
But launching a coordinated attack like that was awesome. Kinda takes me back to my baseball days.
I do feel that we're really starting to live up to the Phantom Thieves' name.
But Closer, you executed your attack slightly too late.
Huh? Seriously? Maaan... I guess I'm still not used to fighting yet.
You seem to have found a place for yourself in your world.
Master is referring to your role in the Phantom Thieves.
Deepening your bonds with others will profoundly influence the strength of your heart, that of your Persona.
Whether these bonds of yours will stave off the coming ruin... or be the primary catalyst for chaos...
Heheh. That lies in your own hands.
I think he is ready to handle it now.
Just as the interactions between you and\nother embracers of desire synthesize\ninto bonds...
Think of this as a synthesis between pieces\nof yourself. Personas are the personalities\nwithin you that embrace desire.
By the synthesis of these personalities through Fusion, a new personality is born.
The wild card... it is an ability unique to you. However...
The creation of a new Persona through Fusion\nalso constitutes the dissolution of your bond\nwith your old Personas.
Now then, once again.
Allow me to welcome you back to the Velvet Room.
You think so too, right, Wonder?
Huh? You weren't listening?
You were staring into space again. Is that a habit of yours?
Right... Let me just fill you in on our discussion.
We were saying that from now on, as leader of the Phantom Thieves, you should command us in the field and in battle.
And now with our All-Out Attack, we have the\npotential to deal heavy damage to\npowerful enemies.
We should make use of it when the time is\nright. So, should we head to Kiuchi's\nPalace now?
Oh, but didn't you say security would tighten since we were found out last time?
That is correct. Furthermore, Closer is still not used to combat.
Perhaps it'd be best to battle with enemies in Mementos until you find your footing.
I'm not a Metaverse expert by any means, but it seems like a suitable place for gathering experience.
But if you want to head straight for the Palace, that's fine as well. If so, I'll give you a lift.
The decision is yours, Wonder.
Huh? This feeling...
Everything OK?
There's a safe room here. Let's use it.
What's a safe room?
Something about this place feels different.
This is a room where the Palace's distortion is weaker. That means we're able to rest here safely. Hence, Safe Room.
Ahh, I see, so it's like making it safely to base!
Maybe I'll take a rest for a bit. I am actually pretty tired.
So, Cattle, you really know a lot of stuff about the Metaverse and Palaces, huh?
I haven't had the chance to ask you until now, but what exactly is your goal?
Well, you see...
Oh? I'm listening...
I don't know.
Y-You don't? How could you not?
As I said before, there is a strong drive within me that believes humans should embrace desire...
But somehow, it seems the better part of my memories vanished when I entered the real world.
But I do think I know a way to bring my memories back. Namely, taking the Palace's Treasure.
Then let's get that Treasure from Kiuchi ASAP and bring your memories back!
Right, Wonder?
Hm, are you okay, Cattle?
Usually this is where you'd would say something like, "Hoohoo! What stupendous desire!"
I do not talk like that!
Well, anyway, I was just thinking... You two seem very trusting of me, but...
As humans, is it really okay for you to accept a mysterious being like me into the fold so easily?
What? Of course it is! If you weren't around...
Wonder and I would be desireless, and not to mention pummeled by Shadows.
Heheh. So if anything, you're more like our guardian angel.
I-I see...
Well if you two say so, then I'm prepared to give my all to the Phantom Thieves.
And to accomplishing all of our goals.
All right! Happy to have you aboard, Lufel!
Oh! This is kind of like give and take, right? Wow, we really are like phantom thieves!
Not "like" them, we are Phantom Thieves. Also, my name is Cattle here.
Ah, sorry! Forgot about the code names, hahaha...
Wait, is this...?
Yes. This is where we were shown the videos of Kiuchi's past.
Looking back, he probably intended to manipulate Closer by making her remember past trauma.
Yeah! Boy, it makes me mad just thinking\nabout it. Let's go snatch that Treasure from\nKiuchi right now!
I can't. I'm being called to another table...
Hm? That voice... Is it another video from Kiuchi's past?
Wait, sorry...
I think I need to see it.
I know I decided to stop ignoring my self and my desires, but...
I think I need to come to grips with what happened in Kiuchi's past first.
I can't ignore the fact that I'm part of the reason things turned out this way.
I see. Your resolve is quite noble.
So this video's probably from the time after Kiuchi was reprimanded by the club about his slump.
And it takes place in... a club?
Nooo, don't go Rimi-chaaan. Don't ignore meee.
I'll be right back.
Ugh!
Rimi-chaaan!
Damn it!
So Kiuchi-san, now that Rimi-chan's gone...
You think we can get started with the interview now?
You must have practice tomorrow too, so...
Practice?
Who d'ya think yer talkin' to? I'm Kiuchiii. Future Major League All-Star Ki-u-chi!
I can miss one lousy practice!
Hey! My cup's empty! And get more girls over here!
Man, he's even worse than people say.
We should leak this story as a special feature before he gets to the majors.
Blegh.
I know I chose to watch this, but now I wish I hadn't.
Man, I guess I now know why they say you should never meet your heroes.
I wouldn't call it a crush, more like admiration as a fellow baseball player.
I just looked up to him. Plus, we came from the same hometown.
But his ugly side\u2014or I guess I should say, his real personality\u2014is something else...
I see you're having a wistful moment here, but we should keep moving.
We're pretty far in the Palace now. The Treasure is bound to be nearby.
'Kay. I doubt that was the last video there is either, so let's go.
You'll be asked to hang up your uniform for this.
Hm, seems like Kiuchi's past is playing here as well. This must be a continuation of the story.
Can we watch it?
You're supposed to be an upstanding athlete. And yet here you are sucking face in public.
The article even suggests you forced the girl into it. Is that true?
What!? No, it's not... Probably.
Thanks to you, everyone in the club is having to field complaints left and right.
Now I'm hearing all kinds of other unsavory rumors about you.
Coach, back me up here. This kind of conduct is indefensible, am I wrong?
You're right. There's no way around it.
Coach...
Sorry, pal.
Look, I know you've put in a lot of effort over the years.
B-But... what about the majors!? I've already started the process of getting my passport and\u2014
Canceled. Over. Your performance is still lackluster as ever anyhow.
Instead of worrying about that, I suggest you start thinking about your next career path.
I... I can't play baseball anymore...?
I understand how much you've contributed to the organization up till now.
I am also aware that being an athlete is not exactly a transferable skill.
The sales team is looking for people, if you'd like me to pass your name on.
*sniffle* *sob*
Oh, get a grip! You're a grown man. Stop acting so pathetic.
We've even arranged to buy the public's sympathy by revealing the "cause" of your unraveling through media outlets.
They're going to say that after you volunteered at that baseball clinic...
...you "hid the fact you got injured trying to catch the batter's hit."
The baseball... clinic...
So what's it gonna be? You want me to cancel\nthe press and the sales position?
You'll be left unemployed and publicly hated, but...
I'll... take the job...
Why did this happen to me?
Beat by a grade-school girl... Betrayed\nby some escort...
This is their fault... Those sinister, vile women... They did this to me!
I'll show them... I'll show them all what it's like to be chewed up and spat out!
I won't give them a chance to fight back, or call for help... I'll make them see who's really in charge!
So Kiuchi's perversion toward women drives his desire for revenge, causing his Shadow to run amok.
And in the real world, it causes him to terrorize them as the Subway Slammer.
Hmph. What an incontrovertibly self-serving, egoistic desire. Punishing women for problems he created himself.
For so long... I agonized over what happened at that baseball clinic.
When I heard from those tabloids that Kiuchi got hurt because of me... I was completely depressed.
I tortured myself... Hated myself. Threw away my reason for living along with my dreams...
And for what!?
A sob story made up by the press!?
Ah, so he solicited the public's sympathy for an injury that turned out to be fake...
Are you fucking kidding me!?
After all the guilt those news stories made me feel...!
I went through so much pain, I gave up everything that was important to me in my life!
And yet? He's running around abusing women!? With his chickenshit shoving tactics!
Just so he can lord over them and feel in control or some bullshit. Who does he think he is!?
O-Oh...
I'll never forgive him for this!
He's going to pay for every single person he's victimized. I'll make sure of it!
A desire strong enough to move not just oneself, but others as well, hm?
That's the thing I admire most about humans. Count me in.
We're pretty far in now, huh?
Something about this area is extra disturbing.
This is the place. There's no mistaking it... The Treasure is here.
But where though...? Is it only visible to you?
We'll need the Palace's ruler to do that for us.
What...?
We're still in Kiuchi's domain. I want to avoid the enemy overhearing our plan.
We should return to the real world. We can discuss our next move there.
So, Lufel, this materialization thing you're talking about... How are we supposed to do that?
As the core of the ruler's desire, the Treasure is one factor that contributes to their Shadow running rampant.
However, if the real Kiuchi doesn't think his Treasure can be stolen, it will not materialize in the Metaverse.
Therefore, we need to give him a reason to fear that his Treasure is at risk of being swindled.
We need to announce to the real Kiuchi that we plan to steal his corrupted desire.
Once we do, the Treasure will appear in the Metaverse.
So... We just need to tell him to his face?
Well, remember we're Phantom Thieves. I'd prefer to keep our true identities under wraps.
What's more, it's possible confronting Kiuchi directly could set him off into a frenzy.
Hoom, a calling card, huh?
Love it! It'll protect our identities, and it's super Phantom Thief vibes.
Agreed. Fighting evil from the cover of shadow. A phantom thief's greatest skill.
But before we issue the calling card, there's something I need to confirm with you two.
Causing a change of heart is a risky act that forcibly reshapes the target's mind.
If we destroy his Shadow completely by mistake, there's a chance the real Kiuchi could die.
With that knowledge, do you still want to proceed?
Um...
Yeah, I agree.
Of course I won't forgive what he's done, but stealing his desire outright means we're no better than him.
And the fact that one misstep by us could kill him... The thought alone freaks me out.
I have a proposition. As is customary among humans, dire deliberations such as this should be made by unanimous decision.
Unanimous decision?
Indeed.
With anything less than the approval of every member, we do nothing.
It's not left up to the leader, or the majority. If just one person opposes, a unanimous decision cannot be made.
In accomplishing matters of grave importance, a singular, unified heart is a sine qua non.
You're right. We can't stoop to Kiuchi's level.
But I have no idea what "cynic one on" means.
What do you think, {NAME2}? Should we do it?
Um, I also have a suggestion...
Since Tomoko's the one that got injured, how about asking her what she thinks?
Of course we'll leave out the Phantom Thieves part.
Good idea. Let's head to the station once our preparations are in order.
Hang on. This is the right room, but...
Would you two mind waiting out here?
Would you want someone staring at you while you're all banged and bruised up? Motoha is being considerate by keeping you out.
Sorry, {NAME2}.
Tomoko, it's me, Motoha. I'm coming in.
They said I can never play again.
My dream... it's over.
The cops came earlier, but...
They said they can't arrest him unless they catch him in the act.
I-It'll be okay, Tomoko. Don't give up. Everything is going to get better, I promise you.
Your injuries will heal, and the attacker will be cau\u2014
No... They won't.
What am I supposed to live for now?
I'm going to come visit you every day! So please don't\u2014
You don't have to. I don't want you to see me like this.
I'm sorry... Motoha.
I just\u2014there's no point anymore... to anything...
Just hold on, Tomoko. I promise you, I'll make him pay.
It seems Tomoko's hope has been stolen.
If we don't take care of Kiuchi, people like her will continue having their will to live stripped away from them.
I've made up my mind. We have to change Kiuchi's heart.
Are you guys with me?
I am on board as well. And with that, we've reached a unanimous decision.
So, who's going to write the calling card?
I'll do it! I mean, please let me do it.
I'm the one who wants to change his heart the most, so...
Hoohoo, go ahead! Let the strength of that desire feed your creativity.
But just for my own peace of mind, I'll emend any clumsy wording.
Right... And "emend" means... what exactly?
If you're unfamiliar with such vocabulary, I suppose I'll have to thoroughly school you in the basics.
Yes! Please do!
Now the question is, how do we deliver the calling card? We don't know his office or home address.
We know he'll be around Shibuya Station, but we don't know what days or what time.
I can help with that. I've been observing his movements throughout the day up till now.
At the same time every night, Kiuchi exits the station to transfer trains.
Ooh! Nice! So we can give him the calling card then.
Oh, but wait. We have to give it to him in a way that he won't realize it's us, right? How are we supposed to do that?
That's... also the part I'm struggling with.
What do you think, Leader?
Ooh! I know!
What if Lufel flies over the station and scatters a bunch of calling cards everywhere?
H-Hoo!? Me?
Well, yeah. I mean, you're the one who can fly, right?
I'm bound to break a bone carrying this much weight!
It's highly improbable I would go unnoticed,\nthus jeopardizing the Phantom Thieves'\nname along with my physical well-being.
Come on, what are you worried about? This is the best way to guarantee Kiuchi gets the message!
Very well... This is our first mission after all.
I suppose we might as well make a statement\nand let the world know who the Subway Slammer\nreally is.
I'll come up with a design for the card. Let everyone have a taste of the Metaverse's rakish charm.
But we must be careful. The calling card will\nonly reveal the Treasure for a day.\nThat means, once we send it...
We'll have to steal the Treasure that day.\nWe can build up our experience in Mementos\nfirst. Let me know when you're ready.
Are you ready? Once the calling card is sent, there's no turning back.
In other words, we can't return until we've made Kiuchi have a change of heart.
If we need to do any shopping, we should get it done before we go. So, are you ready to send the calling card?
Understood. We make our move tonight.
Understood. Once you're prepared, give me a hoot.
"Sir Takeyuki Kiuchi, former baseball player, sinner of lust, known today as the Subway Slammer."
"You have assaulted countless women at the station with outrageous acts of violence."
"You are a coward who preys on the unsuspecting and defenseless, stealing their hopes away from them."
"We, the Phantom Thieves, will take your twisted desires without fail."
What the hell is this!?
The Phantom Thieves? Who the hell\u2014!? They even wrote my name!
Kiuchi? Oh, there was some player with that name.
I remember that guy. He has a long, oval-shaped head and...
Wait, isn't that him right there?
Get out of my way, idiots!
"The Phantom Thieves," huh? You think you can steal from me!?
Yeah, right! Like you could! If I lost that, I'd...!
All right, Kiuchi definitely saw the calling card. The Treasure should have materialized now.
There's no turning back now. Let's enter Mementos.
Before we steal Kiuchi's Treasure, let's make sure we're all on the same page.
My memories are not 100% clear, so this will\nborder on\u2014if not surpass\u2014speculation, but...
There is a possibility that once we steal the root of Kiuchi's desire, meaning the Treasure, his Palace will disappear.
Disappear? So, after we steal the Treasure, we can never go back to the Palace?
I've never made a Palace disappear before, so I can't imagine what happens after that.
Is it possible, for one reason or another, that the Palace might appear again?
I can't say for certain one way or the other, but there is a non-zero possibility.
You're right!
First, let's focus all our energy on stealing that Treasure! Kiuchi's bound to put up a fight after all.
As long as we're in agreement about the Palace, it's fine by me. Let's go.
Whoa, it looks so different from last time.
Well, look who it is! The maggots that do their dirty work in the dark!
Wait... is that a ball behind him?
That's it! That's the Treasure!
That's the Treasure? The thing that caused his messed-up desires?
Hey! What are you mumbling over there, huh!?
You saw what happened in my past, yet still don't show an ounce of remorse, do you, Motoha Arai?
You're just a cold-hearted monster of a woman, aren't you?
Look who's talking! The guy who faked an injury from a children's baseball clinic?
All you do is point the finger because you can't face up to your own issues. You're a coward.
You... goddamn brat!
You were a brat back then too. A cheeky little freak running around like you didn't give a damn.
I am Takeyuki Kiuchi! The great Takeyuki Kiuchi-sama!
So why am I stuck being some worthless office worker?
Shut up! What do you brats know about anything!?
Women these days up on their high horses cry\nsexual harassment the second you try to talk\nto them.
And I'm only worth as much as my salary\nto them!
The reason I ended up like this... everything...\nIt's all because of women! Despite the fact\nthey're completely useless without men!
Guess we really have to do it.
Right. But remember, our goal is stealing the Treasure.
To do that we'll have to pin him down first. Are you ready?
We've come this far. Time to end this!
Come and get it, you sticky-mitted rug rats.
The game's not over till you're all crying for mercy!
How do you like these muscles?
I might be retired, but I kept up the training!
Now I'm gonna crush you snot-nosed brats down to size!
Like I said, first we need to impair him. Then, we'll distract him and take the Treasure!
Just be careful not to finish him off, or the real Kiuchi might die.
So just beat the hell out of him, right? Got it!
Agh... You damn\u2014!
It's over. We have no intention of killing you.
Once we take that Treasure from behind you, we'll be on our way.
S-Stop it! That's mine!
Hoohoo, well that makes me want it all the more.
Now! Take the Treasure!
No! You can't!
I won't let you have it!
What is that!?
It's too early to call the game!
This isn't over till the bottom of the ninth. But you won't get a chance at a walk-off home run!
'Cause Cupid's breaking ball's gonna crush everything to dust!
Hahahahaha. You thought you could corner me? Well look who's cornered now!
I'm done going easy on you! Now I'll crush you like the bugs you are!
He's revealed his true form!
But the plan stays the same! Dodge Kiuchi and go for the Treasure!
Woo! I feel as good as I did in my league days. How 'bout a li'l charm 'n' cheer?
Yes! That's it! Shake it for me! Shower me with praise!
Those women are making Kiuchi stronger.
We should consider taking them out first.
Kiuchi's gaining power from those women!
Wonder, prioritizing your targets is critical!
Goddamn it. Women really are useless!
Gahaha! You better give me what I want!
Here comes my strike-stealing, heart-breaking pitch!
Tsk! This is what's wrong with women!
Gahaha! All eyes on me!
I've gotten more money and women with this arm than I can even count!
Someone's always getting in my way!
Hey! Bring me girls! Where are the girls!?
Looks like he's distracted. Now we can steal the Treasure.
Leave it to me.
Take us home, Closer.
Huuuh? One's missing...
This is the Treasure that stole Tomoko's dream away from her!
W-When did you\u2014!?
No! Not that! It's my\u2014!
Haaaayah!
Gaagh!
He went back to his original form?
That means we've stopped his Shadow's frenzy. He doesn't have the power to resist anymore.
What should we do, Wonder?
Ugn!
No! I can't move!
I'm ruined... I can never play again... Just take it.
You may be the enemy, but your attachment to your Treasure... Well, I appreciate the strength of that desire.
This is...
You're going to pay for every single person you've hurt through your crimes.
Heh... Heheh...
My life... It's pathetic. Working a desk job while obsessing over my old baseball career...
I couldn't make anything go right... Then I started doing something that awful...
My life... There's nothing left for me to live for. How am I supposed to go on living...?
Get a grip!
What? You gonna beat me up again? I can't move anymore, and I have no reason to live eith\u2014
No! I'm saying, wake up!
You know what your problem is?
You treat women like they're dolls for you to lord over. But they're not. They're human beings.
You've spent your life taking advantage of as\nmany women as you possibly could, and somehow\nit's their fault your life is crap?
That's bullshit!
What did any of the women you victimized do to you? What did Tomoko ever do to you!?
You have hurt a lot of innocent people. Stolen their hope away from them...
What happened to the Takeyuki Kiuchi that made us all love baseball!?
Don't say you have nothing to live for.
There are a lot of people who discovered their dreams... their reasons for living, because of you.
To them, you were always a hero... a star they looked up to.
Hero...?
What you've done is unforgivable. But that\ndoesn't mean your life is over.
As long as you're alive, no matter what shape that life takes, your hopes, your dreams, will never die.
But... there's no way I can go back to being a pro...
Is that really... your only dream?
Before your whole fixation on women, why did you start playing baseball in the first place?
Because... I loved it.
I used to play in the park as a kid. Everyone would praise me for my good plays.
Then when the girl I liked finally talked to me... That's when I got into this messed up mindset...
For once in my life, things were going well for me... and I saw a new reason to live.
So you really did start out with a love for baseball...
Then you can rebuild that dream again.
After you atone for your crimes, and reflect on what you've done...
What about becoming a little league coach, and helping kids achieve their baseball dreams?
To make up for all the hopes you crushed as the Subway Slammer, you should inspire dreams in as many people as possible.
I... can't. I don't have the skill to teach any\u2014
You can.
You were the one who gave me my dream.
Really...? How did I get so turned around?
This feeling... I'm going to make sure I...
He vanished? What about the change of heart? Cattle?
This is supposed to be Kiuchi's desire? What does it mean?
What's happening!?
Grab the Treasure and run!
Now that we've taken its source of power, the Palace is going to disappear!
Seriously!? Okay! Wonder, grab that end! Wait, is this even gonna fit inside... Cattle?
I appreciate your desire for Treasure, but... just watch the upholstery.
Phew! We made it.
Where's the Treasure!?
Here.
That looks nothing like what we took from the Palace.
This was the origin of Kiuchi's corrupted desires.
In the Palace, Kiuchi's cognition interpreted\nit as a trophy to cherish. Now it's out here,\nit has returned to its original form.
So his love for baseball, his lust for women, and his resentment against them...
...all started with this ball.
Thanks. You and Lufel were great too!
I really hope that with this, we can make Tomoko feel better. Even if it's just a little bit.
Uh... I wouldn't say cool. If anything, it felt like I was lecturing him...
But I'm glad I came across like that. Thank you.
L-Lunch was ages ago! And we've been running around a lot.
In that case, how about a celebratory dinner? There's some information I want to share with you two as well.
I have great confidence in Motoha's choice of dining establishments. Let's go.
Hey, look! That's...!
He asked someone to call the cops on him?
Wait, isn't that the ex-baseball player Kiuchi?
So the Subway Slammer Menace... was him?
It appears the change of heart was successful.
So... he turned himself in because we changed his heart?
Yes. Only the memories of his crimes remain.\nHe'll likely confess to everything, including\nhis misdeeds as the Subway Slammer.
I was thinking... I mean, of course his actions were unforgiveable, but...
I'm just glad it didn't go any further than it did, you know?
Ahahahahahahaha!
I... I killed them. I'm a murderer!
This is it... There's no turning back now!
Alright, then let's go. The place was in Shinjuku, right, Motoha?
Come on, this way! Follow me.
Hey! You're staring into space again. Motoha's waiting. Let's go.
So this ball was the root of Kiuchi's twisted desires, huh? Seems like the kind of thing anyone would have lying around...
Do you think if we took a wrong turn somewhere, we'd end up corrupt Palace rulers like Kiuchi?
While it's not beyond the realm of possibility, I don't think the two of you have it in you.
By awakening your Personas, you faced the Shadows embodying your desire head-on.
You took Kiuchi's desires and induced his change of heart not for yourselves, but for the sake of others.
By doing so, you safeguarded the hopes and dreams of many, and with it, their will to live.
To imagine that unshakeable goodwill you possess turning to cruelty... Well, frankly I can't.
Hahaha... It makes us sound so cool when you say it like that...
But, yeah. I guess we did do something pretty great, huh?
And it seems you two have an even stronger influence on hope than I initially thought.
The people you've helped, and even Kiuchi, whose heart you changed... they all seem to have renewed desire for life.
Not that a monster like him deserves our compassion in the first place.
You're probably right, but...
Messing up is just part of being human. Obviously Kiuchi's no exception to that... but neither am I.
The choice to throw away hope will always be our own to make. I wanted him to realize that.
But {NAME2} was the one who taught me that! Hahaha.
What, you didn't realize!?
Thanks to you, Tomoko and I can now start moving forward.
Speaking of, are you sure you don't want to share the news with Tomoko Noge?
Um, yeah.
Visiting hours are over for today, so I'm gonna go tell her tomorrow.
Hopefully hearing that the bad guy's been caught will make her feel at least a little bit better.
Oh, by the way, how's your memory, Lufel? Has the Treasure helped you remember anything?
Yes. When I touched Kiuchi's Treasure, my memories came back to me. At least fragments of them did.
Wow! That's great!
Oh, wait. By "fragments" do you mean not all of them came back?
Unfortunately.
I plan to explain in more detail when we discuss the information I have to share with you.
Oh that's right, you said you had something to tell us.
Is it related to what's happening with your memories?
That is correct.
But right now we're in the afterglow of our triumph over Kiuchi. I'd hate to spoil it with what I have to say.
What!? When you say it all ominous like that I feel like I have to know! Right, {NAME2}?
Hoomph. More of that irrepressible curiosity, is it? I suppose I have to tell you then.
Are you for real? I'm the weird one?
Come on, I can't take it! Just clue us in a little.
Precisely.
Wha\u2014 Uh... Wait. So...
There are six more people running around scot-free, wreaking havoc like Kiuchi?
The next station is Shinjuku. The exit will be on...
Um, I guess let's get off the train first.
So uhhh, let's table the Treasure talk for now...
...and head to the restaurant first! I'm sooo hungry.
Soooo hungry!
This is the most motivated I've ever seen you.
I suppose appetite is another form of human desire. On that note, what kind of restaurant are we going to?
It's a ramen shop. Back in little league, I always went there to celebrate after winning a game.
Ah, so that makes it the perfect spot for our celebratory dinner.
Right!? I heard they recently changed their recipe and had a grand reopening! I can't wait to try it!
And since you helped me get justice for Tomoko, today's my treat!
My pleasure! Feel free to go for the large size with extra toppings!
Of course! Feel free to go for the large size with extra toppings!
Toppings? Does that refer to the side foods that complement the main dish?
Yeah! Like boiled eggs, or roasted pork... So how do you like your ramen, {NAME2}?
Hoohoo! A fellow meat lover!
You have good taste... Mmmm... Good choice.
Oooh, a festival of yummy carbs! I like your style, Leader!
Fan of quantity over quality I see. Well, it's still a respectable desire at that.
P-Plain!? We're talking about ramen here!
You may be free to make your own choices,\nbut perhaps you should take a page out of\nMotoha's book when it comes to food.
Aaagh, the more we stand around talking about it the hungrier I get! Let's get this ramen train movin'!
Um! Excuse me!
Your endeavors to seek what you crave\nwill lead to misfortune. I can see it on\nyour faces.
You should go home and head straight to bed!
But we're just on our way to get dinner...
Dinner... A food craving!? It's worse than I thought!
Trying to sate your hunger will only lead to disaster. I see it in your aura.
Whaaat? I'm not sure about all this...
Come on, let's go eat. She's just making broad guesses that could apply to anyone.
I commend the strength of her desire to lure us in, but I suggest we keep moving.
Yeah... I am really starving.
If you don't get a reading you can't protect yourselves! My predictions always come true!
Hahaha... Sorry, we're kinda in a hurry so...
Oh... I see. Forgive me.
I'm closing up for today, but if you ever need a glimpse into the future, I'll be right here.
Farewell then.
We're here! This is it!
Right!? Apparently it's a branch of a popular Chinese restaurant that specializes in ramen.
Lots of young chefs come here to study the art of ramen making.
Wow, you know quite a lot about this place.
Ahaha... What can I say? I love ramen. Well, all food really...
There was a time when their ratings dropped, but word has it that they bounced back with tastier dishes after the reopening.
They certainly seem to be doing well.
Yeah, it's crowded, but looks like a table just opened up! "Misfortune" my foot! This is our lucky day!
Let's go in!
I got the shoyu ramen too! The sign said that one's recommended.
I figured it's probably hard for you to eat noodles, Lufel, so I made sure to get lots of toppings suitable for pecking.
There's boiled eggs and roasted pork too, so I've covered our bases!
Excellent choice.
I would've gotten gyoza too if they had it...
So where did we leave off talking before?
Right, we were discussing the remaining Treasures.
So there're seven Treasures in total, meaning we have six left to find?
I know you two already fulfilled the job I asked of you by stealing Kiuchi's Treasure.
Next course of action? Does that mean you want us to...
So we have to pull some phantom thievery and steal another six Treasures.
I know what you must be thinking. You\nalready put your lives at risk once, and here\nI am asking you to do it six more times.
That's why I wanted to ask you both whether you're willing to continue working as phantom thieves or not.
I guess when we formed the Phantom Thieves, I was so focused on stopping Kiuchi...
...I didn't think about anything beyond the change of heart.
What do you think, {NAME2}? Do you feel equipped to continue the Phantom Thieves?
The world may be losing hope, but it's not going to descend into ruin immediately.
The will to determine that outcome rests with you.
...you would do best to seek other allies of hope, and nurture the desire within your heart.
I certainly have no intention of forcing you into it.
No matter what, staying true to your desires is paramount.
Well, I guess I already accomplished my goal when we changed Kiuchi's heart and avenged Tomoko. But...
Quitting... Giving up the Phantom Thieves...
Two deluxe shoyu ramens! Order up!
I know we're in the middle of an important discussion, but... shall we dig in?
*salivate* All right, agreed. I suppose we can consider this our victory feast.
If I may, I'd first just like to say a few words on behalf of the group...
Let's eat!
Oh well, no matter. You should start eating while it's still hot, {NAME2}.
Hm...?
Huh? I don't remember it tasting like this.
Sorry, just thinking out loud.
It just kind of seems like the flavor is a lot weaker than it was before.
It sort of tastes like... fish broth? Maybe bonito? I can't be sure... It's pretty indistinct.
But, I'm probably just remembering it wrong. It's been a long time since I last had it.
If you two wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a bite to eat myself at some point too, you know.
Oh right, sorry! I guess you can't hold chopsticks.
Hang on... is it okay for owls to eat eggs and stuff?
My appearance is just a disguise to help me blend into this world. Therefore, it has no bearing on what I'm able to eat.
But much like a bird of prey, I'll call the eggs an appetizer...
...to the meaty main course!
Haha... Guess we know what Lufel's favorite is.
Okay, here comes the boiled egg. Open wide!
Ahh! It's hot!
Oh my god! Sorry! Are you guys okay?
Wait... Could this be the "dinner disaster"!?
No...
Masa-san, are you really satisfied with this?
Shun...
Hm? That uniform...
It's nothing like the broth you worked so hard to perfect.
This is not Pops's flavor!
Try to understand, Shun.
I'm not happy about this either.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
Was that... Kano-kun just now?
Kano? An acquaintance of yours?
Looks like he knows the people who run the shop.
Masa-chaaan, baby! How. Are. You?
I'm sorry, it's not closing time yet.
We wrapped filming at our other location ahead of schedule. I know I'm a tad early, but I'm here now, so...
Hey hey hey... Hey hey hey!
Look, I've got places to be. You're not telling me to wait, are you?
Uh... no...
I'm so sorry, everyone. We'll be closing up early today.
Whaaat!?
Hey! That's ridiculous!
I just started eating!
I'm sorry, I truly am. I'll refund you in full.
We look forward to serving you again!
Well this sucks, but I guess we should be going too. The chef's apologizing and everything...
But...! But...!
My meat!
That was really good. Well, the few bites we managed to have were. No wonder Miyazawa gave this place such a great review.
Hmmm... really? I felt like the soup was missing something.
Oh, is that it? Guess you're probably right.
Of course! That guy in there was Hiromu Miyazawa!
You haven't heard of him? Gourmet Food Critic Hiromu Miyazawa? He's on TV all the time.
Ahhh, so approval from a celebrity critic made the shop famous?
Yeah, exactly. He goes by "Katana Tongue" something or other. His palate is said to be unquestionable.
But I don't know, I think the old Victory Kitchen tasted better.
You think so too, huh?
Ah, sorry for butting in.
No, it's cool. Um... You're Kano-kun, right?
I'm Motoha Arai from Class C.
That's Ms. Katayama's class, isn't it?
I've seen you around school a few times too.
Right. My name's Shun Kano. Nice to meet ya.
Uh, you're {PLAYER_NAME}-kun, aren't you?
You're kind of a weird dude, huh? Whatever,\nit's cool. My name's Shun Kano.\nNice to meet ya.
You were talking with the chef before, weren't you? Do you know him or something?
No, not really.
You mentioned the ramen before... What'd you\nreally think of it?
Ummm... If I'm being honest, it was... mediocre.
I remember back when I was a kid, I used to really love the soup, but I wasn't really feeling it this time.
I see... I was afraid you'd say that...
Sorry for asking out of the blue. It's really nothin'.
What? Wait!
He just left... I wonder what that was about.
Aaah! Those measly few bites have only made me feel even hungrier!
Scalded by an egg, kicked out halfway through, meat uneaten I may add...! Some celebration this turned out to be.
And I splashed soup in {NAME2}'s eyes... Sorry, I shouldn't have suggested this place.
I guess that "dinner disaster" fortune turned out to be true.
Let's call it a day. We're all tired, and I'm sure we'll find something to eat at home.
Hmph, all right.
But we are absolutely buying meat on the way back. It is not up for debate!
You're really obsessed, huh?
Oh, and Lufel? About our next job...
Are all Palace rulers bad people?
Bad people willing to step on anyone in\npursuit of their own twisted desires.\nIt's exactly as you said.
And if we steal their Treasures, we can change their hearts?
Based on what happened to Kiuchi it would seem that way. Even I cannot say for sure whether he confessed to the police.
Ah, sorry. Let's actually go home. I didn't mean to rekindle the conversation.
Well, see you tomorrow!
So, shall we head home as well?
I don't know whether you're still interested\nin being a Phantom Thief... but I assume you\ndon't mind if I still stay the night?
Thank you. Apologies for the inconvenience.
Hey. It's Motoha. Sorry to call so late. Can you turn on your TV right now?
It's Kiuchi... he's on the news!
...The arrest was made when Kiuchi, the suspect himself, asked a nearby man to report him to the police.
I'm listening. Yeah, it's that news. I'm watching it too.
The suspect claims in his statement to the police...
...that he "felt as if the evil in his heart was suddenly lifted away."
Unable to bear the weight of his own conscience, Kiuchi confessed to further offenses.
It's exactly like Lufel said. This is the change of heart.
Here is a comment from one of the victims.
There's nothing you can do to protect yourself from a sudden attack like that. I felt completely powerless.
But knowing that from tomorrow, I can step foot in the station without that hanging over me... makes me so relieved.
Feels great to hear that we managed to have such an impact on someone we don't even know.
Right now, there are more bad people out there like Kiuchi going ignored by police...
And there are others like Tomoko and the girl\non TV, who go through all that suffering only\nto think giving up is the only option.
But if the Phantom Thieves were to do something... No. The Phantom Thieves are the only ones who can do something.
That's exactly right.
We can recover the hopes of victims being exploited by these outrageous acts.
Now, with regard to the documents reportedly\nscattered above Shibuya Station and signed\nby the so-called "Phantom Thieves..."
Ah! Are they talking about the calling cards!?
The documents in question expressed an\nintention to "steal the suspect Kiuchi's\ndesires," leading police to believe...
...they held a connection to the ongoing case.\nHowever, based on eyewitness reports that the\ndocuments were dropped by a wild bird...
...police have ruled them out as having any connection to the case at hand, calling it a "random occurrence."
What? They think a wild bird just happened to... That's insane.
Witnesses? I was too careless.
I'll be more careful next ti\u2014 Oh, wait.
I still don't know if there'll be a next time for you two...
Hey, Lufel? I know this incident was written off as a coincidence...
But if the Phantom Thieves become well-known, would that mean we could save more people?
Right. The number of victims would certainly\ndecrease for starters. And if Menaces began\nto fear the Phantom Thieves...
...they'll cease acting on their twisted impulses and this problem will finally come to an end.
Oh! Yeah, that could work.
What do you think, {NAME2}? Should we continue the Phantom Thieves?
Yeah, I knew you'd say that!
Average students by day, phantom thieves\ndefending desire by night.
Sounds pretty cool when you put it like that, huh!? Like we're making the world a better place.
Ahhh... Anyway, it's getting late, so I'll leave you with this...
Let's do this thing!
R-Right...
Ah! Sorry, was that too loud? Eheheh... Sorry to make a racket! 'Night!
That Motoha... If this were the Metaverse we'd be up to our beaks in enemies right now.
But, for a person to be as willing to face danger head-on as she...
Perhaps this world isn't quite as hopeless as we'd imagined...
Um, never mind, sorry. I'm still having difficulty parsing my returning memories.
Anyway, {NAME2}. As members of the Phantom Thieves, I look forward to completing our next job together.
But to think I was spotted distributing the calling cards...
I fear my presence could risk unmasking your identity as a phantom thief.
We'll need to think of a new method for delivering the next calling card.
Mmmm, this bonito broth is second to none. This is the true taste of Victory Kitchen.
A light soup that packs a punch with its refined, citrusy aftertaste!
It'll leave your tastebuds begging for more with every sip!
I'm sure you all remember the time when this shop was in crisis.
The founder, affectionately known as Pops,\nfell very ill... Ever since, the quality of\ntheir flavor has dropped significantly.
But then! I, Katana Tongue Miyazawa, whipped this place into shape!
Oh, the number of bad reviews I had to give them. But of course, I did so with the good of Victory Kitchen in mind.
Though some people out there like to call me a "Menace" for it.
But I don't mind playing the villain if it means protecting true flavor!
And it seems my feelings finally got through\nto them, as I eventually earned the\nwholehearted support of the young chefs!
We worked together to revive the broth to its\noriginal\u2014 No. We've surpassed the old flavor\nto reach new heights of excellence!
Ahhh, remembering all this makes me so emotional... The soup seems somehow saltier than usual, hahah.
That's all for tonight's Stupidly Honest\nReview with Miyazawa-kun, where I tell ya the\nwho's who and what's what in food biz.
Brought to you from Victory Kitchen. With the\nmight of my pen, I cut through bad taste\ncleaner than any sword!
This is Katana Tongue Miyazawa signing off. G'night, everybody!
Okay, that's a wrap!
Excellent work, Miyazawa-san!
Ugh, putting on that stupid act is\nexhausting. Tomorrow's that hole-in-the-wall\nChinese food place, right?
Ahhh yes. The main shop Victory Kitchen branched off from... Pops's place.
Since Pops got sick, it seems the part-time staff are struggling to keep the business afloat...
But that doesn't mean I should pull any punches. After all, it has nothing to do with flavor, right?
Uh oh! I wonder if I'll be called a Menace again. It is so hard being a popular, straight-shooting gourmet critic.
What, Masa-kun? You look like you have something to say.
How about we see some appreciation first, huh?
That's right! Let's preserve the integrity of Victory Kitchen together.
Please, enough is enough.
I can't stand lying to our customers like this...
Excuse me? Did I hear that correctly?
Using my bonito flakes has cut down your expenses and labor costs.
And thanks to promotion by me, this place has been crawling with customers! Everyone's raving about the taste!
B-But, Pops's flavor requires authentic bonito flakes grated by hand with a shaver box...
Shaver box!? You don't need those stinky old cheese graters!
The customers are clearly satisfied with my\nbudget bonito flakes. So what is it really?
Dying for another one of my scathing reviews\nto cut your little shop down to size till it\ngoes under for good?
N-No, I...
By the way...
I thought you made sure to fire that little rat who splashed water in my face, didn't you?
And yet, he passed right by me when I walked in here. Don't tell me you're letting him come and go as he pleases?
Anyone's allowed as a customer.
Hmph... Well, whatever.
But you should be careful. 'Cause your entire shop's riding on you keeping me a happy camper. Got it?
Ah, you're up. You have school today, don't you? I'll be waiting downstairs.
Are you heading to school? I shall be\nwaiting downstairs.
Good morning! It's morning there, isn't it?
How are you doing?
I'm just a bit worried about you since we won't be back for a while.
Make sure you're eating enough, okay?
Oh! Good morning, {NAME2}-chan!
Are you feeling all right?
Well if you start to feel sick at all, make sure you go to the doctor, okay?
I know how you men are about going\nto the doctor. My hubby just hates it.
Speaking of doctors, do you know about the clinic in Yongen?
This is just a rumor, but I hear that if the doctor there likes you, she'll give you prescriptions for strong medicine.
Battling Shadows is an inevitable part of our\nongoing efforts. Having effective medicine on\nhand would provide peace of mind.
But considering the challenges we're bound\nto face in the Metaverse, I'd rather prepare\na way to access medicine and treatment.
Word on the street says Menaces are lurking\naround every corner. At least with strong\nmedicine you can relax a little, right?
Wait... Would medicine actually help with that?
Silly me! I actually don't really get this whole Menace thing!
Anyway, so about this clinic...
Oh, I'm sorry! Look at me just gabbing away. You'll be late for school!
Have a nice day, sweety!
She certainly seems to enjoy your company. Now then, shall we head to school?
No way! "Temporarily closed"?
But I wanted to come here with my hubby for beer and gyoza tonight...
Hey, you see the news yesterday? They said the Subway Slammer was an ex-baseball star!
Yes I saw it! The Subway Slammer's that Menace everyone's talking about on the Divine Justice website.
That Kiuchi guy, or whatever his name was... I've actually been shoved by him before.
Really!? That must've been hard... But now that they caught him you can rest easy!
Oh by the way, did you hear about that "calling card" thing scattered around in Shibuya?
Uhh, the Phantom Thieves or something, right? Saying they planned to steal Kiuchi's desires...
But they said on the news it was just trash from some bird. It doesn't have anything to do with the case.
The next station is Shimo-Kitazawa. The exit will be on...
Morning, you two!
I'm really glad you said yes to continuing the Phantom Thieves yesterday.
No, really, thank you. You really saved me and Tomoko.
Oh, come on. I'd be totally freaked if I had to go it alone. It's good knowing you've got my back.
Hahaha. I see you're in a good mood today. Something good happen?
Both of you agreeing to continue is a big relief for me as well. Two business partners are certainly better than one.
"Business partners" sounds pretty stuffy. Don't you think "teammates" has a better ring to it?
Hm? Uh, well, I suppose...
And it's not like we're just colleagues. After all, you're living with {NAME2}, Lufel.
If I told my parents I wanted a pet owl, they'd never allow it.
Certainly my austere appearance is too beguiling for the everyday household to handle.
Hey, Lufel. I've been meaning to say this for a while, but...
Could you stop using such fancy words? I know\nyou wanna sound refined, but I have no idea\nwhat you're talking about half the time.
I-I am doing no such thing!
As my memories started returning, I realized\nI possess knowledge of humanity dating back\nages prior to the current era...
Hahaha. Okay, okay. Since we're a team from\nhere on out, let's be the kind of teammates\nthat can tell each other anything.
Glad to be part of the team, fellow Phantom Thieves. Let's give it our all!
Oops, almost forgot I'm on classroom duty today!
And I have to get changed for gym first\nperiod! I gotta go, catch you later!
Good grief. Seems our team of Phantom Thieves certainly won't be lacking in energy.
Was he just talking to someone...?
Excellent work today. Your review was as cutting as ever!
It went according to plan is all.
You even had their part-timers running scared before you even finished.
You're incredible, Miyazawa-san. But I'd expect nothing less from a condemned Menace!
Oh stop! That makes me sound like a criminal.
Publishing my name and picture like that's no laughing matter.
I am a critic, above all else. A gourmet food connoisseur. I just don't hold back with my reviews is all.
Hahah. But Menaces are at the center of public attention right now, so it certainly isn't hurting your influence.
Hehe. Well as they say, you gotta milk it for all it's worth.
That Heritage Kitchen shop I tore to shreds today in Zoshigaya is the parent store to Victory Kitchen...
So even if my critiques are all lies, the public will slurp it up and run the place right out of business.
That oughta force ol' Pops to hand the rights to Victory Kitchen over to me.
Once Victory Kitchen's yours, we can finally go ahead and establish a chain!
Is this really okay? Changing the soup completely and passing it off like it's the real thing?
Listen...
Who on earth could possibly prove it's not?
Uhh, well, ahaha...
Here's the deal: no one actually gives a damn\nabout authenticity. People will glom onto\nwhatever's popular so they can fit in.
Calling it the "true" soup is all part of the branding. Got it?
If that's too hard for you to understand, you\nshould resign. There's a horde of people\ntripping over themselves for your spot.
I-I'm sorry! Please excuse me, sir.
Helloooo! This is Miyazawa. Thank you for calling!
Oh yes, I did see the news. Oh, I was so surprised.
My my, and just when you were about to condemn him too. What a shame.
I know! A perfectly good Menace slipped right through our fingers. Of course, we'll need to find a replacement.
Yes, of course, I'll be looking for someone to fill his place as well. Okay, bye bye.
A replacement...
Now where am I going to find someone who can rival the likes of the Subway Slammer...?
Hey! Motoha's on our team!
Huh? Obviously she's on ours!
I'm fine with whatever...
All right, find a partner and start stretching!
Ha-yah!
That was amazing, Motoha!
Motoha, you're incredible!
That spike was amazing!
I know, right? I can't believe it!
Hey.
Sit down.
We're supposed to be stretching. You need a partner, don't you?
I need to ask you somethin'.
Um, the girl you were with the other day... Arai? What's the deal with you two?
Wha\u2014!? That's not it!
She... Arai, she could tell. She knew the taste of Victory Kitchen's soup was different.
I used to work at that shop part-time.
All anyone ever says is it tastes good. But\nArai came right out and said the truth.\nWhat a badass.
I'm not really good at speakin' my mind, but she's like the total opposite.
Ah! Sorry about that.
Maybe I really am no good to be around.
Hey, Divine Justice was just updated. Apparently Hiromu Miyazawa tore apart another restaurant with his review.
Seriously? Man, god bless the Menace. Always givin' us somethin' to talk about.
He ripped apart a mom-and-pop shop saying, "The food was foul, and the service was heinous." Brutal!
But you can't seriously think that's enough to call the guy a Menace, do you?
Huh? But the guy's taken down entire restaurants with these reviews. That's a bad dude.
He's willing to show his face even if he gets dragged all over the internet for it. Just goes to show how serious he is.
I think an old shop getting lazy and letting\ntheir food and service go to hell is more of\na Menace than him.
Yeah... I guess you have a point. I know! I'll put the shop up for Divine Justice too.
Hey! You sure took your time.
That's a pretty goofy walk you got going on there...
Oh yeah, I saw you guys were paired up at gym class.
He asked you to be partners, right? Kinda unexpected based on the vibe he gave off yesterday.
What'd you guys talk about?
Sense of taste...? Ohhh, you mean about the broth at Victory Kitchen!
That's what you guys talked about? I guess\nKano-kun loves him some ramen.
Wait, he had a part-time job there!? That's intense.
Whoa, really!? Oh yeah, we did see him talk to the chef about something.
But to work there even part-time... Kano-kun\nmust be really into ramen.
Anyway, now that {NAME2}'s back, shall we get him up to speed?
Oh yeah, we were just talking about our next job.
So Lufel found Kiuchi's Palace on his own,\nright? But we still don't know where the\nother Palaces are yet...
So I was thinking, why don't we all work together to find the next one?
I, for one, am definitely in favor of Motoha's plan. It would be much safer searching in a group than alone.
Okay, that's a plan! Let me know when you\nwant to go looking!
But, before we look for Palaces, there's somewhere I want to stop by first.
I'd like to share the intel we received today with Motoha. About the clinic in Yongen-Jaya.
A clinic in Yongen?
Yes, the Takemi Medical Clinic, was it? It seems we can get our hands on strong prescriptions there.
Whoaaa, for real?
But... Do you really think they'd prescribe medicine to us despite not being injured or anything?
Time for our next class. Uh... Are you gonna get changed or...?
Ahhh... Another long day over!
You guys are headed to the clinic in Yongen, right?
That's the plan. What about you, Motoha?
I'm gonna visit Tomoko in the hospital. I wanna tell her what happened with Kiuchi.
It's from Tomoko!
Uhhh... Ah! Tomoko's getting discharged from the hospital!
That's wonderful news. You should go meet her.
Huh? But, is that okay? What about the clinic?
Following your desire is most important.
I said so before, didn't I? I don't intend\nfor this job to limit your freedom.
Thanks, you two.
Oh god, I'm crying. It's just... finally hearing from Tomoko after she was so down...
Okay!
Oh, before I forget. You said the Takemi Medical Clinic, right? I just looked it up, so I'll send you the address.
I see. I think I have an idea of its whereabouts. Thank you, Motoha.
I'll get going then! Good luck with the clinic!
Now then, shall we head to Yongen-Jaya?
Do you remember the secondhand shop we got the workbench from?
The clinic should be just left of there.
Takemi Medical Clinic... Here it is.
Just to make sure we're on the same page, our goal here is to obtain medicine.
So it'd be best for you to pose as a patient so we can get some. Don't mess it up, all right?
All right then. Let's go.
First-time visitor, yeah? What brings you in?
What are you here for today?
Please head to the exam room.
It must be stress.
I'll give you something to help you get some rest. Sleep is the best medicine.
Hmm, so you have something specific in mind. And judging by your face, you want a lot of it.
You're not sick, are you? You're here because you heard the rumors, right?
You're a weird kid, huh?
Fine by me then. You came all this way just for medicine after all.
I'll write you a prescription. But only for medication that will recover your health.
Just so you're aware, all the medicine I dispense is original.
I have a license to make my own formulas. But\nyou're responsible for your own health if you\ntake them. Long as you're fine with that.
It's your responsibility to take care of\nyourself. So if that's okay with you,\nstop by anytime.
Oh, by the way. If you cause any problems for me, the deal's off.
This is all I've got right now...
Take care.
All right. We've secured ourselves a medicine supplier.
How's it going?
Oh! Guess it went well then.
I'm good to go whenever, so hit me up when you wanna search Mementos!
Can we talk for a moment?
Do you remember the fortune teller we met last night?
Yes. Her prediction that "trying to sate our hunger would lead to disaster..."
...actually turned out to be true.
Now I find myself in want of such power. Learning to use it could be very beneficial to us.
The Airsoft Shop in Shibuya, the clinic in Yongen-Jaya, and the Fortune Teller in Shinjuku.
Let's remember these places when preparing to enter the Metaverse.
All right. Our goal is to find the next Palace, right?
With Kiuchi's Palace, you were able to sense it somehow, weren't you, Cattle?
Precisely. Tuning into the sound of the collective unconscious allowed me to sniff it out.
Okay, and this collective unconscious sound... Can you still make it out from here?
Unsurprisingly, it's rather challenging to hear the area ahead from this spot.
Mementos contains multiple distinct areas.
There is an entirely separate area ahead of us.
So would that mean each area has its own Palace with its own Treasure?
Precisely. You're pretty quick on the uptake, Closer.
But how're we gonna get to the next area?
I believe it'll be easier to show you.
Get in. We're heading into the depths of this area.
A dead end?
Wait, it sorta looks like a door.
Observe.
It opened!
A new area has been confirmed. Updating guidance information.
What was that voice?
The Metaverse Navigator.
Whoa, I've never seen this screen before. Check yours, Wonder.
It's the same.
As I've mentioned, Mementos is the collective unconscious of humanity.
Those with fervent desires are considered\ndisruptive here, causing the collective\nunconscious force to try to expel them.
I used that force to our advantage and opened the door.
Intense desire?
We are in possession of Kiuchi's Treasure, are we not?
Oh! So because we have the Treasure, we're mistaken for holding intense desire...
And then Mementos tries to force us out... Hang on.
So the door didn't open to let us through...
...but to mean, "What are you doing? Get outta here!"?
We're phantom thieves. It'd be strange if they welcomed us in with open arms.
I guess you have a point there.
So from here on out, we find the Palace in each area, steal the Treasure, then move on to the next one.
We continue like that until we've reached the furthest depths of Mementos.
Yup! We'll be with you every step of the way.
Hoohoo, dependable as ever. Since we're here, shall we proceed to the next area?
So this is the new area? It feels pretty different to the last one.
Hmmm.
The next Palace must be in this area... but I can't narrow in on its location.
So you can't find it?
With Kiuchi, there was a lot of public attention on his erratic behavior.
That made it easy to gather information on his Palace quickly.
Yeah, Kiuchi had a lot of victims... and everyone knew the Subway Slammer.
So the next Palace ruler must be someone doing bad things in secret.
Most bad people start out that way, so it's certainly a plausible assumption.
There is no need for immediate haste. If we can't find any information here, we'll just have to return to the real world.
Opening up this new area of Mementos likely had some impact there as well.
Oh yeah. The Metaverse and the real world are supposed to be linked somehow, right?
Yes. That link could aid us in locating the Palace. Let's head back to the real world for now.
We could keep exploring, but we're likely to come upon stronger enemies than we've ever battled before. Stay vigilant.
*yawn* I'm beat! Coming back from the Metaverse always makes me hungry.
Oh! How about we give our victory party a do-over? We could go back to Victory Kitchen!
Well I'm sure if I order the salt or miso-flavored ramen it'll probably be fine.
Better not. They're all the same.
Huh? Oh, Kano-kun!
Ah, sorry. Ignore me. I just heard you guys talkin' and\u2014
Oh, wait! You used to work at Victory Kitchen, right?
I've been thinking... there's something off about the new flavor of the soup.
Am I just losing my mind here? Everyone else seems to think it's perfectly fine...
No... You're right, Arai.
Victory Kitchen's true flavor was ruined... What they're serving now is a betrayal to their customers.
Wait, really?
But don't get me wrong. It's not the staff's fault.
Nothing...
I think that's a good idea.
Okay. I'm sure you know what you're talking about since you worked there.
I just wanted to taste the ramen from my little league days.
It's kind of sad knowing it's gone...
Hoom? Was that...?
Arai. How would you like to have a real bowl of Victory Ramen?
Huh? Well, yeah.
Okay. In that case...
Tonight I'll show you a shop where you can get some authentic Victory Ramen. If you want.
Whoa, really!?
Yeah. I'm sure it won't disappoint.
How about you, {NAME1}? You've got "hungry" written all over your face.
Hah. You're a pretty funny guy.
I said tonight, didn't I? I'm sure you'll be hungry by then.
I'm not up to anything. I just invited you to eat some ramen, geez.
Meet me at Heritage Kitchen tonight. You can find the address online.
See ya later then.
Yay! I get to taste Victory Ramen again. I can't wait!
That Kano guy... could he be...
Hm? What is it, Lufel?
Um, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
You two enjoy the ramen without me. My presence would likely trouble the staff.
But, {NAME2}! Don't you forget to put some roasted pork in your bag for me.
Okay, let's head home for now and meet back up at Heritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya tonight!
Hey, {NAME2}. Ready for some ramen at Heritage Kitchen in Zoshigaya!?
I'm headed there now! See you in a bit!
All right, we should get going as well.
Hey, {NAME2}, over here!
Seems like Kano-kun's not here yet.
The sign says "Temporarily closed. Reopening TBD." Do you think we're in the right place?
I tried looking it up just to be sure, but there's no other shops with the same name.
Also, it seems like this place has weirdly awful reviews.
Hang on... "Heritage Kitchen." I feel like I've heard that name before.
Ah, you're here.
Kano-kun! You were inside?
I know the owner. Come on in.
That was sooo good! I enjoyed that with my whole heart and soul.
Great. Glad you liked it.
My pleasure.
Seeing the joy on your faces from eating my soup made the effort worth it.
Hang on, you made this!? Not someone from the restaurant!?
Yeah. I mean, I'm still in training though.
Even still, that's amazing! Your soup tastes\nexactly like the Victory Kitchen from back\nthen. This is the flavor I was craving.
But wait, this is Heritage Kitchen, isn't it? Why does the soup taste like Victory Kitchen?
You really have a keen sense of taste, Arai.
Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku is a branch store of Heritage Kitchen.
Ohhh, so this store's the original!
That's right. This is a Chinese restaurant, but its renowned ramen brought in lots of young chefs looking to train.
So the owner, Pops, decided to open Victory Kitchen as a sort of training ground for aspiring chefs.
Wow! The owner must be really passionate about cooking.
Yeah. I was blown away when I first tried the ramen here...
Now don't go on flatterin' me, Shun.
Yamagoshi-san!?
Welcome, you two. Make yourselves at home.
Are you all right? You really should be resting.
I feel fine now. It's not every day I see you bring friends here. Least lemme say hello.
So, where do you two live? Do you do the uh, emailin'? No wait, textin'?
Uh, what?
Wha\u2014!? Pops! What're ya talkin' about?
Haha, relax, Shun. Young people these days are always exchangin' beeper numbers and all that, right?
No one uses those anymore, Pops...
Sorry, you two. Shun's a great kid, but he's a bit shy when it comes to socializin'.
If ya ever need a hand, just gimme a beep.
P-Please stop...
Hahaha, you're so funny! Might as well exchange info.
So then, what'd ya think of the flavor? Suit your taste all right?
It was delicious! I've been really missing this taste!
The taste of the bonito flakes just hits you like "bam!" It kinda brings out the flavor of all the other ingredients! Right?
Haha, I told ya so, Shun! Great work!
No, I... But...
I know what you're gonna say.
From the smell, I'm guessin' you still can't get the shavings quite right, is that it?
You really are the master. Yeah, I can't get the shavings to come out the way I want...
All right, I'll take a look at your technique. After you see your friends off, we can practice in the kitc\u2014
*cough* *wheeze*
You're not well! You need rest or you'll...
How can I sleep after that damn Miyazawa came by...
Miyazawa was here!?
He scared the entire staff into quittin'. Now\nI can't run the shop tomorrow. I don't know\nwhat's gonna happen to this place...
All I ever wanted was to give customers authentic flavor...
Pops...
I gotta clean up and help Pops get home. Thanks for today.
No problem! Thank you for the food! It was amazing!
Sure thing. See ya.
Do you think Yamagoshi-san's okay? I'm worried...
And "that damn Miyazawa"? What do you think that's about?
It's being stolen.
Oh hey, Lufel. You've been so quiet and well-behaved. Good boy!
Wait, hang on, "It's being stolen"? What's being stolen?
Hope. I can sense traces of exploited desire around here.
If it's coming from here, then that means...
The next Palace is connected with this shop somehow?
Oh? You two are...?
Um... Oh, you're the chef from Victory Kitchen, right?
Ahhh, you came to the shop the other day! I'm so sorry about what happened.
U-Uh, no problem! We got our refund, so there's no need to apologize any more...
Don't be silly. We owe our shop to customers like you.
But ever since Miyazawa got involved...!
Hoom? This guy seems to know a lot about whatever's going on between the shop and Miyazawa.
And it appears his hope is being stolen as well. We should listen to what he has to say.
By the way, based on those uniforms I'm guessing you two go to Kokatsu, right?
We have a part-timer at Victory Kitchen who goes there too. Well, I guess he doesn't technically work there anymore...
Oh, we're actually Kano-kun's friends!\nWould you mind telling us what happened\nwith him?
Kano... You mean you're Shun's friends?
Heritage Kitchen is my master's shop.
I was worried after Miyazawa lambasted the place on TV this afternoon, so I came by to check on him.
Miyazawa... You mean the man who came to your shop the other day? Celebrity food critic Hiromu Miyazawa?
Yes... Once that guy sets his sights on a\nshop, he churns out review after review,\npanning the place down.
Regardless of whether his critiques are valid\nor fabricated, his viewers lap up every word.\nEventually, customers stop coming.
Seriously!?
It'd be one thing if the shops Miyazawa blasted were actually bad, but...
The real reason he gives such bad reviews is so he can steal the rights to a shop after putting them out of business.
He ruins a shop's reputation, messes with the flavor of their dishes, and then reopens.
That's why Victory Kitchen tastes different than before!
That's right. It's exactly how it seems. Our new broth is made with shoddy ingredients.
Yeah! I bet if word got out about what he's doing, the public would eat him alive!
Even if I did expose him, no one would believe it. Besides, Miyazawa's a condemned Menace now...
He has contacts all over the food and showbiz\nindustries doing backdoor deals to prevent\nany evidence or testimony getting out.
Against Miyazawa's overwhelming influence, the shop would be forced to shut down.
But there must be something we can do about it!
We could beg Miyazawa to retract the review, but that would mean...
No, I shouldn't be bothering you two with this stuff. Sorry, don't worry about it.
But... Why did Miyazawa set his sights on Victory Kitchen in the first place?
No idea... I don't know what would make him go after us.
But I do know that Shun is blaming himself for it.
The first time Miyazawa came to review our shop, Shun was working there...
The second Miyazawa started making fun of our signature broth, Shun got angry and splashed water in his face.
I don't know if that was the reason, but after that Miyazawa gave us terrible reviews, and the shop's been suffering ever since.
But please don't misunderstand. I don't think Shun did anything wrong.
Miyazawa insulted our pride as professional chefs. We should have been the ones to stand up to him.
Poor Shun saw us unable to act, and stood up to him in our place.
I think Kano-kun is still inside. You should\ngo talk to him.
No... I should go.
Shun's been hard on himself ever since what happened. He thinks he caused trouble for everyone at the shop.
If I talk to him now, he might end up feeling more guilty, and I don't want to put him through that.
Masa-san...
Anyway, sorry to bug you with all this. I hope you two will keep being good friends with Shun.
Just as I thought. People who have some form of connection to this shop are having their hope stolen.
Yamagoshi-san, Masa-san, and Kano-kun, too...
That's right. And it's likely someone related to the shop is the next Palace's ruler.
Let's come back tomorrow and investigate the area around the shop. I'd like to confirm my suspicions.
Good morning, {NAME1}-kun.
Thanks for talking to me like normal. I've been anxious about coming back to school...
Yeah, I'm able to go to school again starting today.
I'm worried everyone at school's probably been talking about me.
Getting attacked by the notorious Subway Slammer, Kiuchi... Falling onto the subway tracks and ending up in the hospital...
Right... Thanks.
After the incident, everything fell apart.\nThe dream Motoha and I shared was shattered,\nI put the baseball team through a lot...
Baseball's the only thing I was good for, and now that's gone too.
I didn't really know what to do with myself... For a while I really lost the will to go on...
But Motoha... She was there for me through all of it. Comforting me, encouraging me...
She told me about you too. She said you came to see me at the hospital. Thanks for that.
Then when she broke the news about Kiuchi getting caught, all of a sudden I thought...
"I want to live." It was like this energy surging up in my heart.
Maybe hearing the news about Kiuchi was exactly what I needed. Guess I'm easy to please, haha.
I'm sure the change of heart was a factor, but this is likely due to us unsealing a new area of Mementos.
The people who couldn't reckon with their desires are slowly starting to grab hold of hope once again.
You think so? Hehe, that's nice of you to say. Truth is, I was kind of scared to come to the station today.
But seeing you here helps. I'm glad I get to go to school again.
It really is. And I'm glad that Motoha seems a lot happier recently too.
I wonder if something's been making her happy these days... Or maybe someone...?
Oh, sorry! Didn't mean to talk your ear off. The train's coming, so let's talk later, okay?
Today was sooo long. The scholar's life is definitely not for me!
So what's the plan today? Should we hit Mementos?
The next Palace ruler likely has some connection to Heritage Kitchen. Let's give the place another visit.
They're closed again today. I hope Yamagoshi-san's doing okay.
It smells...
Huh? No way, do I really!?
I-I did get kind of sweaty from gym today... Ahahah...
Not your smell. I can sense waning desire from within the shop.
Inside? So then...!
Let's check it out. But the same cautions from confronting Kiuchi apply here, so stay on your guard.
I told you, it's simple. All you have to do is stamp your name on this little piece of paper. What's the hold up?
No. I can't do it. I won't turn this shop, or Victory Kitchen, over to you.
You just keep harping on the same old tune, don't you? Enough dancing, Yamagoshi-san. Time to sing a new song.
I'm sorry, we're closed today... Oh, it's you two...
Whaddya want? We're in the middle of serious business right now.
Hiromu Miyazawa!? Why are you here?
Manager, escort these kids to the door.
How dare you! These are my valued customers. You're the ones who should leave.
Excuse me? Is that really how you want to play this? Your shop's on the brink of collapse, y'know.
Yamagoshi-san, your health isn't what it used to be. I'm already in talks with Masa-kun from Victory Kitchen...
All you have to do is sign the contract passing ownership over to me.
In my hands, your beloved little shop will become a booming sensation with chains across the country!
Enough! You wanna feed my customers with your lies!?
I won't have it! I\u2014 Ugn...!
Whoa, easy there. Someone in your condition shouldn't be getting themselves so worked up.
You owned this shop with your late wife, didn't you? Do you really want to watch it all crumble?
You'd let your only memory of her slip through your fingers over something as trifling as "authentic flavor"?
You don't know the first thing about\u2014
Nngh...
Yamagoshi-san!
Oh dear, he really has overdone it. You there, girl, call an ambulance, would ya?
Like I need you to tell me!
Okay, contract signed.
You need your eyes checked, kid. You didn't see Yamagoshi-san stamp the contract just now?
Pops!
Miyazawa!
You bastard! What did you do to him!?
Uch... I didn't do... anything. Ach... Let go! What, are you gonna hit me...?
Shun... Stop...
Manager, you got that, right!?
"Violent Punk Attacks Celebrity Critic"... If I post this video, you are finished. Your future? Gone.
So I'd recommend keeping quiet, Yamagoshi-san. For your sake and his.
You monster!
Shun... He's trying to bait you... Don't give him what he wants...
I-I'm sorry, Pops... I lost it again...
Just like last time... I'm making things even worse...!
You haven't done anything wrong, Shun. In fact, I like that side of you.
Blunt, straightforward, a little rough around the edges... with a dead-set determination for cooking.
Never forget, Shun. A smiling customer is what brings us chefs pride.
Please, never turn your back on tha\u2014 *hack*
Oh brother, enough with the tears and the melodrama. You're making me out like the bad guy.
Oh dear, are all youths these days so insolent? And they say I'm a Menace?
Ah...! Here's an idea.
You. Shun-kun, was it? How would you like me to give you a fighting chance?
Let's decide this with a Food Fight!
Food fight...?
Yes, Food Fight! It's a video series on my channel. You haven't heard of it?
The contestant cooks a dish, and if it wows my tastebuds I declare them the winner!
If by some chance you manage to win, I'll stop going after your precious little shops.
Buuut, if you're really that insecure, you don't have to compete. I'm more than happy taking the shop here and now.
So what's it gonna be?
Hey, hey, don't fold so easily. I've lost matches before.
That means even you have a chance of winning. So, Shun-kun. How about it? Are you in?
I'll do it.
You want a fight? You got one!
That's the spirit! All right then, I'll announce the date on my channel.
So keep an eye out for the details. Try not to go running scared before then, kid.
Kano-kun! The ambulance is here!
Sounds like our cue to split. See you again, Shun-kun.
Miyazawa. You already stamped the contract. Why bother challenging the kid to a Food Fight?
Cause that brat's gotten on my last nerve. Screaming "real" this, "authentic" that...
This way we can break him down and shut him up for good.
And if we get him roasted online in the process, I can finally get my hands on the replacement I've been looking for.
Replacement for what?
You don't need to know. Now then, I have an announcement video to make!
One of the neighbors went with him in the ambulance.
Okay. It seems like his breathing is mostly back to normal. I'm sure he'll be okay...
And um, Kano-kun? {NAME2} sort of\nmentioned... You're taking part in a\nFood Fight?
I've actually seen the show before. Miyazawa\ncompetes with chefs who've disputed\nhis reviews.
In the end they lose, get savage reviews,\nand it's made to look like Miyazawa was\nright all along.
And it's not like it's live TV. It's his own\nchannel, so he can have the footage edited\nhowever he wants. It's got to be a trap!
Yeah... You're probably right. But I don't\nhave any other option.
Apparently Miyazawa's lost before. So if it\nmeans even the slightest chance of winning\nthe shop back, I have to take the risk.
Miyazawa losing at his own game? I don't\nknow, there's definitely something fishy\nabout that...
You're right...
How about we just go public with this? Let\neveryone know that Miyazawa sabotaged Victory\nKitchen's flavor with cheap ingredients.
You know how much influence he has. The second we say somethin', he'll just spin some more lies and fool everyone.
No one will believe the truth unless they hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
Okay, let's say you manage to win the Food Fight. How do we know Miyazawa won't just...
Yeah, I doubt he'll follow through on his promise to leave the shop alone...
But even if I lose, I'd just be some stupid\nkid who made a fool of himself. I won't cause\nany trouble for Pops or the staff.
Long as I'm the only one that stands to get hurt, I don't mind fighting a losing battle.
Kano-kun...
Don't worry about me. If you guys get involved any further, Miyazawa might come after you too.
I'll figure somethin' out on my own. Please... Don't get tangled up in my mess anymore.
There's no doubt about it. The next Palace's ruler has to be Hiromu Miyazawa.
He's the only one using the situation at Heritage Kitchen to fulfill his own selfish desires.
The people caught in his crosshairs and even\nthe customers, are all having their\ndesires stolen.
You're right. Everyone's getting dragged\nalong by Miyazawa's opinion, so despite the\nobvious drop in quality...
...they think nothing of it. And all the\nstaff can do is throw in the towel and suffer\nin silence.
Indeed. And you remember what happens to a person once all of their hope's been stolen from them, right, {NAME2}?
Yeah. We have to take back their desires and make Miyazawa confess to his crimes.
All right then, let's head to Mementos. I'm sure we'll be able to find Miyazawa's Palace now.
Remember, we're entering a new area, which\nmeans stronger enemies. Let's ensure we have\neverything we need before proceeding.
We going in? Okay...
You wanna hit Zoshigaya tonight? I'm craving some Heritage Kitchen gyoza.
Huh? That place has been getting awful reviews lately. Look, one-stars across the board.
"Trying to ride the success of days long passed, Heritage Kitchen's given up on improving itself all together."
Aw, damn! That place used to be so good. A great bang for your buck too!
There goes another of my few remaining joys in life...
Well, nothin' to do but give up and get over it.
It's true... All the people who saw Miyazawa's show are leaving horrible reviews about Heritage Kitchen.
Even people who've never been to the shop before are posting complaints about it.
Another side effect of living in a world of fading hope.
Losing desire can lead one to lose their own\nagency, leaving them suggestible and easily\nherded along by public opinion.
So before things get that far...
We have to find Miyazawa's Palace and take it down.
Hellooo, glad you picked up. Yes, uh-huh, of course. I'll get right to the point...
I found the peeerfect replacement for Kiuchi.
He's a hot-headed youth... Yes, and I've set him up so he'll have no choice but to appear on my program...
And, um... If everything goes to plan this time... Well, about the entertainment production committee...
Yes, of course. Only if the plan goes well, right... I would be so thankful for your consideration...!
Yes, of course... Thank you for your time! All right, thank you, bye bye now.
*chuckle* Finally... Finally my dream is becoming a reality...
Sorry, Shun-kun. Can't make a best picture without a few cuts.
Hiromu... Miyazawa...
All right.
It seems the Palace ruler is definitely Miyazawa.
From the voices of humanity responding to his name, I can sense the Palace just ahead.
Nice! So, you know where it is?
Yes. It shouldn't be far from here. Let's go.
We're here. Right beyond this point is... Hiromu Miyazawa's Palace.
The entrance looks just like the one to Kiuchi's Palace.
Palace rulers revel in their own twisted desires, so they're considered deviant by the public.
Even within Mementos, Palaces take the form of solitary fortresses, separated from the rest of society.
So Kiuchi and Miyazawa were shunned by the collective unconscious the same way we were kicked into this new area?
The wandering Shadows inside are likely under Miyazawa's control, so don't let your guards down.
Looks like we can't get past here!
Let's see if we can find an infiltration\nroute nearby. Perhaps we can get in\nwithout alerting any enemies...
All right! Let's get moving then!
A Japanese castle...? And a super flashy-looking one at that...
This is supposedly Miyazawa's perception of reality...
But why a castle? Do you think the inside's actually a huge ramen shop or something?
Haha, glad someone's got a sense of humor.
Delicious...?
Well I'm sure we'll uncover a great deal of the Palace's mysteries as we search for the Treasure.
The plan up until the change of heart is the same as it was for Kiuchi.
Right. First locate a route to the Treasure, then send out the calling card... right?
That's right. Now, stay sharp you two. Let's get moving!
This area is completely different from what we've seen here so far.
That sign says, "Open Set."
Hey, look at that.
Those are cameras and film equipment... right?
Oh yeah, it's a film studio! This isn't a real castle, it's a set made to look like a castle.
But why a film studio? Does it have something to do with Miyazawa's desires?
We're still some distance away from the Treasure.
Looks like we can head further through there.
Not budging, huh?
What is that? There's some sort of movie poster hung on the wall here...
Come look at this!
That's... Kano-kun, isn't it? He's even\nwearing our school uniform.
There's something written up there, yes?\nLet me see.
"Coming Soon... Brat vs. Blade: The\nFinal Cut."
"Brat vs. Blade: The Final Cut"? By the look\nof things, Miyazawa's probably got something\nnasty planned for Kano-kun...
So that means...!
You're right! It has to be.
He has no intention to give Kano-kun a\nchance to win in the slightest!
Yeah. I think this must be about the\nFood Fight!
So Miyazawa planned to destroy Kano-kun in\nthe fight from the get-go!
Right. And the "Coming Soon" bit must be\nreferring to the day of the Food Fight.
In other words, we can't get into this area\nuntil the fight happens.
But by then it'll already be too late!\nKano-kun's going to get hurt before we can\ncause the change of heart!
I know...
For now all we can do is return to the real\nworld and try to get ahold of Shun Kano.
Yeah. We have to stop him from doing that\nFood Fight and falling into Miyazawa's trap.
And if Kano-kun refuses to fight, this\nbarrier will probably change too.
Let's talk to Kano-kun at school tomorrow,\nWonder.
Between the film studio and movie poster,\nI wonder what kind of desire twisted\nMiyazawa's heart like this.
By the way, Closer, do you think you\nwouldn't mind putting me down anytime soon?
Oh! Sorry!
We've made good progress strategizing.\nLet's pause here for now.
Leader, it's up to you whether we head back\nor keep exploring.
It's late. We should get\nsome rest.
Let me ask you something, {NAME2}.
About opening the door to that new area\nin Mementos...
It means that more people will become\nawakened to their desires now.
Kiuchi and other humans who've become Palace\nrulers, are compelled by intense desires to\nwalk the path to their own destruction.
Conversely, we, compelled by our intense\ndesires, force them to have a change\nof heart.
Despite that obvious hypocrisy, do you still\nthink we're doing the right thing?
I see... I wonder if that conviction is\nanother symptom of your strong desire.
I see... Knowing you can approach things\nobjectively like that does make me\nfeel better.
Prejudgments and one-sided beliefs will only\nend up warping into evil desires.
Oh... I never would've thought of it like\nthat. So the results determine whether an\naction was right or wrong, huh?
Sorry for the sudden question. Think of it\nas a routine work check-in.
Anyhoo, it's interesting to hear the way\nyou think.
Humans truly are compelling creatures.\nI look forward to learning more while I'm\nby your side.
Now there's the issue of our enemies in the\nMetaverse growing stronger. If only we could\nattain a power boost like that...
I just wanted to taste the ramen from my\nlittle league days.
That time, I thought I could sense potential\nfor hope coming from...
Actually, never mind. It's about time for bed.
Allow me to extend my congratulations to\nyou on my master's behalf.
In addition to punishing the sinner of lust,\nyou have successfully identified the\nnext offender.
For this, your unyielding desire must be\ncommended.
And I bring favorable news.
Your actions have opened new paths of escape\nfrom inevitable ruin.
Offering an explanation would be simple\nenough...
But I would hate to sully your ability to\nchoose for yourself.
You ought to see it with your own eyes.
It would also appear that the number of\npeople relying on your decisions...
...is due to increase.
I believe it is suffice to say, your choices\nhave already begun influencing the hopes and\ndesires of others...
You would do best to keep that in mind.
Lunchtime! I'm starving!
What!? There's no chopsticks in my lunch\nbag! That's just cruel! Is Mom a Menace\nnow too?
I just checked with Tomoko. She said\nKano-kun's here today.
What should we do? I think it should be\neasy to find him during lunch.
Agreed.
Let's do it.
We have no idea when the Food Fight is\nsupposed to be. Don't you think contacting\nKano right away is paramount?
That's right. Let's go talk to him now.
Huh? I just got this text from Tomoko. She\nsaid Kano-kun's not in the classroom.
Maybe he's eating lunch somewhere else.\nAny idea where he might be?
Oh, really? Okay, let's go check there.
You've seen him eating ramen on the rooftop\nbefore? We should go check there then.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch break. Could I\nspeak with you for a moment?
Ms. Katayama? Uh, but we were just\nabout to...
Either one of you is fine.
In that case... I will. Do you mind,\n{NAME2}?
Ah, much appreciated. It shouldn't take\ntoo long.
Good luck with Kano-kun.
All right then, let's go look for Kano.
What are you doin' here? You eat lunch\nup here too?
Used to be no one came up here but me...\nWell, it's all yours.
What? You gonna tell me not to do the\nFood Fight?
We already talked about this. I know\nMiyazawa has some trick up his sleeve.
You don't have to tell me, I already know.
Yeah... Nothing good comes from hangin'\naround me.
So why are you here? Is it about the\nFood Fight? 'Cause we already talked about\nthis. I know it's a setup.
Miyazawa obviously didn't suggest it out of\nthe goodness of his heart.
He's gonna use the Food Fight to beat me\ndown so I can't speak out against him\nanymore.
But if I run away from this... it means I'd\nbe responsible for ruining Pops's ramen.
That's the one mistake I can't bear to\nlive with.
When I was in elementary school, my parents\ngot divorced. My mother, she raised me all\nby herself.
But my mom's an ER nurse, so there were days\nwhen she wouldn't get home till long past\ndinner time.
One night, I was so hungry, I went into town\nto try and find somethin' to eat.
I happened to pass in front of Victory\nKitchen, and the smell of the food comin'\nfrom inside lured me in.
I just stopped and stared at the shop, with\nmy stomach rumbling... Then Pops, Yamagoshi-san,\ngave me a bowl on the house.
Hey there, sport. What's up? Ya hungry?
Your mom's working in the ER? Your dad is...\nnot around, huh? I see...
What do ya think, hit the spot?
Yeah!
Aha, we finally get to see a smile on\nthat face!
You know, this is the ramen my late wife loved the most.
Somehow the customers too... They always\nbreak out in a huge smile whenever they\neat it.
Haha, just like you right now.
That's why I've got to protect this flavor\nfor the rest of my life. It's my purpose...\nMy pride.
Since then, I started going to Victory\nKitchen regularly. I even learned to make\nramen on the down low.
Pops would always say, "Wait until\nhigh school!"
Yeah... Pops has always been kind of like...\na father to me.
And Masa-san... He's my senior at\nVictory Kitchen.
The two of us always dreamed of opening our\nown branch, to make ramen with a flavor we\ncan call our own.
But then Miyazawa showed up... and\neverything changed.
He came in claimin' to be some famous\ngourmet so-and-so, and started spouting BS\ncriticism against our soup.
"The broth tastes like something out of my\ngrandma's kitchen," "The bonito flakes are\nsecond-rate..."
All kinds of fabricated nonsense. I know what\ngoes in our soup, so I was aware he was just\ntryin' to drag our name through the mud.
Then... I got mad and threw a cup of water\non his face.
It's not something I'm proud of. At least\nthey left it out of the TV broadcast.
Yeah, I know. I was one step from getting\nthe cops called on me. Good thing they left\nit out of the TV broadcast.
Thanks to my slipup, Victory Kitchen's become\nMiyazawa's punching bag. With all his bad\nreviews circulating...
...the shop's been facing slander from all\nover. Pops has never been in good health, but\nall of this... pushed him over the edge.
Since he's been unable to work, the shop's\nbeen struggling financially and the customers\nhave stopped comin'.
So Masa-san begged Miyazawa. He told him that no matter what, he can't let the shop go under.
Then Miyazawa started dictating our flavor.\nHe filled the soup we poured our hearts into\nwith cheap, crappy bonito flakes.
You must get it by now. This is all\nmy fault.
I appreciate you sayin' that, but firing me\nwas actually one of Miyazawa's conditions\nfor agreeing to stop the bad reviews.
It took a lot of effort by your teacher,\nMs. Katayama, to keep me from gettin' into\nworse trouble.
Ms. Katayama had to pull a bunch of strings\nto stop the water splashing incident from\nbeing publicized.
Anyway, long story short, I'm not gonna back\noutta the Food Fight.
Hey, did you see that news? About the\nex-baseball player Kiuchi gettin' arrested.
He said somethin' like, "the evil in his\nheart was lifted away," and that's why\nhe confessed.
I wish Miyazawa would just admit his\nwrongdoing to the world like Kiuchi did...
But there's no way everything could work\nitself out that easily.
Sorry, one sec.
That asshole! Are you kiddin' me!?
I have to go. Something's come up.
It's nothin'. You should eat your lunch.\nBreak's almost over.
{NAME2}, look at this! This video was\njust uploaded...
Sorry for calling you here so suddenly,\nbut I think you'd better give it a watch.
Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to\nKatana Tongue Live.
Now, sorry to surprise you all during lunch\nhour, but I am here to announce the next\nFood Fight!
The battle will commence here at Shinjuku's\nVictory Kitchen! You might remember it from\nmy Stupidly Honest Review series on TV.
This shop lost its flavor until I worked\nwith them to bring it back.
In light of that success, the shop's founder\nYamagoshi-san has turned management rights\nover to me.
With this, I intend to bring Victory\nKitchen's popularity to new and greater heights!
But in spite of all this, there is a kid out\nthere claiming Victory Kitchen's current\ntaste is not true to the original.
Apparently, he's notorious for bad-mouthing\nrestaurants all over town.
What's this really about? Engagement\nfarming? Trying to become a Menace and get his\nfifteen minutes of fame?
I think it's only proper to settle things\nwith a boy like this in front of an audience.
In the next episode of Food Fight, I'll have\nhim produce this supposed "real flavor"\nright here for all of you to see.
That is why I have borrowed the kitchen here\nat Victory Kitchen for our battle today!
So, see you here this afternoon, kid.\nI'll be waiting!
The Food Fight video will be uploaded within\nthe next few days, so I hope you're all\nlooking forward to it! And remember...
With the might of my pen, I cut through bad\ntaste cleaner than any sword!
This is Katana Tongue Miyazawa signing off.\nHave a great lunch!
Ms. Katayama pulled me aside earlier to\nshow me this.
She said the boy pictured in the video\nlooked like Kano-kun, and wanted to ask if\nI knew anything.
Apparently she saw us talking with Kano-kun\noutside Victory Kitchen.
I see. So that's why she decided to ask one\nof you.
According to this video, the Food Fight's\ngonna be this afternoon... So really any\nminute now.
Right. I'm willing to bet that's why Kano\nran off in such a hurry before.
He did!? So you talked to him? How did\nit go!?
Whoa... So Victory Kitchen really is special\nto Kano-kun.
Miyazawa took it away from him, and now he's\ntrying to tear it apart... I understand why\nhe's so angry.
But in the end... we couldn't stop him from\ngoing to the Food Fight...
It was beyond our control. He chose that\npath by his own will.
But based on what we saw at the Palace,\nMiyazawa's intent to crush Kano is real.
I've got a bad feeling about this. Obviously\nI'm worried about Kano-kun losing...
But it feels like something much worse\nthan that...
You lost fair and square, kid. Your ramen\nwas revolting!
"Fair and square"!?
You bastard! You threw out the soul of\nVictory Kitchen, and now\u2014!
Oh hellooo! Oh, it went perfectly? Yes, that\nis just fantastic! Thank yooouuu!
Congratulations, Shun Kano-kun! You're now\nofficially a condemned Menace!
Now the world knows you're a clout-chasing\npunk who doesn't know the first thing about\ngood flavor! Wahahahahaha!
M-Menace...? Me?
Shun! The hospital just called!
Pops had a heart attack... They said\nhe's dead...
My god... No...
Ahhh, all that stress finally got to him,\nhuh? Thanks to a certain brat always causing\nhim trouble...
Poor Yamagoshi-san... Caring about a problem\nchild like you literally stopped his heart.\nHeheh... Gahahaha!
Huh? What's wrong? Are you okay?
Wait... Did you just have some kind\nof vision?
This is pure speculation, but it seems\n{NAME2} has been having strange fits\nlike this ever since I met him.
We're running out of time. If you have some\npremonition that could help us find a\nsolution to this, speak up.
Your phone? Are you gonna call somebody?
Yamagoshi?
Oh! Yamagoshi-san must know some way we can\nconvince Kano-kun to back out of the fight!
Ah, hey there, sport.
Right... The Food Fight video. I saw it too.\nI'm really worried about Shun...
But now that I'm stuck in the hospital,\nI have no way to help him...
And... with everythin' that's happening...\nI just feel so exhausted.
That contract to give away the shop... I don't\neven remember signing it... But he has it now,\nso I guess there's nothin' I can do...
He sounds just like Tomoko did when she was\nin the hospital...!
I feel terrible for Masa and Shun... There's\njust nothin' else I can do about it...
He's going through with the fight!? Well,\nguess he's not one to back down after\ngettin' called out like that.
But there's no way he'll get a fair shot...\nDamn it! I wanna help him, I just...
The soul of Victory Kitchen...?
I think I know... But Miyazawa threw them\nall away...
Wait, unless... there's still that...
"That"...?
Yes. I wanted to pass it down to Shun, so I\nput it in the safe at Victory Kitchen.
It was given to me by my late wife... I kept\nit to remember her by. I planned to give it\nto Shun once he completed his training.
If you ask Masa, he can get it for ya. Could\nyou two give it to Shun for me?
Thank you. I'm glad Shun has found such\ngood friends...
I didn't catch all of that, but essentially\nthere's an item in the safe at Victory\nKitchen we can use to help Kano?
We should get over there right away!
So that's the long and short of how this is\ngonna go. Put simply...
Shun-kun makes ramen, we eat it, and\ncriticize it.
"This is not the authentic taste of Victory\nKitchen." Or, "This slop cannot be called\nVictory Ramen!"
Which line do you want, Masa-kun? Hmmm, I\nthink the more fiery reaction is better,\ndon't you?
You mean the fight is fixed!? I refuse to\ntake part in this!
Huh? You still think you're in a position\nto refuse?
You heard what I said in the video, didn't\nyou? I am the legal owner of this shop.
And I won't hesitate to fire your ass and\nreplace it with someone more compliant.
Shun's in school right now anyway! He can't\nleave in the middle of the day to come here!
So what? I'm too busy to wait. Don't you\nworry, that kid will come.
And there he is.
You dare call me a liar? You're the one\nwhose lies and bullshit ruined\nVictory Kitchen!
Wh-Wha\u2014 Shun!
What are you doing here!? Miyazawa is\nsetting you up to lose!
I know, Masa-san! I'm going to fight anyway.
I'll defend Pops's pride... and give\nMiyazawa a taste of the real Victory\nKitchen!
Hah! "Real" this, "pride" that. Geez, you and\nYamagoshi-san with your doe-eyed delusions\nabout "the soul of Victory Kitchen."
Enough. Masa-kun, you're in the way, so\nwould you mind getting out?
Can't have you going soft and complimenting\nhis food during the fight. Go on, get out.
Ngh...! I'm sorry, Shun. It seems like\nthere's no way I can help you.
It's okay. Thanks for letting me borrow\nyour kitchen, Masa-san.
It's not "borrowing."
This place is where you belong.
Knock 'em dead, Shun!
Crap, Miyazawa just posted an update...\n"Today's Food Fight challenger has arrived!"
Kano-kun must already be at Victory Kitchen\ngetting ready as we speak!
What do we do? What if we don't make it\nthere before the fight?
Is that an owl...?
Sitting in his bag like that... It looks\nlike something out of a manga...
*gasp* I can use this for material!
Notebook, notebook... Huh? Where is it?\nJust when I need it most!
We've stopped?
Huh, what happened? Why did we stop?
Could there be an accident or something?
This is an announcement. A person has been\nseen on the tracks. We are making an\nemergency stop.
We will resume travel after ensuring it\nis safe.
You kidding me? I'm gonna miss my meeting.
A person on the tracks... What Menace is at\nwork this time?
Ah! What do we do!? With the train stopped\nwe'll never make it in time!
We have no choice. Time to make a\nrisky move.
Nobody's watching. Or rather, the other\npassengers are too distracted to notice us.
Either way, now's our chance. Activate your\nMetaverse Navigator. But just be\ncareful that\u2014
Metaverse Navigator? Got it!
No, wait\u2014!
Yes! I found it!
Did they just disappear...?
We made it to Mementos! What's next,\nCattle!?
Oh god, there's Shadows everywhere!
I said it was a risky move! I wasn't\nfinished explaining...
We'll have to take these Shadows out first!
Phew, we did it... Okay, explain. What did\nyou mean by risky?
It's risky activating the Metaverse\nNavigator somewhere other than the\nstation entrance.
Oh, right. We did activate it from inside\nthe train this time.
There's a reason we always enter the\nMetaverse from Shibuya Station.
By doing so, we can ensure we access\nMementos from the entrance.
If we activate the Metaverse Navigator from\nanywhere else, there's no way to know where\nin Mementos we might end up.
Which means we could end up smack bang in\nthe middle of a swarm of Shadows like we were\njust now... right?
Precisely. Therefore it's the kind of risky\nmove I prefer to avoid where possible.
When Wonder entered the Metaverse for the\nfirst time, we were lucky to end up in\na good spot.
I must say, of all the places to make an\nentrance, this isn't half bad.
Well, no matter. Of course the process is\nimportant, but this job is about results.
Fortunately the entrance to Shibuya Station\nis nearby. Let's exit Mementos from here.
Oh right, that way we can get to the station\non foot.
That's right. Then we can board the train\nfor Shinjuku. Let's hurry.
Yes! We made it to Shibuya just like\nLufel said!
I'll check the route to Shinjuku from here.\nThe emergency stop probably affected other\ntrains too.
Now may also be a good time to prepare\nourselves in advance of any trouble we\nmight face.
I'll leave that to you, {NAME2}.
Oh, are you ready to go?
Cool. Looks like the trains for Shinjuku are\nrunning normally!
Let's hurry!
Gotcha. We should make sure we're prepared.\nJust try your best to hurry!
Okay, Shun-kun. Let me explain to you how\nFood Fight works.
The chef cooks the recipe within the time\nlimit, then I taste it.
If I say, "Thank you," it means you win.\nSimple, right?
"Thank you"... Okay.
The recipe you'll make is Victory Kitchen's\nsignature shoyu ramen. Are you ready?
Now then... Lights, camera... Food Fight!
First, the most important part... the soup.\nTo capture Victory Kitchen's signature taste,\nI have to shave the bonito flakes...
Looking for something?
What happened to the shaver boxes?
Shaver boxes? Ohhh, you mean those stinky\nold cheese grater things?
They're out with the garbage. No need for\nthem here anymore.
Okaaay, let's cut here.
What's with the long face, Shun-kun? Oh, you\nknow what? There is one shaver box I left\nout for display.
It's completely rusted, so I doubt it's\nusable. But if you wanted to try... now that'd\nmake for some pretty good footage.
You bastard!
You left it out to rust!? Pops and Masa-san\ntreasured that thing with their lives!
Their lives? Don't be dramatic. You gonna\nlet pride get in the way of doing your job?
Well? What's it gonna be? You gonna make me\nsome authentic broth or not?
You're welcome to use some of my bargain\nbonito flakes! Ahahahahaha!
Damn it! I can't make Pops's ramen without\na shaver box...
If I have to make some cheap knockoff\nthen... Entering this fight was pointless in\nthe first place!
Chef! What are you doing waiting out here?
You two...
It just started. Shun... He knows he can't\nwin, but he's going through with it anyway.
Shoot! It started already!
The safe...?
Come to think of it, I remember Pops always\nsmiling whenever he opened it...
The soul of Victory Kitchen? What do you mean?
Apparently it's inside the shop safe! It's\nsomething important to Yamagoshi-san.
Come to think of it... Pops would often take\nsomething out of there with a big grin\non his face.
*gasp* Okay! I'll get it!
Hey hey! What's going on? We're in the\nmiddle of shooting!
What are you guys doing here?
*pant* *pant* Kano-kun! You haven't made the\nbroth yet, right!?
Huh? Uh, not yet...
Thank god! We made it in time!
Shun! I found this in the safe... Use it!
This is Pops's...
He took care of it all this time...\nfor me...
Hmph, what's special about that musty\nold thing...
Wow...
What...
Tsk! What are you expecting shaven bonito\nflakes to do?
A good chef doesn't rely on fancy tools or\ningredients. It all boils down to skill.\nDon't you know that?
You think that makes this the "real" soup?\nYou really are beyond help, kid.
Food's getting cold.
Haha! Kano-kun's not fazed a bit!
Tch...
Ahem.
Now then, our contestant's meal is ready for\ntasting!
The contestant claims to have captured the\nauthentic flavor of Victory Kitchen. If I\ndeem that he has truly succeeded...
I will say "Thank you" after eating!
And now, the taste test!
This is...!
The taste from back then... when I was...
This taste... this is it...! Ah...
...Thank you!
Huh? Did he just say it? He said it, right?
No! That was\u2014! I didn't say anything!
I just... said it out of habit! Yeah, that's\nright! I always say that at restaurants!
Cuuut! Just cut that part out! Okay,\ntake two, roll camera!
O-Oh dear, the flavor's just not coming\nthrough! Even with the proper tools, it seems\nthere's just a lack of talent here!
Your bonito flakes have gone to complete\nwaste! In the end, this chef was just a kid\nplaying pretend.
I declare this contestant utterly defeated!
What the\u2014!? Stop screwing around! We all\nheard you! You said, "Thank you"!
Shut up! Don't step on my lines! It makes it\nharder to edit!
Miyazawa-san. You lost. Accept it.
This is exactly the authentic flavor of\nVictory Kitchen. The flavor Shun wanted\nto protect... Pops's flavor!
Shut up! Shut it!
You trying to get fired, Masa!? You know\nwhat? You're all fired! The whole staff!
They have nothing to do with this!
Huh? They got involved the moment they\nsided with you!
And guess whose fault that is. If you didn't\noppose my verdict, Masa and the rest of those\nsad sacks wouldn't have to be canned.
Because of you, eeeveryone gets the short\nend of the stick. It's sad really!
Stop it! You leave Shun alone!
Uh wh-wh-what do we have here? You gonna hit\nme? G-Go ahead. You'll be the next violent\npunk to go viral!
Ugh, screw this. I'm calling the cops. Hey,\nmanager, get the police over here!
I already have evidence of the brat's\nassault! Have them take away his little friends\ntoo while they're at it!
Wha\u2014!? Us!?
You waltzed into the middle of a shoot... You\ninterfered! Um... That's right, you committed\na serious obstruction of business!
I have my crew as witnesses... Now who do\nyou think the cops are going to believe?
Get a hold of yourself! There's no reason to\ndrag children into this!
This is bad. At this rate he's going to call\nthe authorities on us. We need to get Kano\nand escape at once!
Let's get out of here, Kano-kun!
Forget about me. You two run.
I can't stand to cause trouble for everyone\nanymore. I'll stay and take full\nresponsibility for this.
I'm sorry for draggin' you guys into this...\nThanks for everything.
Kano-kun, please come with us!
What if I said there's a way to make him\nhave a change of heart, and confess the truth\nbehind all of his wrongdoing?
Huh? If somethin' like that were possible,\nI would've already...
Wait. Huh? Who just said that...?
Hoo, it seems you really can hear my voice.\nI knew I sensed potential for hope in you.
What...? An owl? Wha\u2014!? Huh!?
Come on, Kano-kun. Let's head outside!
If they're really gonna call the cops, we\nshould get away from here ASAP, right?
What do we do? Can we escape to the\nMetaverse?
I told you it's too risky. If we can at\nleast get to the station...
How is that owl talking...?
Multiple notifications from Pops and\nKatayama-san... I made them worry about\nme again...
Huh? What's this app with the eye icon?
Let's get back to Shinjuku Station. You too,\nKano-kun!
Waaah! Wh-Who are you!?
Motoha Arai? You know that... Wh- Waaaah!
Wait, why are we in our thief outfits? We\ndidn't use the Metaverse Navigator!
Your voice... Is that really you, Arai?
And that means you're... {NAME1}?
Uh, really?
So you guys are into cosplay...?
What? You're not?
No, that voice is definitely {NAME1}.
Wonder?
What is that, your stage name? And why are\nyou talking like that?
Hoomph... Every time you people see thief\nclothes it turns into a "who's the most\nconfounded" contest...
Ewwhaa\u2014!? What is that disgusting hooded\nthing!?
Hoooooo!?
Who are you calling disgusting!? I'll have\nyou know this form represents the pinnacle\nof panache and refinement!
Pssst... Wonder. What's pun ash?
My name is Lufel! Fit that into your\nnoodle-filled skull!
Uh, oh, right...
Hang on a sec... Where are we? How did we\nsuddenly end up here?
We came in by accident, but for better or\nworse, we seem to have landed ourselves\ninside of Miyazawa's Palace.
Which one of you activated the Metaverse\nNavigator?
Wha\u2014!? It wasn't me!
What's with this poster? Is that... me?
Tch, Shadows are starting to close in on us.
I'm not sure if we'll be able to ensure\nKano's safety. I suggest we get out of the\nPalace as soon as possible.
You're right. I know we needed somewhere\nto run, but the middle of a Palace is really\nnot ideal.
We're going, Shun Kano. Come along.
Wha\u2014 Why? Seriously, what the heck's going\non here?
Tch... Okay...
The door's open...? But it was locked\nbefore.
The Food Fight Miyazawa planned to punish\nKano took place in reality, so his cognition\nhas changed to reflect that.
Miyazawa's cognition...?
We can explain later. For now, let's search\nfor an alternative exit.
First...
Who's there!?
...to adorn himself with the blood of\nhis enemies.
Be on your guard. I sense a powerful enemy.
Second, to strike first and win, villainous\nas that may seem.
Third, to fulfill his desire...
...which rivals the brilliance of the\nglittering stars in the heavens.
Hiromu Miyazawa takes the stage!
It's him!
Miyazawa's Shadow!
Miyazawa...?
Serfs, kill them!
No, it's a trap!
Ahahahahahahaha! How marvelous.
A trap most befitting the vile rats that\ndared defile my sacred studio.
Agh, what is this!? A net!?
Disgraceful... I was too focused on the\nincoming Shadows to notice the trap in time!
Wonder, use your knife to cut us out\nof here!
Hahah, that rope is made with reinforced\nthread. A trifling hack and slash isn't\ngoing to cut it.
H-Hey, are you guys all right!?
Look what we have here. Seems the trap\nmissed our little Shun-kun.
How shall we torture you then? Hahahahah!
Are you... really Miyazawa? What's with the\nweird outfit...?
I said it's Miyazawa's Shadow! Essentially a\nmanifestation of Miyazawa's desire!
Manifestation... of desire?
My my, do you think I intend to let you\ninsurgents escape? I said kill them.
What!? What are they!?
Damn! Is this the end...!?
That it is. You rats are hereby sentenced to\ndeath. For the crime of obstruction, you\nshall all face execution.
Execution!? The hell is this bastard\ntalkin' about!?
This is a fortress of his own creation in the\nMetaverse... He has free reign to do whatever\nhe wants. That includes destroying us!
Ahahahahahahaha! That's right! I can do\nanything I want here! This studio was\ndesigned by me, for me!
Do you know what that means, Shun-kun?\nOnce again, thanks to you, everyone has\nended up worse.
Ever since your water-splashing temper\ntantrum, your precious shop has been ripped\napart to the brink of collapse.
And you managed to drag your precious Pops\nand Masa-kun down with you.
I... did...
Hey hey hey! I'm in the middle of my lines!\nNo talking on set!
And what's more, now with Heritage Kitchen\nalso in my hands, poor old Pops's heart is\nat the breaking point!
Every time you get involved you cause misery\nfor everyone around you! Isn't that right,\nShun-kun!?
*whimper*
No! None of this is Kano-kun's fault! This\nwas all part of your plan!
I said quiet on set! How dare you interrupt\nthe leading role's lines!
Arai!
Looks like Loudmouth Brat #2 needs a lesson\nin set etiquette. Hehehehe...
Tch!
Please... You can take out all your anger on\nme. Just please leave them alone!
Huuuh? I didn't quite catch that?
Stop it! Please stop!
Tch... There's no way to fight back with\nthis net in the way!
I'm so sorry, you guys... This is all\nbecause I went against Miyazawa...!
Why...? Why are you defending me...?
That's right! A miserable leech like you\ndoesn't deserve anyone's kindness!
You incurred my wrath, and now you are bound\nto tear down everyone around you. Isn't that\nhow it always goes?
All of it is your fault! All because of you\nand your ridiculous pride over a cheap bowl\nof noodles.
My... pride...?
Yes! Where's your "authentic flavor" now?\nOut with the bathwater, 'cause you spoiled\nthe pot for everyone!
I... did...?
Haha! Don't you get it? Everyone sacrificed\nthings they cared about to protect you.\nThere's no way they'd forgive you!
Not after all you've done for the sake of\nyour precious "pride"! A brat like you\ndoesn't know the meaning of the word!
H-He's right... I ruined the lives of\neveryone around me...
All because of my pride... everyone...
Even {NAME1} and Arai... If I hadn't\ndragged them into this, this never\nwould have...!
That's right! We're here because we wanted\nto be!
You didn't do anything to hurt us, Kano-kun!\nWe chose to help you by our own free will,\nbecause that's what we wanted to do!
You guys...
Remember! Yamagoshi-san and Masa-san have\npride in their ramen!
Are you gonna turn your back on that!?
You know, this is the ramen my late wife\nloved the most.
What do you think of my original ramen?
Mmm! This is incredible, Masa-san. Why\nhaven't you added it to the menu yet?
Haha, thank you. But it's still not as good\nas Pops's.
I want to use everything Pops taught me to\ncreate a ramen I can be proud to call\nmy own...
Then I can make everyone smile with my\ncooking. Just like Pops hoped.
That's right... We were all proud of\nthat flavor...
Making customers smile with our ramen...\nThat was our purpose!
What are you blubbering about!? And you two!\nShut these idiots up already!
Agh...! Shun... Kano! Stop blaming yourself!
The hope that you all called your "pride"...\nJust who is it that stole it away from you!?
S-Stole?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Trying to shift the\nblame onto me, are you!?
If you hadn't defied me, everything would\nhave worked itself out!
Singing the praises of "real flavor from\nreal chefs" like an idiot.
Just looking at you makes me sick! I already\ngave up on trying to be real!
But in the end, all those people who tried\nto crush me...
Calling me a fake... I showed them what a\nfake truly looks like! Ahahahahahahaha!
So, that's why you targeted me?
Just because you threw away what you\ncared about...
How many shops have you shut down? How many\nsmiles have you wiped away?
How many chefs have you stolen pride and\npurpose away from!?
How many people's dreams have you killed to\nspite the one you threw away yourself!?
Yeah. I won't give up anymore!
Everything this bastard has stolen away...\nI'm taking it back!
You finally said it, eh?
You tried to throw everything away...\nYour pride, your hope, your will, even your life...
But you finally figured it out... Wallowing\nin guilt isn't going to change anything!
The bad men won't go away if you shut your eyes...\nThey demand unlawful recompense. You can't play nice!
That mask...!
Your days of giving up are over... From now\non surreptitiously, audaciously, rakishly...
We shall make monarchs stand and deliver!
Now do you remember me? I am thou...
Gah!
*gasp* Kano-kun has a Persona too!?
This power... This passion for life...!
Well now, I think I get the picture.
No no no, my face! You scratched my\nmagnificent face! Gagh!
The lead role can't go on camera like this!\nFinish them while I get my makeup fixed!
Thanks, guys. I finally get it.
Some things are worth protectin'... even if I've\ngotta lean on others. So, will you help me?
Heh, that's what I like to hear.
What's with all the sour faces...
How'd you like a mouthful of lead!?
Let's go! Mandrin!
Wanna see my skills!?
Boiled or fried, I'm servin' bottomless\nbowls of pain!
Nice! We managed to make it out of that mess!\nAll thanks to you, Kano-kun!
What're you talkin' about? I should be\nthankin' you. So, thank you... for havin'\nmy back.
Agh, what the...? I suddenly feel\nso tired...
Your Persona awakened and you fought in\nbattle right afterwards. You're bound to\nbe exhausted.
Still, your battle prowess was singularly\nimpressive, Shun Kano. I have great\nexpectations for your skills.
I know we were just battling together and\nall, but seriously, the hell's with\nthis blowhard?
Well... That's not incorrect per se, but I'm\nnot sure that description will do him\nany good.
You...! I... I've been trying hard to forget\nabout that...
Ahaha. I'm telling you, that's what anyone\nwould think when they first see you.
Anyhoo. Kano is in no state to stick around\nhere, so we should get back to the real\nworld and...
Nooooo!
Wha\u2014 Don't shout like that. We're in\nenemy territory.
Ah, sorry! But I just remembered...
School! We skipped our afternoon classes!
Oh... That's right. I'm sorry for gettin'\nyou guys in trouble.
Yeah, for real. You didn't ask us to chase\nafter you.
Still, we should head back to school. We\nleft our bags and everything there.
By the way, Kano-kun. Ms. Katayama was\nworried about you when she saw the video.
Huh? Katayama-san was?
Yeah. She's the reason we found out about\nthe Food Fight announcement in the\nfirst place.
Really... Okay, I'll have to apologize when\nwe get back to school.
Good, I agree. In that case...
What the\u2014!? He's a car!?
Is this Shibuya...? But we were in Shinjuku.
Ah, thank goodness. Looks like the trains\nare running normally again!
Hey, {NAME1}, can you explain just what\nthe hell is goin\u2014
Shall I do the honors?
Wah! That owl's talking! Wait... Are you...\nLufel?
I am. My form differs between the real world\nand the Metaverse. Now, allow me to enlighten\nyou with the origin of your thief suits\u2014
Hold that thought! School's our top priority\nright now. Classes will finish if we're just\nstanding around here all day!
All right. You better fill me in later, okay?
You three! Where have you been?\nSkipping class without permission...
Ah, Ms. Katayama! We just\u2014 We um\u2014\nWell, we...
I'm so sorry, Ms. Katayama!
Could you please let us off without asking\nwhat happened?
I... We... We all did what we thought was\nthe right thing.
I'll take responsibility for everything.\nPlease accept my apology.
All right. I won't ask. I'll give an\nexplanation to the other teachers.
You can all still make it in time for sixth\nperiod. Hurry over to class now, all right?
And... promise me. The next time you three\nfind yourselves in any kind of trouble, go to\nan adult for help right away. Got it?
All right, get to class.
Let's get back to the classroom, {NAME2}!\nMeet us at the rooftop after sixth period,\nKano-kun!
Hey, no running in the halls!
These kids...
Hehe, but it does take me back.
Is this for real?
Metaverse Navigators, Mementos, Palaces,\nTreasures, and Miyazawa's... Shadow?
I know it sounds kinda hard to believe when\nyou lay it all out like that...
No, I believe it.
Mandrin, our battle in the Metaverse, it was\nall real.
The Phantom Thieves... So that means what\nwent down with that Subway Slammer guy was\nyour doing?
I see. Considering the incident with Noge\ntoo, I believe you.
That's all the information we have to offer\non the subject. Now allow me to ask you\na question...
Shun Kano, would you like to help with our\nnext job?
You mean thieving?
That's the idea. Of course growing our ranks\nwould improve our fighting capabilities...
And now that you know of our identities,\nbringing you into the fold would be\nadvantageous in another sense as well.
Remember what I said when we were up here\nbefore? About wishing Miyazawa would admit\nto his wrongdoing.
Crazy to think I said that to one of the\nguys who changed Kiuchi's heart.
So, can we change Miyazawa's heart\ntoo, {NAME1}?
Then count me in!
Right on!
Yeah. I wanna join the Phantom Thieves.
I wanna help you stop scumbags like Miyazawa\nfrom stealing anyone else's hope.
Hoohoo, welcome aboard.
Woohoo! New member!
Now we'll have to think of a code name\nfor Kano-kun.
Code name?
To protect our real names while working. A\nphantom thief cannot reveal their\ntrue identity.
Whoa, you guys are legit.
I'm Closer, by the way.
Call me Cattle. {PLAYER_NAME} goes\nby Wonder.
We all picked things we thought sounded\nmysterious.
Mysterious, huh...
Then how about "Shoyu"?
Shoyu? You mean like the soy sauce? Why?
In ramen and other foods, one drop of the\nstuff brings the whole dish together. I'd say\nthat makes it pretty mysterious.
What? No good? Don't you think it suits me?\nBeing a chef and all.
Let's... try it out a bit.
Shoyu! Go get it!
It sounds like you're asking someone to\nbuy groceries.
Yeah, I can't call you that...
Well, I don't intend to criticize your\ncreativity, but it just lacks the panache of\na phantom thief.
I recommend choosing something more Germanic\nor Latin inspired to match ours. Otherwise,\nit would feel out of place.
That's a good point...
Well, shoyu is just called soy sauce in\nEnglish, so how about "Soy"?
"Soy"? That could work!
Great. Oh, and Arai, we're the same age and\nall, so you can drop the "-kun."
True. I'll call you Shun then! And you can\ncall me Motoha!
U-Uh, sure... Motoha.
Then I'll call you {NAME2}. Glad to\nwork with ya, {NAME2}.
By the way, is it just me or was\nMs. Katayama super chill today? She took\nShun's excuse without batting an eye.
She's a great teacher. She really saved my\nhide once too.
Katayama-san has a hot-headed side like me.\nShe just gets it, so I don't ever feel the\nneed to lie to her.
Whoa, really? In our class she just seems\npissed all the time...
Wait, do you guys not know about her past?\nShe was pretty well-known for\u2014
Oh! It's Masa-san.
This is Shun.
Sorry, Masa-san, I didn't mean to run off\nwithout cleaning up from the Food Fight...
Don't worry about that. It was all Miyazawa\nand his big mouth. After you left, he really\nmade quite the scene...
But his own crew told him off, and kept him\nfrom calling the police.
Oh...! That's good...
But he was fuming when he left. He'll\nprobably try to stir up some kind of\ntrouble again.
But Shun, you don't need to get involved\nwith him anymore.
No, but!
We'll take care of the rest. Let us adults\ncarry the load.
Your soup was really incredible, Shun.\nThanks for reminding me of what's\nreally important.
Once this all blows over, come back for a\nbite, okay? Later!
What'd Masa-san say?
They stopped Miyazawa from calling the\ncops on us.
Really? Thank god!
But... That doesn't fix the fact that he\nstole the shop and changed the soup.
We have to change his heart. First, we need\nto go looking for this Treasure thing, right?
Yes, but infiltrating the Palace will\ncertainly be risky. We ought to\nprepare thoroughly.
Fortunately, with the police issue\neliminated, we've freed up time to make the\nproper arrangements.
I'll leave the decision of when we should\nhead for Miyazawa's Palace to you, {NAME2}.
All right. Countin' on ya, {NAME2}.
Okay! From here on out the Phantom Thieves\nare four members strong. Now let's change\nsome hearts!
Goooo team!
So if we steal that thing, it'll change\nMiyazawa's heart? You said it was the reason\nfor his twisted desires, right?
Anyway, don't you guys think this Palace is\nkinda weird? With the castle set, and the\nmovie posters...
Kiuchi's Palace being a baseball stadium I\nget, but... What, is Miyazawa just into\nperiod pieces or something?
I see. So he puts on a character for his\nshows. That likely has something to do with\nthe cause of his corruption.
Hah. Only Miyazawa'd be satisfied playing\ndress-up as king of a made-up castle.
Welp, let's go find that Treasure, huh? For\nPops and Masa-san too.
Oh, that means this is the place, right,\nCattle?
Yes. I can sense it. Miyazawa's Treasure\nis here.
Uh, where though...?
That's right. The next step is sending the\ncalling card to make the Treasure\nmaterialize.
Calling card?
Now that we've secured our route to the\nTreasure, I'll explain the details once we\nreturn to reality.
Leader, it's up to you whether we continue\nexploring or return to the real world now.
You like sweet stuff, huh, Shun?
Yeah, I get pretty hungry after using\nmy head.
Since desserts are outside my area of\nexpertise, I can enjoy them without\nover-thinkin' how they were made.
I get all nitpicky about savory dishes. The\nsource of the ingredients, the way they're\ncut, and stuff like that...
Ahhh, 'cause you see it from a chef's\nperspective.
Anyhoo, what's it you were sayin' about\nmakin' the Treasure materialize?
Right, I will explain.
First we need to agree on changing the\nPalace ruler's heart by unanimous decision.
Forcibly remolding another human's mind is\nnot an act that should be taken lightly.
Ahhh...
So, what say all of you? Are you in favor of\nthe change of heart or not?
Absolutely in favor. I have no objections.
Of course for Pops and Masa-san's sake...\nbut also for all the other shops he's\nhurt too.
I agree. We can't let Miyazawa go on\nlike this.
Okay, I'm in favor as well. That means we've\nreached a consensus. We will change\nMiyazawa's heart.
So the next step is the calling card.
Once it's delivered and the target\nrecognizes their Treasure is under threat of\nbeing stolen, it will materialize.
It'd be best if we could get it to him\ndirectly, but obviously we don't know where\nhe lives, so...
Even if we knew where he worked, he's\nalways runnin' around filming at different\nlocations.
Oh! What if Lufel drops them from the sky\nabove the station like last time?
I already told {NAME2}, but I am not going\nto expose myself like that again.
If our true identities get revealed, we're\nfinished. It's too risky for many reasons...
...but mostly because it hurt my muscles.
Oof, that's so real!
Well, okay, fine. Hmmm, what should we\ndo then?
Oh, it's a notification for Miyazawa's\nchannel! He uploaded some new video!
Afternoon, everyone! This is Katana Tongue\nMiyazawaaaa!
About the upcoming Food Fight video you've\nall been patiently awaiting... I am so sorry!
Due to technical difficulties we were unable\nto capture the fight on film! Please forgive\nme as I present just the results...
The contestant was, of course, defeated!\nTheir taste was an embarrassing offense to\na true palate!
That asshole...
Well, it's not like I expected him to tell\nthe truth anyway.
Now, in place of that video, I will be doing\na live broadcast on the channel!
At the same Victory Kitchen shop from my\nlast Food Fight, I will be unveiling a huuuge\nannouncement!
I'm bringing that incredible flavor all over\nthe country in the form of a brand new chai\u2014\nWhoops, can't say any more!
Look out for the details on my social media\nin the coming days! I hope you're all\nexcited!
Anyhoodle, this is Katana Tongue Miyazawa,\nsigning off!
"Can't say any more"? He basically just\nspilled the whole thing! A chain restaurant?\nAre you kidding me!?
I can't let him spread that fake soup around\nthe country under Pops's name!
Hey, doesn't that mean Miyazawa will\ndefinitely be at Victory Kitchen on the\nday of the broadcast?
Oh...! I still have the key to Victory\nKitchen too!
If I sneak in there the night before and\nleave the calling card, then...
Miyazawa will definitely see it!
All right, sounds like a plan.
Before Miyazawa announces the date, let's\nall make sure we've prepared everything we\u2014
Wait! One more thing!
Yes?
With Shun on the team now and the Phantom\nThieves getting bigger, what do you guys\nthink about making a logo for ourselves?
Logo...?
You mean designing some kind of symbol to\nstand as the mark of the Phantom Thieves?
Yes, exactly! Like how baseball uniforms\nhave logos that unify the team!
Woo! Then it's settled.
But now the question is, who's going to draw\nit? I myself wouldn't know where to begin\nwith detailed work like that.
Same here. My grades in art class are\nalways crap.
I think my drawing on Kiuchi's calling card\nmade it pretty clear to everyone where my\nskills land so...
Oh, great leader Wonder-sama! Please deliver\nus from crappy artwork!
Huh? You'll do it!? Yes! You're the best,\n{NAME2}! I'll go buy some pens and paper!
I had no idea you possessed that kind of\nability. Well then, we'll leave the design\nof our thieves' emblem to you.
Make us somethin' good, {NAME2}!
Now all there is to do is wait for the broadcast date to be announced.
This is our second job as the Phantom\nThieves. To get the world's attention, let's\nmake sure to do it in style.
It looks like the announcement for\nMiyazawa's live broadcast is coming soon...\nAre you ready for it?
Ahhhhh. Shaking up the food world as a\nfamous critic is just so exhausting...
I gave another shop a thorough slicing\ntoday, but the question is... how do we make\nmoney off it?
We're filming at Victory Kitchen after this,\nright?
Yes, sir. And I'm sure yesterday's social\nmedia announcement has got all your fans on\nthe edges of their seats.
We've also paid people to line up outside\nthe restaurant.
Heheh, you've really turned your attitude\naround, huh?
Well, let's get over there. I'm sure the\nnews about the chain deal's bound to blow\neveryone away.
I can hear the sweet jingle of money rolling\nin already.
Well helloooo there, thank you for calling!\nI'm sorry, this is about the Food Fight\nvideo, isn't it?
Yes, we filmed it, but there was a mistake\nwe just couldn't edit around...
Huh? O-Ohhh, the replacement we talked\nabout. Ummm, well, obviously things didn't\nwork out with the Food Fight, but...
I have photos and plenty of other evidence\nwe could use to get the firestorm going...\nRight?
No no no, nothing's gonna change my mind.\nI'm nothing like that washed up\nbaseball hack!
The fame that eluded me for so long is\nfinally mine thanks to Divine Justice...!
So once I find you your replacement, you'll\npropose my film to the entertainment\nproduction committee...? Hello...?
Oh sure, hang up on me, why don't you!?
Whatever. Money'll start flooding in anytime\nnow. That ought to show them...
Live in three... two...
Helloooo, everyone! Welcome to Katana Tongue\nMiyazawa's live channel!
Today I'm bringing you a huge announcement,\nbroadcasted live to you from here in\nShinjuku!
Hold onto your socks, people, cause they're\nabout to blow off when I tell you...
Victory Kitchen is officially becoming a\nchain!
Victory Kitchen, the shop entrusted to me\nafter its owner fell gravely ill...
Its authentic flavor can now be shared with\nmillions across the country!
We have lots of festivities planned at the\nshop tonight, so without further delay,\nlet's head inside!
My my, what a crowd! Proof that the flavor\nwe worked so hard to perfect is loved\nby many.
Hello there, 'scuse me!
What the\u2014!?
What the hell is this!? This was not in\nthe script...!
"Sir Hiromu Miyazawa, celebrity critic,\nsinner of vanity, lying bastard."
"You have robbed countless chefs of their\npride and purpose, and wiped the smiles off\ncustomers' faces."
"You are a crook who defrauds the public\u2014\nlining your pockets and padding your ego with\nthe hopes you've stolen from them.
"For this, you will not go unpunished. We,\nthe Phantom Thieves, will take your twisted\ndesires without fail."
Whaaat is thiiiiiis!?
And this dumbass symbol...!
Huh!? These weren't some surprise you\nprepared for the broadcast, sir!?
That's why we didn't take them down...
Y-You idiot! Of course it isn't! Take this\nall down at once! And stop the camera!
Take my desires, you say? Don't make\nme laugh!
After all this time I finally got my break...\nI'm one step away from stardom...! You think\nI'd ever let you take that from me!?
Wow, I was not expecting that. What's the\n"Phantom Thieves" anyway?
Oh, I recognize this! There was a calling\ncard just like this for the Subway Slammer!
Okay... Miyazawa has most certainly seen the\ncalling card. With this, the Treasure should\nhave manifested in the Metaverse.
And he disgraced himself in front of his\nprecious live audience. That was a\nnice touch.
But the real fight's still ahead. Are you\nready, {NAME2}?
There it is! The Treasure!
That's the Treasure? Looks like some kind\nof film reel...
Based on the Palace's interior, it would\nseem the source of Miyazawa's warped desire\nstems from movies.
Yeah! There're no Shadows around. This is\nour chance!
First, to adorn himself with the blood of\nhis enemies...
Second, to speak first and win, villainous\nas that may seem...
Which rivals the brilliance of the\nglittering sta\u2014 Ach!?
Woo! Strike one!
Aghhh...! How dare you sully the money maker\nof the world's next big super star!?
And how dare you disrupt the lead's critical\nscene!? What is this, amateur hour!?
Who cares!? You've been destroying\neveryone's hopes and dreams, so shut it!
Hand it over, Hiromu Miyazawa. All the hope\nyou've stolen. Now!
Hah! There you go again, ooon and ooon about\n"hopes" and "dreams" and "rainbows"! The\nonly ones buying that fairytale nonsense...
Are gullible little brats like you. If you\nknew how the world really works you'd have\ngiven up already.
You stinking rug rats don't have a clue. The\npen may be mightier than the sword, but this\nblade will write you out of existence!
Can you hear it? That's the voice of my\ndemonic blade, aching to drain the lifeblood\nfrom your wretched bodies!
Guess we're gonna have to fight!
Just fry him till he's crispy, but not\nscorched, right?
Order up!
Tch... How dare you try to upstage the main\ncharacter! You damn bit players!
Ah...! Here's an idea. How about a few\nflavor substitutes to bring out the umami!
This is getting out of hand! Now there are\nthree of them!
I can barely stomach just one of him.\nThis is bad...
So you're just gonna hide among your fakes?\nYou coward!
Gah! H-How did you find me? Is my star power\njust that bright...?
Somethin' smells. Must be your dirty rotten\nlies!
Ahahaha! I got you... You can't tell the\nreal thing from a cheap copy after all!
Fools... Defeating my decoy only restores my\npower. Ignorance is a sin, isn't it?\nAhahaha!
Gyah...! This... wasn't in... my\nscreenplay...
Your screenplay's a bloated vanity project.\nA sham hacked together with lies and\ntissue paper.
I have no mercy for you. For all the hopes\nyou've stolen... Confess!
Aaah... Aaaaaah...!
No...! No! You can't! It's my only...!
If that's how it's gonna be...
I'll have to show you my real ugly side!
Did he unleash his true form!?
Good. I'm sick of fighting a phony.
You smug little rats...! I'll cut you all\ndown to si\u2014
I'll flay you and your fake flavor fair\nand square.
Bring it on!
I'll chop you all up into pieces!
Slash, slash, slash, slash, slaaash!
I'll slice your precious pride into\nmincemeat!
You cheeky little brats...! I'll chop you all\nto bits!
It's time for the grand finale... This will\nbe my award-winning scene!
With this blade, harder than steel...\nI'll put an end to you villains!
Who're you callin'... The real villain who\nstole the desires of so many people is you!
Wait, this doesn't look good!
That was bad... Everyone all right?
I'm holdin' on somehow. But if we take\nanother hit like that...
He won't be able to do that again anytime\nsoon. Look for an opening and press\nthe attack!
Hmm. Is it time to roll credits already?
An epic climax needs some supporting\ncharacters as well... Heh, the star will take\na back seat for now.
Just wait until my grand re-entrance...\nOops, no spoilers!
Hidin' back there like a coward...! Come out\nand face us fair and square!
We don't know what he'll do. Stay calm and\nobserve the enemy's movements!
Shit, shit, SHIT! Such lousy acting...\nYou amateurs have no right to stand here!
You guys are just disposable extras to make\nthe real star shine!
Everything in this world is my\nshining stage...
Anyone who sullies my stage? Die\npathetically, miserably, and without desire!
Hahahaha!
What!? What's he doing now?
Looks like he's finally stopped hidin'. That\nmeans we can go all out!
No, wait. I sense the same... or even\ngreater power from him than before.
Keep your guard up! Get ready!
Well? How d'you like that!?
Climax after climax... This is the true\nessence of a silver screen actor!
Grrr...!? N-no way, me, the leading man...\nforced into a corner...!?
*pant* *pant* Let me... take five...
There, now's our chance! Take him down!
Let me do this. I'll go somewhere I can get\na clear shot.
You want to go on your own? It could be\na risk... What do you think, Wonder?
Got it, leave it to me!
He changed back...?
Yes, this means we stopped the Shadow from\nrampaging! Now we just have to steal\nthe Treasure!
Huh.
Uch... Ngh...
Agh... I can't move anymore... You win...\nJust take it and get out of here...
Could you hold on a sec, Wonder? There's\nsomethin' I've gotta ask him.
Hey, Miyazawa.
Tell me why this film was so important\nto you.
Huh...? Why do you care?
I want to know why you started crying at\nthe Food Fight.
I always... dreamed of being a movie star.
I left the countryside for the city, hoping\nto become a star on the silver screen... Like\nthe ones I saw in films as a child...
Heh... But I was never that good-looking...\nso the only roles I ever got were background\nextras...
No matter how hard I tried, I could never\nbecome a "real" actor, worthy of a\nstarring role...
Always rejected... Always broke...\nAlways starving...
I had to throw away my pride to survive...\nI'd suck up to all the actors who made\nit big...
Get them to buy me expensive meals...\nAll the while crying to myself over how\npathetic I was...
But thanks to that... I was able to develop\nmy palate...
And that's why you became a\ncelebrity critic?
At first it was just local TV programs...\nI started off giving proper, honest reviews.
Over time I started to gain popularity... But\nas I discovered different restaurants, I\nfound myself getting so irritated...
The chefs in the kitchen... They shined...\njust like the real stars I used to idolize...
With a twinkle in their eye and pride in\ntheir heart, they followed their own path\nwithout looking back...
So that's what made you target\nVictory Kitchen?
Yes... You splashing water on me had nothing\nto do with it. Victory Kitchen's authentic\nflavor made me feel all the more phony...
I couldn't face the truth... That I was a\nfake... That I threw away my pride as\nan actor...
I'm sorry, Shun-kun... I'm sorry to everyone\nat Victory Kitchen... I'm the real fake...
I told lie after lie and got so caught in my\nown web that I couldn't turn back...
I'm nothing but a foolish, rotten,\nasinine... villain. I don't deserve to\nlive anymore...
I'm not going to forgive you. But...
You... acknowledged my ramen. You couldn't\nlie to yourself about what you tasted.
The reason you've made it as far as you\nhave... is because of something you couldn't\nturn your back on in that moment...
Your tongue. Your real sense of taste you've\nspent years cultivating.
No one is born a true professional at\nanything.
The strong desire to become one... is what\ngives a person pride and purpose.
The desire to become one...
As people, we have all these dreams and\naspirations, but we also know that some\nthings in life don't always work out.
We can't control what talents we're born\nwith, or if some accident leaves us injured\nand aimless. Sometimes we just quit...
But we never let go of hope. We find new\npurpose for ourselves, put all our energy\ninto chasing it, and keep on living.
I understand how desperate it feels to\nstruggle like that... but it doesn't make\nstealing hope from other people right.
You should apologize to every shop you made\nsuffer, and take back all your false reviews.
Tell the truth about everything that\nhappened... Seriously reflect on your\nactions, and atone for your crimes...
Then come back to my shop as a true\ncelebrity critic. I'll be the judge of what a\nproud gourmet celebrity you've become.
And if you end up broke, I'll give you a\nbowl of ramen on the house.
One so delicious it makes you cry.
*sob*
You kids really are optimistic...
I'm sorry... Truly... I'll confess to\neverything. I'll make it all right again...
He vanished...?
Yes. The Shadow returned to the real\nMiyazawa's heart.
Thanks. Sorry for dragging things out.
I didn't want to end it by just beating him\nup... I wanted to understand where he was\ncoming from before changing his heart.
Waaah! Is this the same thing that happened\nwith Kiuchi?
Yes, the Palace is collapsing. We have to\ntake the Treasure and get out of here!
Huh? Collapsing...?
Soy, hurry! Stick around and you'll end\nup a pancake!
Wha\u2014!? Start with that!
Saaafe! That was really close!
Haaah... I think hangin' around with you\nguys has really increased my stamina...
Thank god this Treasure wasn't as big as\nthe last one.
Oh right! Where's the Treasure!?
That's Miyazawa's...
Huh? What do you mean?
Apparently there are seven Treasures in\ntotal. So there are five more Palace rulers\nout there somewhere.
Seriously!? That's a long way to go. And it\nmeans there are more people out there\nlike Miyazawa?
Yeah. The police won't do anything about\nthem, so that leaves it to the\nPhantom Thieves.
By the way, Cattle. Have any more memories\ncome back to you?
But to be frank, they're quite jumbled.\nI think I may have been... wrong.
Hm. That's weird. Wouldn't expect to hear\nCattle say something like that.
We can't have a calm discussion standing\nhere like this. Let's talk about it once we\nleave the Metaverse.
Wait...
Where did we go wrong...?
Wonder, stop...!
We don't wanna forget you!
What's wrong? You okay?
Ha, even our fearless leader's exhausted,\nhuh?
You were staring into space again.\nIs everything all right?
Come on, I'm sure Wonder must be tired too.\nHe's always busting his butt as leader.
Need to lean on my shoulder?
Okay. Well, just lemme know if you need\na hand.
We're about to enter a wider area, so we'll\nuse my car form from there.
Thanks Cattle! I'm actually pretty wiped\ntoo...
I can't believe it's this late...
Ugh... They took up so much time making\nsmall talk after the meeting...
My editor is such a Menace...
What is this?
I-I'm fine!
Sorry, that was my bad!
Hey...
Ah! I've gotta grab my stuff!
Miyazawa's Treasure... This is what twisted\nhis desires, huh?
Something wrong, Soy?
Yeah... I mean, no.
I was just thinkin'... Obviously I can't\ncondone anything he's done, and I don't\nregret changing his heart either.
But with all his hope and passion\nfor acting...
If things had gone well for him, do ya think\nhe'd have turned out differently...?
Right... I wonder the same thing about\nKiuchi. Seems like he loved baseball ever\nsince he was a kid.
That's the passion that drove him to become\na professional player, and ultimately\ncorrupted his desires...
You know, the first time I heard Awilda's\nvoice, I felt like I found answers\nfor myself.
What it is I really wanna do... What's so\nimportant I can't throw it away...
It was the same for me.
It's hard to explain, but I feel like\n"desire" itself isn't always a bad thing.
Corrupted desires...
Whoa! I didn't know you could speak through\nthere like that, Cattle.
O-Oh right... We're kind of inside Cattle's\nbody... Sort of...
Wonder, eyes on the road please.
As I was saying...
Hypothetically speaking... And I mean,\nhypothetically...
What if someone were... making people's\ndesires get corrupted?
Huh? "Making" them get corrupted?
It's just speculation, but... when I touched\nMiyazawa's Treasure I...
Cattle...?
Forget it. Like I said, it's pure\nspeculation. I shouldn't be sharing\nunverified information with you.
Caaattle! You can't say mysterious stuff and\nthen expect us to forget about it!
Sorry... You're right.
When I touched Miyazawa's Treasure...
I sensed the influence of another\nhuman being.
Well, from my logic... I believe there was\nsomeone pulling his strings from behind\nthe scenes.
Pulling his strings?
In other words, a person who purposely\ncorrupted Miyazawa's desires and caused his\nTreasure to form.
You mean like...!
Whoa whoa whoa! You mean someone made\nMiyazawa do all those bad things!?
Then... Kiuchi too!? Someone intentionally\ncorrupted him!?
I told you, I'm not certain. If only I could\nremember everything...
However, I did notice that just before\nMiyazawa's Shadow disappeared it said, "They\ncut ties with me."
Right... Somethin' about how with that\nperson gone he was free to start over...
So... There really is someone behind\nall this?
Let's put a pin in this conversation for\nnow. In the meantime I'll try to make sense\nof the memories that came back to me.
We should be reaching the exit any\nmoment now.
Huh? The heck is this?
A movie ticket stub...? Why do I have this?
The same thing happened with Kiuchi's.\nComing back to the real world makes the\nTreasure return to its original form.
What!? This scrap of paper is Miyazawa's\nTreasure!?
Wait... That's right. He said he looked up\nto the movie stars he watched as a kid.
Yes. That dream became distorted in his mind,\nand his Shadow went out of control. That led\nhim to act out in the real world.
So, if someone really did manipulate\nMiyazawa... Then they're the reason he ended\nup that way, right?
Speculatively! But yes, that is what I think.
It's possible that person could be watching\nus this very minute.
Huh!? Wait, what!? You mean we're being\nwatched here in the real world?
It's a possibility. We have stolen twisted\ndesires from two people already.
If this... mastermind truly is orchestrating\nthings behind the scenes, it would be logical\nto assume that we may be on their radar.
Right. Here we're just regular\nhigh schoolers and an owl.
If they're somebody powerful, or part of\nsome big organization, we won't stand a\nchance against them.
Oh god... What should we do?
That's right. I'm glad we can count on you\nto keep a level head, Leader.
Yeah. Guess it's best to trust our\nidentities are safe and stick to business\nas usual.
If we're obviously acting cautious, it'll\nlook suspicious.
Oh right! That makes sense...
Ooookaaaay! Time for a mood change! I'm\nbeat, so I'mma head home and hit the hay!
That was so unnatural...
We just said to act normal...
Hm? That was normal for me.
And there's no homework today, so I can take\na long bath and sleep like a rock!
Oh crap I forgot... My class has math\nhomework for Katayama-san...
Oof. RIP...
I don't know if I can get any of the answers\nright, but I guess I should try. I owe her\nafter all.
I'll get goin' then. See ya guys!
I'm headin' home too. {NAME2}, Lufel,\nsee you at school!
Back to everyday life just like that...\nTalk of this mastermind didn't seem to deter\nthose two one bit.
So, shall we head home as well, {NAME2}?
Hoo, chats are quite the convenient\ncontrivance. People can relay thoughts to\neach other without meeting in person.
But keeping in mind that our actions may be\nbeing observed... We should maintain a degree\nof caution in our virtual communications.
From now on we should consider planning out\nour actions more carefully.
Yes. We need an advisor. Someone to act as\na sort of brain, managing the functions of\nthe Phantom Thieves...
No, we've been succeeding on improv and luck\nup until now.
We need an advisor. Someone to act as a sort\nof brain, managing the functions of the\nPhantom Thieves...
Motoha relies more on her intuition\nthan logic.
We need someone who can deduce this\npuppet master's way of thinking and\nanticipate their next move.
Shun seems sharp, but he doesn't strike me\nas a strategist.
His deep compassion makes it hard to imagine\nhim pulling one over on this mastermind.\nThat takes Shun out of the running.
Of course I'm not an unreasonable\ncandidate...
However, sorting my returning memories,\nstudying the Metaverse... That is truthfully\nwhere I want to focus my efforts.
You are not a candidate for advisor either.
We've successfully recovered two Treasures\nnow. That's thanks to your contribution as\nteam leader.
Therefore, I want you to continue focusing\non commanding the Phantom Thieves.
Hoohoo, that's my way of saying you're a\nreliable leader. I have high hopes for your\nefforts going forward.
Now then, let's get to sleep.
Huh? Miyazawa retired?
Yeah, it's all over the internet.
Apparently all his food reviews on TV and\nonline were total lies...
Also, he tried to steal the rights to the\nrestaurants he shut down, and made buttloads\nof money ripping people off.
Talk about a full-course crime... Oh yeah,\nhe was condemned as a Menace, wasn't he?
It actually made him popular for a while.\nBut I guess pull back the curtain and he's\njust a regular, rotten Menace.
Witnessing the fruits of our labor as a\nteam? Not a bad suggestion. I'll join you.
I, Hiromu Miyazawa, for the cruel and\ninsensitive conduct I have perpetrated\nagainst several restaurants...
The terrible turmoil my actions have caused\nthem, their families, and friends...
And for the horrible crimes I've committed...\nI sincerely apologize.
I am so, so very sorry!
I know my apology can't possibly make up\nfor all I've done...
But starting today, I will be retiring from\nall media platforms.
To everyone I've hurt through my egoistic\nbehavior, I am truly, deeply sorry.
Miyazawa-san! Does this mean all of the bad\nreviews from your internet and television\nappearances were fabricated?
Is it true you extorted large sums of money\nfrom restaurants in exchange for\nretracting reviews!?
Yes, it's true.
Your reviews put several restaurants out of\nbusiness. How do you respond to this?
I don't know how I can ever make it up to\nthem, but I want to make everything right...
Why confess now? What caused this sudden\nchange of heart?
The cause...? It was...
Phantom... Thieves...
I mean... I feel like someone took the evil\nout of my heart...
Did you just say "Phantom Thieves"?
Is this related to their calling card seen\nin your announcement for the Victory Kitchen\nchain?
*sob* *weep*
Miyazawa-san! Please stop crying and answer\nthe question!
I can't believe it... Miyazawa really\nconfessed to everything...
His heart's completely changed...\nIncredible...
We heard about Kiuchi's confession through\nthe news. But actually seeing it firsthand\nis something else...
Thanks again, you guys. This means I can\nbring Pops some good news.
That's right! We got this far cause we all\nworked together! Thanks to you too, Shun!
I haven't felt this at peace in a while.\nThis is like I-finished-all-my-\nhomework-level peace...
Dammit! I didn't finish the math homework\nfor Katayama-san!
Huh? I thought you said you did what\nyou could...
Sure, I tried. Couldn't solve a single\nproblem though!
Wait... Is Shun actually noodle-brained?
You're one to talk!
Nuh-uh! I got an overall GPA of 1!
That's failing!
*sigh* Good grief... No telling how things\nwill turn out with this motley crew.
Well, you're right about that.
I'll still be counting on you to lead us\nfrom now on, {NAME2}.
I didn't fail! I made it just over the mark!
That's nothin' to be proud of!
Good, you're all here.
So what is it? Why'd you make us come all\nthe way up here?
Remember what I told you about the\nmastermind?
Your theory that someone's manipulating\npeople's desires to bring about more Palaces?
Precisely. We can't risk that person\ndiscovering our true identities.
So, going forward I would like us to avoid\ndiscussing our work in front of others\nwherever possible.
Oh yeah. I guess someone could overhear us in\nclass or the hallways.
But no one really comes up here, so we\nshouldn't have to worry. Plus it's nice and\nroomy.
On that note, I have a proposition.
I think we should use this roof as our\ntemporary hideout.
Yes. We'll limit discussion of work-related\nand other important matters to this location.
Besides, don't you think a secret hideout\ngives us more voguish charm as phantom\nthieves?
There it is. Lufel's word of the day,\nsponsored by ye olde dictionary.
Naturally! We can hardly call ourselves\nphantom thieves without a hideout!
It's the epitome of elegance. Can you imagine\nanything else with such voguish charm?
You think voguish is a hard word?
Well, anyway, the roof hideout's a good idea.\nI guarantee no one comes around here at\nlunchtime.
Oh that's right, Shun's been eating his\ncup ramen up here for a while now.
I don't come here much, but it's so nice\neating out in the fresh air!
So you two are fine with just cup ramen and\na piece of bread?
Want some of my lunch?
No thanks. I don't wanna distract from the\nflavor of the ramen.
Okay! Have some of my rolled omelet! Not to\ntoot my own horn, but it's kinda\nmy specialty.
Hoohoo! Cooked it yourself then, did you?\nIn that case, I wouldn't mind helping myself\nto some of that meat.
Ah, but I only have one sausage. Well,\nI guess I can split it in half.
You shouldn't hold back among comrades,\n<NAME2>. On that note, I won't hesitate\nto help myself to some of that meat.
Ah, but I only have one sausage. How about\nmy rolled omelet? It's my specialty!
Hoom... A compromise, is it? Very well.\nI accept your terms.
{NAME2}, Motoha made all this food herself,\nso I'll share some with you too.
So, Lufel, are we here because you have\nsomething to tell us?
Yes. It's about our next target. Or rather,\nit will be once we've found them...
Well, the first thing we have to do is\nfigure out who the next Palace ruler is,\nright?
There're still five more scumbags like\nMiyazawa out there.
Speaking of which, we should be able to use\nthe Treasure we secured from him to\naid our search.
It should allow us entrance to a new area\nof Mementos.
And that's where our next target's Palace\nwill be? Good enough for me. Let's go\nright after school today.
Right. Call everyone together when you're\nready to head out, Leader.
Oh, unrelated, but did you guys hear we're\ngetting a new teacher soon?
New teacher? In the middle of the\nschool year?
Yeah. Tomoko told me. Apparently he's not\na regular teacher.
Not a regular teacher? What does that mean?
I'm not really sure, but I don't think he's\ngoing to be teaching classes.
A teacher who doesn't teach? What's the\npoint of him coming here then?
Oh yeah! That makes sense. I bet that's\nwhat it is!
A class observer, huh? I guess\nit's possible...
Wait, is it though?
Oh, now you're talkin'! That would be great!
You're so transparent...
Ah, fifth period's starting. See you guys\nafter school!
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, teachers.\nI'm Yamanashi, the academic coordinator.
This is Mr. Akashi.
He'll be working here starting today.
Hello, my name is Kei Akashi. I look forward\nto working with you all.
Mr. Akashi is an educational consultant\nsent by the school board.
"Educational consultant"?
Yes. It's probably an unfamiliar term,\nso allow me to give a brief explanation.
As I'm sure you all know, the overworking of\nteachers has become a major issue in\nrecent years.
Between their classroom responsibilities,\nadministrative tasks, and club advising,\nthey don't get enough time off.
Then there are problems on campus and\nparental complaints. It all takes a heavy\nmental toll.
You said it! Do you know how often I have\nto take work home with me? I could\ndrop dead any minute!
I gave up and accepted the fact that I'll\nalways be busy at this job, but dealing with\nparent calls is a serious pain.
I see you all have all have some problems\nyou're dealing with.
Many teachers are leaving the profession\nthese days, and few are lining up to\nreplace them.
The school board sent me to help address\nthese problems at the source.
From today on, I'll be working to identify\nproblems like unnecessary work and\neliminating them.
The goal is to create an environment where\ninstructors can focus on teaching\ntheir students.
So you'll be instituting work reforms?
If I thought it'd actually make my life\neasier, I'd be all for it.
Mr. Akashi will be introduced to the\nstudents tomorrow as a temporary\neducational advisor.
Thank you very much. I'm looking forward\nto hearing what the students have to say.
And please be aware that I may need to\nvisit your classrooms during your lessons.
If it means making less work for us, then\nyou're more than welcome. Right,\nMs. Katayama?
Yes. If it means being able to focus more of\nour attention on the students...
I hope you're not thinking of making more\nunauthorized home visits, Ms. Katayama.
We received a complaint from a parent\nyesterday saying their child's homeroom\nteacher just showed up at their doorstep!
That student has excessive absences and\nfrequently leaves school early.
I called the parents several times, but they\ndidn't answer, so I went to speak with them.
You went to their house for that!? Do you\nnot see how inappropriate that is!?
Students need to be looked after at home\nand at school.
If a parent consistently ignores calls from\ntheir child's teacher, it can be indicative\nof problems at home.
If his homelife is the cause of his issues\nat school, then it's up to us teachers\nto intervene!
All right, all right. That's enough, Ms...
Kumi Katayama, is it?
What is that?
Oh, my apologies. These are smart glasses.\nBasically a smartphone for your eyes.
I was just using them to check the roster\nI was given.
I... see...
You can't go to parent's homes, Ms. Katayama.\nIt's against regulations.
What!?
Especially impromptu visits. Putting pressure\non families can create more resistance\ntoward attending school.
If needed, the school counselor and other\nqualified professionals should deal with\nthe situation.
I want to resolve things before they become\nthat dire. That's why I need to meet\nwith the parents!
*sigh* That's not how things are\ndone anymore.
Just having a teacher come to your house is\na big deal these days.
If you pay too much attention to one\nstudent, you'll end up neglecting the others,\nwon't you?
But children need adults to look out for\nthem. If he doesn't feel safe at home...
I can't just leave him to fend for himself!
All right already! We're going in circles\nhere. Mr. Akashi agrees with me!
From now on, no unsolicited home visits!\nAvoid meeting students outside of school,\nperiod! Are we clear!?
That goes for the rest of you too. Now get\nback to work, everyone.
I'll be off now. I'm looking forward to\nworking with you, Ms. Katayama.
Kumi Katayama... My intel was right. She'll\nmake for perfect fodder.
I should let them know. Hopefully everything\ngoes to plan.
Everyone, be quiet. I have an announcement\nabout tomorrow...
Club's got me so burnt out.
Hey, wanna go to karaoke today?
Settle down. I said I have something\nto announce.
I said pipe down, didn't I!?
There will be a school-wide morning assembly\ntomorrow, so don't be late.
Well, that's it for today. Everyone,\nget home safe and sound.
Yikes.
The hell was that?
Seems like Ms. Katayama's in a bad mood.
Well, I feel bad everyone was being so\nnoisy, but it was kinda startling the way she\nblew up like that.
Well, yeah. Nobody listened to her.
Katayama's kinda scary, huh? Maybe she's\ngot anger issues.
You don't wanna mess with a hot-head\nteacher like that. What a Menace.
You're right! She's a total Menace!
You wait till Katayama-san leaves the room\nto start bad-mouthing behind her back?
Tsk.
Don't be so pathetic.
What're we doin' today? Metaverse?
Uh, we just gonna blaze past your\nspectacular entrance?
That cowardly crap just pisses me off.\nIf you're gonna talk shit, say it to the\nperson's face.
So, what do you think? I say if we can get\nto the next area, let's give it a go.
Now that we have Miyazawa's Treasure, we\nshould be able to enter the next area.
First we should head to the furthest edge of\nthe second area. Let's go, Wonder.
Whoa! It opened!
A new area has been confirmed.\nUpdating guidance information.
Wait. Did the Metaverse Navigator just talk?
Oh, yeah. Apparently it keeps track of when\nwe discover new places too.
Ah... That's cool and all, but isn't it\nkinda creepy?
The hell's with this app anyway? There's no\nreception in the Metaverse, but it works\njust fine.
Oh. True. I didn't really think about it\nbefore, but that's super weird.
It just appeared on my phone one day and\nkept coming back every time I deleted it.
Do you know something about it, Cattle?
No, I only know as much as you do. It could\nbe part of the memories I lost.
Only those with strong desires can use the\nMetaverse Navigator. That's the extent of\nmy knowledge on the subject.
So basically, we know nothing.
It's kinda freaky that even Cattle doesn't\nunderstand it.
And look at this creepy icon! What is that,\na snake?
Hoom. The looped snake motif reminds me\nof an ouroboros.
Ouroboros?
A snake biting its own tail to form a circle.
It devours itself and is reborn in an\neternal loop. It symbolizes the cyclical\nnature of the universe.
But this snake isn't biting its tail.
Hoo? Ah, I suppose you're right.
So it's not an ouroboros, but just a regular\nsnake monster?
What kinda deeper meaning?
You don't even know, do you?
I don't think that's it... Hang on a sec,\nare we assuming a person made this?
Maybe we're just overthinking, and it doesn't\nreally mean anything.
Me neither. It probably doesn't mean\nanything. No reason to overthink it.
But that doesn't change the fact that this\napp helped change Miyazawa's heart.
Yeah, Kiuchi's too. Thanks for that,\nMeta Nav.
Anyway, now we've gotta find the next Palace\nruler and change their heart ASAP!
That is correct. Let's start by listening to\nthe collective unconscious of this area.
Did you find the Palace?
It's not that. Something with a powerful\naura is coming this way!
It's an enemy! Be on your guard!
Huh!? What is that!?
This thing looks crazy strong!
Ah, I recognize this one too. But I was\nsure we defeated it back then.
I don't know what you're talkin' about,\nbut it's attacking!
What was that? It seemed different from a\nnormal Shadow.
Wonder and I have fought that Shadow before.
The day Wonder first entered Mementos,\nwe fought and defeated it.
Um... So a Shadow we thought was defeated\nreappeared again?
Yes, and it was even stronger than before...\nlike the power of its desire had grown.
What could this mean... Is this Shadow\nbeing constantly reborn here without end?
A Shadow of that strength, robbing people of\ntheir desires would mean...
No, it can't be. If that were the case, the\nworld would have already fallen into chaos.
I don't really get what all that means, but\nwhat kind of Shadow was it?
Sorry, I'm not sure either. But it's\nsomething we need to be wary of\ngoing forward.
Well, interruption aside, we should continue\nlooking for signs of the Palace.
Hm... No good. I can't hear anything about\nthe next Palace's ruler...
Does that mean the next Palace ruler is\nhiding their evil deeds like Miyazawa did?
Perhaps. Or it could be a villain who's yet\nto catch the public's attention.
Such people are hard to find by listening to\nthe voices from their Palace alone. We need\nmore intel.
How're we supposed to gather info in\nthe Metaverse?
Oh right, I guess we'll have to look for\nproblems going on in the real world and go\nfrom there.
Oh! Like how you guys investigated Miyazawa\nbefore I became a phantom thief.
Yes, well, I suggest we return to reality.\nI'm sure we're all exhausted from the battle.
Of course, you may continue searching, but\nI'll leave that decision up to our leader.
Watch it, moron! Ya coulda killed me!
Damn... What's that guy's problem!?
He was featured on Divine Justice.\nHe's a Menace.
I think he's called the "Hit-and-run Rider,"\nor something like that.
Hit-and-run Rider? Ugh, what a pain.
Agh, it's hard livin' in a world with so\nmany Menaces.
*chuckle* I am grateful for your presence\ntonight. Now first, a word of praise.
The strength of your desire has outdone the\nsinners of lust and vanity.
It may be presumptuous of me, but please\n accept this round of applause.
You, with desire powerful enough to guide\nsuch a world away from ruin...
It seems you are using the power bestowed\nupon you effectively.
My master refers to the power you use to\ninfiltrate other worlds.
Yes, the power granted to you... That of\nthe Metaverse Navigator.
It may become the key to averting the\ncoming catastrophe.
Or it may be the source that brings\ndestruction forth.
*chuckle* In other words...
You are not the only possessors of\nthis power.
Alas, we are merely observers of your\njourney. Therefore, we cannot give you\nthe answers.
Ultimately, the outcome must be chosen by\nyou and you alone.
Surely the action you take to uncover the\ntruth will bring your desire to new heights.
Sweet dreams... I look forward to our\nnext meeting.
Oh, you...! You're Shun's friend!
I'm thinkin' a startin' up shop again.\nJust takin' down the closed notice.
Haha, thanks.
Well, I can't say I'm back to a hundred\npercent yet.
But lately, even when I lie down to rest,\nall I can think about is my customers.
I just can't wait to see the smiles\non their faces when they eat my ramen.
I can sense Yamagoshi overflowing with hope.\nOf course this is a result of us changing\nMiyazawa's heart...
But unlocking the new area of Mementos\nmay have also had an effect.
So, if I can't sleep peacefully, I've just\ngotta open the shop back up, right?
Well, all my part-timers quit, so I'll still\nbe out of operation for a while, but...
Wait! You live around here, right?\nWant a job?
Oh, really?\nThanks, kid!
Well, come by again when ya feel like\nworkin'.
Sure. Ya don't gotta decide right away.\nJust think about it if you're interested.
Come by whenever ya feel like workin'\npart-time.
Ah boy, I'm gonna make ya late for school.
Looks like it might rain, so ya oughta\nhurry. See ya when I see ya.
It does look like rain...\nDo you have an umbrella?
Hm, I see. We don't have time\nto go back for one either, do we?
I suppose we'll just have to head to school\nand hope we arrive before the rain starts.
No umbrella for us then.
Oh! Morning!
Rain, huh...
It always rains the one time I don't bring\nan umbrella.
Riko-senpai!
Him too, of course.\nWe're all going to the same place, aren't we?
Sweet!
Thank you, Riko-senpai.\nYou're a lifesaver!
I just happened to be passing by.
I usually take the train, but today I had to\nfinish working on some documents\nbefore school.
Documents? I guess that would be hard on the\ntrain with the morning rush and all.
Yes. But I think I can finish the rest\nonce we arrive.
I've seen you at school, but this is\nthe first time we've really spoken.
You're in the same class as Motoha,\naren't you?
Ah, yes, that's right.
It's nice to meet you, {NAME1}-kun.\nMy name is Riko Tanemura.
Uh, what!?
Ummm... His name is {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nRiko-senpai.
Hehe, how interesting. It's nice to meet you.\nMy name is Riko Tanemura.
We're about to arrive. Check to make sure\nyou don't forget anything in the car.
Goodbye then.
Thank you so much, Senpai!
Lucky Riko-senpai picked us up!
Quite. We expected to get drenched,\nbut had a comfortable little journey instead.
And the vehicle itself was no less spacious\nnor less comfortable than my car form.
Hahaha, I think Senpai's car seats got yours\nbeat in the luxury department, Lufel.
Excuse me!?
Riko-senpai is super rich.\nShe's the daughter of Umetane's president.
Umetane?
Yeah, the company that sells umeboshi and\npickled goods. Their ads are on TV all the\ntime. You guys haven't heard of it?
They sell tons of plum products like juice\nand candy too.
Senpai always gave us that juice to drink\nafter practice.
Yeah, little league practice.
The baseball field we used to practice on\nbelongs to Umetane.
Yeah. You know how I used to play\nin little league?
The field we used to practice on\nwas Umetane's.
Riko-senpai and I are close in age,\nso she used to come cheer us on at games and\nwe became friends.
But it's been a long time since we've\nreally had a chance to talk.
Since starting high school, she's been busy\nwith disciplinary committee duties.
Huh? What's everyone gathering for?
Oh crap! Isn't there a school-wide assembly\nthis morning?
I remember your homeroom teacher saying\nsomething to that effect yesterday.
Crap! We're gonna stick out like sore thumbs\nif we get to the gym late!
We don't have time to stop by the classroom!\nLet's head straight to the gym!
The assembly's in the gym.\nCome on, we gotta hurry!
Next, please welcome the newest member\nof our school's teaching staff, Mr. Akashi.
NB[Di][771]
Hello, everyone! My name is Kei Akashi.\nI will be acting as an educational advisor\nin a temporary capacity.
I know this title may be a little difficult\nfor you to understand...
But essentially, I am an educational\nconsultant brought here to improve\nKokatsu Academy.
Educational consultant?
The heck kinda job is that?
My job is to look for ways to improve\nthis school and work with the school board\nto make those changes happen.
Your other teachers are so busy with their\nown responsibilities that I was brought in\nto work full-time on this effort.
So from tomorrow onward,\nyou may see me around the school,\nobserving classes and such...
But don't be alarmed. I promise it's all on\nthe up and up!
Then again, I suppose putting it that way\nmakes me seem more suspicious! Ahahaha!
Hehe, what a weirdo.
He seems easy to talk to.\nPlus he's kinda hot.
Make the vending machines free, Sensei!
Great idea! That being said, I'll have to\nnegotiate with the school board first.
But I'm open to all of your opinions!\nPlease feel free to get in touch with me!
Pfff, yeah sure. Like anything will actually\nchange anyway.
Whoa, for real?\nLet's go talk to him during lunch.
I guess Mr. Akashi must be the teacher\nTomoko was talking about.
I don't really get what an \nconsultant does, but he seems\nlike an interesting guy.
Well, if it stirs up hope in the students,\nthen all the better.
Thank you very much, Mr. Akashi.\nThat concludes the morning assembly.
Mr. Akashi,\nlet me introduce you to the disciplinary committee chair,\nRiko Tanemura-kun.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\nMr. Akashi.
Tanemura...\nAh yes, heiress to the Umetane company.
Those are different from the glasses\nyou were wearing before.\nAre those smart glasses?
Ah, yes.
My apologies.\nI uploaded all of the students' information into these\nin preparation for the job.
You are chair of the disciplinary committee,\ndaughter of a CEO, have excellent grades,\nand are very popular among your peers.
I'm nothing special...
Wow. That's Mr. Akashi for you.\nHis prep work is second to none!
I agree that Tanemura-kun is quite the\ntalent. She'll surely be a great help to you.
Feel free to get her to give you directions\naround the school or prepare any materials\nyou may need!
Sir... Isn't it a violation of compliance\nto order students around?
Oh! Um... You didn't hear that... Hahaha.
As for the private room you requested,\nplease use the Student Guidance Office.
Thank you very much.\nI know you've also prepared me a desk in\nthe Faculty Room, but...
Some of the documents I'll be working with\naren't meant to be seen by other teachers,\nso that will be a big help.
Of course. Please use the space freely!\nTanemura-kun, the documents?
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Akashi, these are the materials\nyou requested in advance. Please have a look.
Oho!
I've also prepared them in digital form,\nso I'll send the files to your computer.
Thank you very much! I'll be sure to use\nthat data to get the specifics I need.
But wow, it must have been quite the task\nto prepare all of this.
Hahaha, I told you, didn't I?\nTanemura-kun does outstanding work!
But, sir...
I know I'm the one who requested the\ndocuments, but this workload hardly seems\nreasonable for a single student.
Having students handle such sensitive\ndocuments is also an issue.
Ah\u2014 Uh\u2014 Haha...\nWell, she excels at keeping secrets too!
Unlike the other students, she understands\nwhat needs to be done and acts accordingly.
Is that right? You really shouldn't push her\ntoo hard, you know.
Wouldn't dream of it! But she will have to\ninherit her family's business someday...
...and this kind of clerical work\nwill prepare her for that.\nIsn't that right, Tanemura-kun!?
Yes. My father has encouraged me to help\nthe teachers with whatever they need.
I see...\nOutstanding indeed...
In that case, I may ask for your help\nafter school on occasion, so I look forward\nto working with you, Tanemura-san.
Of course, Mr. Akashi.
That's all the announcements for today.\nOh, one more thing.
Regarding Mr. Akashi from the assembly\nthis morning...
I know he mentioned he'll be around campus\nstarting tomorrow, and encouraged you all\nto come speak with him, but...
Well... Just be careful not to be rude\nto him, okay? That's all.
Does it seem like Ms. Katayama\nis acting strange?
Well, it certainly sounds like she has a bit\nof disdain for this Akashi fellow.
But he only just got here.\nYou think something happened between them?
And hang on, I still don't get\nwhat a consultant even does.
I'd hate to have more tests.\nBut I'd definitely welcome less!
He did say something about making learning\neasier at the assembly.
Oh, and some boys asked for\nfree vending machines too.
Oh yeah, I heard those boys at the assembly\nasking for free vending machines.
Oh, you don't? He said this morning that\nhe's open to requests from students...
Maybe we can ask for a fancier cafeteria menu?
Oh! And they should sell more baked goods!\nI'd looove some sweet pastries!
There's nothing wrong with having desires,\nbut an overactive appetite is another issue.
Hey! Headin' to lunch?
I found some interesting cup noodles\nat the convenience store this mornin'.\nWanna go to the hideout and try 'em?
They're really goin' all out on the flavors,\ndon't ya think? Gotta try everythin'\nat least once, right!?
All right! Let's grab some drinks and head\nto the roof.
Hey guys!\nWe're here with a taste testing video!
We're gonna buy every drink our school\nvending machine sells and try all of them! Yaaay!
What the hell?\nThey're blocking the vending machine.
Those two have been recording themselves\nover there for a while now.
Can't they tell they're in the way?\nSomebody should get a teacher.
Hey, don't you think this idea's\nkind of boring considering the cost?
Ugh, don't say that after we've started\nrecording. What's your idea then?
I got it. Let's do what that Menace on\nDivine Justice yesterday did.
You wanna imitate a Menace?\nHahaha, that's wild! Are you a Menace too!?
I'll use this spray and a lighter\nto make a flamethrower!
They're outta their minds!\nI gotta stop them!
What do you think you're doing!?
What's wrong with you!?\nThat frickin' hurt!
You took the words right out of my mouth.\nDo you have any idea how much danger you\nalmost put yourselves in just now?
Excuse me? We were just shooting a video.
And I got you on camera hitting a student!
Let's post about this violent teacher\non Divine Justice! I bet it'll go viral!
Hey, that's enough! Katayama-san\nwas just trying to stop you dumbasses\nfrom setting yourselves on fire!
Owww! What're you doing!?\nWho even are you?
A violent boy?\nHow dare you lay hands on a girl!?
What? Hey! Turn that camera off!
Kano-kun, calm down.\nLet go of her hand.
Oh, sorry...
Stop recording at once, you two.
Ah, hey! What the hell!? Give that back!
Hand over your phone too.
Hah? Are you covering this up\nbecause we caught you on camera?\nYou really are a Menace!
Violent teacher! Violent teacher over here!
That's enough alre\u2014!
Quiet, girls!
I heard some students were causing trouble.
What exactly is going on here?
Ms. Katayama assaulted me!
I got it all on video!
That's not what happened! You two started it\nwhen you whipped out a lighter!
Eep! Don't yell at me!
Please, just tell me what happened.
A dispute between a teacher and student?\nAs a consultant, I'd like to hear\nwhat's going on.
Mr. Akashi...
I will speak to Ms. Katayama.\nYou speak to the students, Tanemura-san.
Hold on. These students were engaged in\nincredibly dangerous behavior.
We can't just leave them be. If you're going\nto pull me aside, at least call for another\nteacher to deal with them.
No, the disciplinary committee chair\ncan handle it. Students should take care\nof other students.
Don't be ridiculous!\nIt's the teacher's job to guide the students!
I'm not being ridiculous. It's my job to\nuproot old ways of thinking like that.
Don't worry, Ms. Katayama. I'll be here to\nlisten to what the students have to say.
It's one of my jobs as chair of the\ndisciplinary committee.
Tanemura-san...
Return this to them.\nConfiscating personal effects is a big problem\nin today's climate.
They were recording other students! I can't\nreturn it until the videos are deleted!
What!? No way you're deleting our videos!\nScrew that!
If a teacher were to delete a video, there\nwould be allegations of a cover-up.
How about I, as a third party, check it?\nIf there truly is a problem,\nthen I'll delete it.
Huh!? How could you, Mr. Akashi!?
I'll only watch the one video.\nAlso, I don't recommend using controversy\nto go viral in this day and age.
When I have more time,\nI'll teach you how to make better videos.
Seriously? You know how to make videos?
Yes. I'm a consultant. I know exactly what\nkinds of videos will boost your numbers.
Whoa, Mr. Akashi's so chill!
Is that all then? You two, please follow me\nto the Student Guidance Office.
Does that mean that I'm gonna have to talk\nto Ms. Disciplinary Committee too?
Alright. I'll talk to Tanemura-san for you.\nEat your lunch before the break ends.
Okay, Ms. Katayama. With me, please.
All right...
Ms. Katayama! It wasn't your fault...\nWe saw everything!
Hey, you don't think Katayama-san's\nin the wrong, do you?
Right? Someone could've been seriously\nburned if she hadn't gotten involved.
And if she hadn't smacked the lighter\noutta that girl's hand, you better believe\nI woulda.
That's true... Maybe she coulda handled it\nbetter than she did...
But somebody could've been seriously burned\nif she hadn't gotten involved.
I understand your point, but it would have\nbeen an even bigger problem if you had\nattacked another student.
It wouldn't have come to that...!
I guess Katayama-san saved my ass\nonce again.
That's definitely Katayama, right?
I heard she hit some girl yesterday.
{NAME2}, look at this!
Ms. Katayama was posted as a Menace!
Look at this video!
Is this from yesterday's lunch break?\nIt looks quite heavily edited.
They blurred her face and wrote her name\nas Ms. K.
But any of the students here would\nimmediately know that it's Ms. Katayama.
Who would've posted something like this?
What is the meaning of this!?
A teacher, of all people, labeled a Menace!?\nThis is an unprecedented scandal!
And you, Mr. Akashi! I thought you had\nthe students delete the videos!
Yes, of course I did.\nHowever...
Other students may have been recording too.\nIt did cause quite a stir.
Agh! I've had it up to here!
Listen up, Ms. Katayama!\nNo contact with students outside of class\nfrom now on!
Don't touch them! Don't talk to them! Don't\ntake their things! Are we clear!?
Unbelievable... So you want me to just turn\na blind eye to dangerous behavior?
Call for Mr. Akashi or another teacher\nif that happens! Or get Tanemura-kun to help!
Tanemura-san!? Disciplinary committee aside,\nshe's just a student!
Are you suggesting teachers should rely\non students to do their jobs for them?
That student is more reliable than you are!
In fact, the female students Tanemura-san\n reprimanded both turned in formal letters\nof apology.
A far cry from the boy you sent back to class\nwithout a word of warning.
*sigh* At any rate,\nI want you to go home for the day.
What? But I have to teach my classes\nand conduct homeroom.\nI can't just abandon my duties.
Your classes will be study hall periods.\nAnd another teacher can sub in\nfor your homeroom.
You wouldn't be able to conduct classes\nanyway. You'd just get bombarded\nwith questions.
Okay... I understand.\nSorry to have caused such trouble.
Trouble? Try total nuisance!
This goes for the rest of you too!\nDon't interfere with students unnecessarily!
If something happens, turn to Mr. Akashi or\nTanemura-kun! Are we clear!?
Huh? What's Mr. Hakozaki doing here?
Where's Ms. Katayama?
Oh! Sorry to surprise everyone!\nMs. Katayama is um... Ummm...
Sick!\nShe wasn't feeling good and went home early!\nAnyway, I'll be filling in for her today!
Sick, huh? Yeah right!
Did she get fired since she was on\nDivine Justice?
She hasn't been f-f-fired!\nShe was just sent home is all...
Ahaha, Hakozaki-chan spilled the tea.
Gah! Um! It's time for announcements!\nI'm just gonna make them, and then we're done\nhere, okay?
I hope Ms. Katayama's okay.\nDo you think the other teachers are giving\nher trouble over what happened?
I still can't believe she was called out\non Divine Justice.
Whatever the circumstances, the fact\nthat video was posted to Divine Justice\nmeans...
...your homeroom teacher\nhas been declared a Menace.
No, no, no! She can't be declared a Menace\nfrom just one post!
Sure people are talking about it, but she\nhasn't been officially condemned by\nMagatsukami or anything...
But those reported on by Divine Justice\nare known as Menaces to the public.
It was the same with Kiuchi and Miyazawa...\nHasn't it always been that way?
Hey!\nDon't you dare lump her in with those two!
Of course there's a good chance this will\nget lost in the sea of other posts.
However, if she continues to be known\nas a Menace, the possibility of her\nbecoming a Palace ruler...
What? You agree with him, {NAME2}?
R-Right!? That would never happen!
As I said before, it's only a possibility.
I know you could be right,\nbut I really don't wanna believe it.
My head is killing me... I'm so pissed...
Why am I being called a Menace!?
Agh... Damn it all!\nWhy is this happening to me!?
I'm so pissed off!
Heheh...
Hey, {NAME2}!
Are you here buying lunch too?
Oh! Why don't we eat lunch together today?\nWe could go to the rooftop and...
Hey guys! Welcome to another taste testing\nvideo!
Uh, what's going on?
We're gonna buy every kind of bread in the\nstore and review them all!
Oh god, it's them again... They're the two\nthat had that fight with Ms. Katayama.
Hey! Get outta the way! Nobody else can\nbuy a damn thing!
Oh nooo, you're scaring me! Please stop\nyelling, okaaay?
Or I'll take a video of this and throw you\nunder the bus too! Gahaha!
What's wrong with those two!? I'm gonna\ngive them a piece of my mind!
Don't, Motoha! Those two are why\nMs. Katayama's getting the Menace treatment!
Seriously? All the more reason to call\nthem out!
Someone get Tanemura-senpai. Something has\nto be done about them.
Someone's already on it!
You haven't heard? Recently, everyone asks\nfor Riko-senpai when there's a dispute.
Because the teachers are unreliable...
Even when students are acting out, the\nteachers won't reprimand them.
If someone points a phone at them and says\nthey're recording, the teachers run off.
So what, they're having Tanemura-senpai do\ntheir jobs for them? That's ridiculous!
Over here, Tanemura-senpai! Over here!
You two again... Was that written apology\nyou submitted nothing but lies?
We didn't do anything. We're just here to\nbuy lunch.
You're inconveniencing the other students.\nCome over here for a moment.
Huh? Can't it wait until after we're\ndone recording?
You two shouldn't cause Tanemura-san any\nmore trouble.
Oh, hey, Mr. Akashi. Are you here to buy\nlunch too?
I came here to stop you. I warned you about\nsharing inflammatory videos, didn't I?
What's so inflammatory about food reviews?
All right, all right. I suppose I'll just\nhave to give you another lecture on\nviral videos, then.
For real? I guess we'll be having lunch with\nyou in the Student Guidance Office,\nMr. Akashi!
I'll deal with these two, so please take\na break.
Sorry to burden you.
It's not a burden at all. It's my job to\nmake school life better for all of\nthe students.
Let's go, you two.
Wow, Mr. Akashi handled that really well.\nGuess he's pretty reliable, huh?
Are you all right, Riko-senpai?
Oh, Motoha, Tomoko. And {NAME1}-kun too.
Did they interrupt your shopping as well?\nI'm sorry for the trouble.
Don't worry about us.
But, Riko-senpai, is it true that you're\nbeing called in to settle arguments?
Well... It's true that the committee has been\ncalled upon a lot more lately.
There you are, Tanemura-kun!
Was there another problem with students?\nI heard that Mr. Akashi took care of it\nfor you.
I appreciate you following up as well.\nHowever...
If you could avoid burdening him with your\nresponsibilities, we in the faculty would\nprobably have a higher opinion of you.
Instead of Riko-senpai, shouldn't the faculty\nbe dealing with these problems in the\nfirst place?
Oh... Uh, about that...
It's a work reform from Mr. Akashi. The idea\nis that students should manage\nother students.
It fosters student autonomy and frees up\ninstructors to focus on teaching.
The heck!? Sounds more like an excuse to\navoid responsibility!
Stop, Motoha.
Mr. Yamanashi, was there something you\nneeded my help with?
Oh, yes, yes there is. I'd like you to\ndigitize some more materials for me.
I forwarded you the email from Mr. Akashi.\nThe details are in there.
What the\u2014!? Did I seriously just see that\nman pawn off his work onto you!?
It's fine. If I just keep my head down and\ndo my job, Mr. Yamanashi will have a higher\nopinion of me.
He's simple and easy to deal with. He'll do\nanything to make life easier for himself.
If you make someone like him think you're a\nuseful pawn, he won't turn on you.
Turn on you...?
In that respect, maybe we can trust\nMr. Akashi too. Even though he's shadier than\nthose glasses and just as hard to read.
He's not the type to abandon someone unless\nthey're getting in his way.
What are you talking about, Riko-senpai?\nAbandonment, betrayal...
No one would do something like that to you!
I wonder...
Don't you feel uneasy when relationships are\nbased solely on feelings or friendship?
Personally, I don't trust people who try to\nget close to me without knowing what they\nstand to gain from it.
Really? But...
I like you, Senpai! Even if there's nothing\nin it for me!
Yeah! I like you too, Riko-senpai!
I know! I can help with the work\nMr. Yamanashi gave you!
And just because I want to help you! I don't\nwant anything in return!
Motoha, Tomoko... You two never change, huh?
Thank you, but I don't need any help. I can\nmanage on my own.
You came to buy lunch, didn't you? Hurry up\nbefore they run out.
Riko-senpai...
Does she seem different? She never used to\nsay stuff like that before.
Yeah... What happened to her?
What are we doing today? Going to\nthe Metaverse?
We still haven't found the next Palace.
With Miyazawa, you said you found him by\nlistening for his full name, right?
Yes. It's easier to find Palace rulers\nthrough the collective unconscious if I know\ntheir full names.
But there aren't many people causing an\nuproar in the real world on the same level\nas Kiuchi and Miyazawa.
We should consider changing our\napproach, then.
Think of what Kiuchi and Miyazawa had in\ncommon. They were both Menaces.
And they were officially condemned by\nMagatsukami. Kiuchi as the Subway Slammer, and\nMiyazawa a corrupt food critic.
Well, I guess since Palaces pop up around\nbad guys, assuming the next ruler could be\nanother Menace isn't much of a reach.
Does that mean one of the Menaces trending\non Divine Justice right now could be our guy?
Hmmm... A reckless cyclist known as the\nHit-and-run Rider. No one knows their\nname or face.
And then there's Ms. K, the violent teacher\nof K Academy...
Let's skip that one! Who else...
No, we can't take her off the suspect list\nyet. Katayama is a Menace.
Hah!?
What're you talkin' about, Lufel!?\nKatayama-san's only up there because of\nthose selfish dumbasses!
That may be the case, but I'm simply stating\nthe facts of the matter.
Katayama appeared on Divine Judgment and\nbecame known to the public as a Menace.
Fine, maybe that happened, but still...!
You mentioned that the other day, too,\nLufel.
Well, I guess she is being treated like\na Menace.
But that doesn't mean she has a Palace,\nright? She's not like those other two!
Ah! Wait, Shun. Someone's coming.
Ms. Katayama!?
Kano-kun, can I speak with you?\nYou two as well.
It's about this video.
Miyazawa's Food Fight announcement?
What!? I thought he deleted the channel.\nAll his videos should be gone.
He was a famous streamer, so it got reposted\nall over the place.
I talked about it with {NAME1}-kun and Arai-san\nbefore, but I didn't check with you\nyet, Kano-kun.
The boy named as the opponent... His face\nis hidden, but it's you, isn't it, Kano-kun?
Uh, no! That's um\u2014 That's not...!
That day, all three of you skipped afternoon\nclasses and came back to school together.
You paid Hiromu Miyazawa a visit, didn't you?
The hell\u2014!? {NAME2}! Shhh!
Thank you for answering honestly.
Burgers? Likely story.
Don't worry, you're not in trouble. And I\nwon't tell the other teachers.
Miyazawa's retirement caused a real stir\nsince he was a fairly powerful celebrity up\ntill then.
And if you were involved in a dispute with\nsomeone like that, well, I wish you would\nhave come to me for help.
Because as an adult... Or really, as your\nteacher, I want to help you all in\nany way I can.
Ms. Katayama...
You three are together a lot lately. If\nthat's just because you're friends and all,\nthat's great, but...
I'm worried that you might still have some\nproblem you're dealing with.
How did you\u2014
Ah, uh, nope! We're uhhh, all good!\nRight as rain!
You're a terrible liar, Kano-kun. Hehe.\nYour face says it all.
If you're in trouble, I want you to talk to\nme. Don't do anything dangerous on your own.
I'm sorry! This is something we just...\ncan't tell you!
It's not that there isn't a problem, but...\nI just don't wanna get you involved...
Why not?
I can't tell you that either.
But... We're totally fine! We'll get through\nthis one way or another!
Yeah, there's no need for you to worry\nyourself sick over us!
Am I really that unreliable...?
Hm...
Ms. Katayamaaa?
This is no good. The academic coordinator\nalready told you, fraternizing with students\noutside of class is prohibited.
What do you mean prohibited?
Right now you're persona non grata. We can't\nhave you making the students uneasy.
It's okay, Kano-kun.
Please forgive me. I'll return to the\nfaculty office at once.
When the three of you are really\nstruggling...
Please ask an adult for help. Even if it's\nsomeone other than me.
That's all I wanted to say. Anyway...\nExcuse me.
That must have been quite trying for you all.
Ms. Katayama was worried about us and\ncame to give us some advice.
Oh? If you need advice, maybe I can help.\nI am an educational consultant after all.
{NAME1}-kun and Arai-san from 2C, and\nKano-kun from 2D.
How do you know our names?
Neat, isn't it? These smart glasses allow me\nto match faces against the student register.
Anyways, I'm always open to listening to\nproblems or taking suggestions for school\nimprovements.
I thought he was a good teacher at first,\nbut Mr. Akashi's kinda creepy, huh?
Can't say I've ever been a fan.
Thank goodness. We can finally resume our\nstrategic meeting. So, as I was saying...
I think I'd like to try searching for a\nPalace with the name Kumi Katayama.
What!? Would you drop it already!?
No need for such ire. We could end up proving\nthat she has no Palace.
We'll simply try each name we can think of\nand eliminate suspects one by one. That's our\nonly option at the moment.
Tch. Seems like a waste of time to me. But\nif it'll lift your suspicion, then whatever\nfloats your boat, Lufel.
Then it's settled. Let's go to the Metaverse\nas soon as we can, Leader.
Kumi... Katayama...
I still don't think you're gonna\nfind anything.
That's exactly why we came here to\nmake sure, Soy.
Sure, but still...
...Found it.
I've detected a Palace with the name\nKumi Katayama. There's no doubt about it.
No way! You're wrong!
Is Ms. Katayama really a Palace ruler?
No freakin' way! Are you sure it's not\nsomeone else, Cattle!?
No, the name Kumi Katayama is definitely\ncausing voices in Mementos to react.
But there's something strange about them.\nIt's like there's noise making the voices\njumbled up.
Miyazawa's Palace was nothing like this.
Are you kidding me? How could this happen...?
Yeah... Now that we found the place, we have\nto check it out.
Sorry, Cattle, but I won't believe this till\nI see it with my own two eyes.
Let's go, Wonder!
We need to pinpoint the location of the next\nPalace before I lose the trail.
Whoa, is this...?
Yes. Just like with Kiuchi and Miyazawa,\nthis Palace exists outside of Mementos.
Is this Palace really Ms. Katayama's?
We won't know without a proper investigation.\nLet's go, Wonder.
So this is... Katayama-san's Palace?
What kind of facility is this? Pretty sure\nit's not a school.
It looks like there's some kind of large\nstructure in the distance.
But that barricade is blocking our path.
Let's find another way in, Wonder.
Hoo... Do you hear water?
Yeah, I do... It's like the sound of a river\nor a waterfall, right?
What the hell is this place?
It seems we can still go further into the\nbuilding. Let's have a look.
Whoa!
Oh damn! It's a dam!
But why a dam? Is this a memorable place for\nher or something?
We may learn why in the course of\ninvestigation.
Perhaps we can enter from over there?\nLet's go, Wonder.
Hmm?
This door won't open.
Maybe it's locked?
Oh hey, look at that!
Is this a keypad lock?
So it won't open without the right\npasscode...
God damn it. Okay, what should we try?
A number, huh? I didn't see anything on the\nway in that seemed like a clue.
But this door looks like the only way ahead.
Well it's Ms. Katayama's Palace, so the\nnumbers should have something to do\nwith her, right?
Soy, do you happen to know her birthday?
Nah, how would I know that?
Ugh! What're you talkin' about!?\nKatayama-san's just... She looks out\nfor me is all!
Then why are you blushing?
Shut it! Wait, you can't even see my face\nthrough this mask!
Come now. Enough nonsense. This is\nenemy territory.
Good point... So, Soy, can you think of a\nnumber that might fit the bill?
Hmmm, maybe it's some kind of mnemonic?
Oh, that's brilliant! But I doubt it's a\ntwo-digit passcode.
Maybe we gotta replace the letters of her\nname with numbers and add them to get... 54?
K, U, M, I, 11 + 21 + 13 + 9... That makes\n54, but I doubt it's a two-digit passcode.
Maybe it's 23 because she's the homeroom\nteacher of 2C?
Well, if we combine them...
Well, that didn't work...
In that case, should we just try everythin'\nstarting from 0000?
Well, we don't actually know if it's a\nfour-digit number either.
Huh? What was that!?
Wha\u2014!? An enemy!? Damn! I can't believe\nI didn't notice it approaching!
Who might you be? This area is limited to\nauthorized personnel only.
Who's this chump? Don't tell me he's the\nPalace ruler?
No, his aura is too weak. No wonder I\ncouldn't sense him.
In fact, his presence is even weaker than\nthat of the wandering Shadows in Mementos.
Then he's weaker than a normal Shadow?\nGeez, I panicked over nothing.
In that case, let's roast this small fry and\nkeep movin'.
Small fry!? Excuse you!
Verbal abuse against someone you've just\nmet is a violation of compliance.
But I'll admit, I detest violence myself.\nSuch dirty business is best delegated.
However, this dam is still undergoing\nconsultation and lacks the proper security.
Ah well, nothing for it. I'll just have to\ntake out these fools myself.
Mwahahaha... I feel so alive...!
What's with this guy!?
Stay vigilant! I can sense his power\ngrowing by the second!
He's attacking!
All right! It's working! Let's keep it up!
You're going to regret underestimating me!
It looks like I have some waste to\ndispose of!
I'm really no good with violence.\nHow's this?
Ahhh, I feel like a new man.
What the\u2014!? Did he just heal himself!?
Yes. It seems the energy in his armor has\nrestorative properties.
Still, it's likely finite. A steady offense\nshould eventually wear him down.
My, what tenacious little fools. I suppose\nI'll have to spare no effort.
I'm not quite sated, but I've gotten enough\nof a taste. Your attacks are powerless\nagainst me now.
Huh? "Taste"!? A taste of what!?
He's analyzed our attacks and made himself\nimmune to them. What a nuisance. We'll need\nto act carefully.
*chuckle* Time to turn it up a notch.\nThis next one may shock you.
Now for your free consultation. This will\nhurt quite a bit.
I thought we were in trouble at first, but\nwe got him on the ropes!
Excuuuse me?
Ahhh... This is exactly why I can't stand\nlittle fools who know nothing but violence.
But I can use fools... They don't understand\nthe hierarchy at play.
Hmph... You leave me no choice. So your\nfeeble brains can comprehend...
It's time I give you a thorough consulting!
Is it\u2014!?
It healed all of the damage we've dealt\nso far!
You're kidding! So our attacks were all\nfor nothing?
Yes. And if we keep battling like this, it's\npossible it'll just keep recovering!
Continuing to fight isn't a good idea!\nWonder, give us your orders!
Understood!
They're gone... Fools are quick to turn tail\nand run.
Seems it left.
*sigh* Thank god.
That Shadow healed itself completely.\nIs it invincible?
There was that cable thing it stuck into\nthe ground.
Maybe that gave it a power boost or helped\nit recover or something?
It did seem that way. Almost as if it\nabsorbed the energy of the Palace through\nthat cable.
Hoom... It may have to do with the Palace\nbeing shaped like a dam.
You mean it's sapping electricity made by\nthe dam and using it to power itself?
Wait, isn't that cheating!? We could hammer\naway at that thing for years and it wouldn't\ntake a scratch!
This is a cognitive stronghold of the\nruler's own design. Unfairness is to\nbe expected.
But, this is Katayama's Palace, isn't it?\nWhat's a thing like that doing here in\nthe first place?
I have no idea. I've never seen anything\nlike this before. Anyway...
Even if we manage to get past the Shadow,\nthere's still the number lock to\ncontend with.
Let's head back to reality and plan our next\ncourse of action.
We should retreat for now. Let's return\nto reality, Wonder.
Phew! Glad we made it back safely.
That weird Shadow from earlier... Was that\nsupposed to be Ms. Katayama's Shadow?
No way in hell! That disgusting creep\ncouldn't possibly be her!
Shadows exist in conjunction with their\nreal-life counterparts. They manifest the\ndesires of their other self.
Depending on how the person perceives\nthemself, their Shadow can appear vastly\ndifferent than how they look in reality.
Okay sure, but there's a limit. Didn't that\nthing have a man's voice?
It did. And it was so far removed from my\nimage of Ms. Katayama, it was almost like...
Or I guess, it really was like the Shadow\nreminded me of a different person entirely.
Now that you mention it, it DID sound like\nMr. Akashi! Tone and everything!
Oh yeah. It said something about "consulting"\ntoo, didn't it?
Consulting...?
Oh, that's it! The voice sounded just like\nMr. Akashi's!
Oh yeah. Had the same pretentious lilt to\nit too.
So that Palace wasn't Ms. Katayama's...\nIt was Mr. Akashi's?
Yes, that must be it! I knew Ms. Katayama\ncouldn't be a Palace ruler!
But I found the Palace from the name of\n"Kumi Katayama."
There's no doubt that the palace was created\nby Katayama.
No way! Why the hell would Akashi's Shadow\nbe in there, then!?
It's possible that Kumi Katayama's mind\nconstructed him as well. Like a sort of\n"cognitive being."
A cognitive being... of Mr. Akashi?
Essentially, the version of Akashi that\nKatayama imagines in her heart.
Uh-huuuh... So you're saying the Mr. Akashi\nin her heart protects the Palace?
I really can't see him being her knight in\nshining armor though.
Yeah. If anything, it's the total opposite.
Well, to summarize, if that's Akashi's\ncognitive being...
We may be able to overcome its invincibility\nif we learn more about the relationship\nbetween them.
Right. Let's investigate what's going on\nwith them!
Sounds like a plan. Maybe that'll help us\nfind out why Katayama-san ended up with a\nPalace in the first place, too.
I think we've done enough for one day.\nWe should head home and get some rest.
Hoo! Finally, the sweet taste of stewed eggs\nand roast pork! *shlurp*
Listen up, {NAME2}! You better bring me\nwith you tonight! Don't forget!
Thanks for comin', Shun! And same to\nyou, Motoha-chan, {NAME2}-kun.
We're happy to see you're feeling better,\nYamagoshi-san!
You guys have helped us out so much, today's\nmeal is our treat!
Pops and I are cookin' up each of our\nspecial ramens, so get ready to eat at least\ntwo bowls!
All right! I was born ready!
Not a problem. Your smiles are the only\nthanks we need.
Don't you worry! I'll eat whatever you\ncan't finish!
That's more worrying...
Unfazed, huh? Well, that's reassuring\nat least!
Let me help you out.
I'm fine! Sit, sit!
I can't believe ya haven't come by once\nsince the reopenin'. Some apprentice!\nYa break an ol' man's heart.
But\u2014! I only found out today! I woulda\ncome the second I knew!
Haha. By the way, {NAME2}-kun, is it\nreally okay to give roast pork to an owl?
You got it! Stewed egg and roast pork for\nthe pet owl comin' right up!
Haha, it's no problem at all. Ya have the\nplace to yourselves today.
I'll also throw in some stewed eggs with\nthe pork. Hope you're hungry, pet owl-kun!
Pet!?
Mmm! This is amazing! My mouth's exploding\nwith bonito goodness!
Haha, right!? That's Pops's patented flavor.
Hooaaah!
This is life-changing! How dare you three\nkeep this flavor all to yourselves!? The\nnerve...
Like we had a choice? You can't bring an owl\ninto a restaurant. We had to book the place\nout just so you could try the food.
Anyway, should you be talking right now? Pops\nand Masa-san would freak out if they heard\nyou.
You don't have to worry about that. Regular\npeople can't hear my voice.
Only people with strong potential for desire,\nwho can use the Metaverse Navigator, are able\nto understand me.
Yamagoshi and Masa have desires, but not the\nstrength of heart that you all possess.
I don't really get it, but I guess that's\njust how it is...
Shun, what're you muttering to yourself\nabout?
Ahhh, I think I died and went to heaven.
Haha, think you have room for seconds? I was\njust about to start cooking my ramen.
Yes, please! Of course I do!
Too loud and too fast!
This is great. Seein' you all eat your fill\nmakes me so happy.
That reminds me, you two are in Kumi-chan's\nclass, aren't ya?
Kumi-chan? Oh, you mean Ms. Katayama! Do you\ntwo know each other?
Whoops. Did I forget to mention that? Pops\nand Masa-san were hopin' to ask about her\ntoday.
Ms. Katayama and Masa-san were both regulars\nhere since they were students, right?
That's right. Kumi-chan came by a lot when\nshe was around your age.
But they were both such wild kids back then,\nyou'd hardly recognize 'em.
Well, umm... Let's just call that the\nrashness of youth. Sorry about all that.
What!? Wild? Do you mean you were like,\ndelinquents...?
Yup. You could say they're both reformed\ndelinquents.
Ms. Katayama's an ex-delinquent!?
Right!? It's really hard to believe seeing\nhow she is now.
Um, hello!?
You do know we're in the middle of talking\nabout Katayama-san now, right?
Hang on, I can't imagine the teacher we know\nnow as a delinquent!
She was famous back then, you know. Lightning\nLegs Katayama, they called her.
Lightning Legs!?
That's the first I heard a this. What's it\nmean?
Back then there were four big gang leaders\nin the city.
Kumi-chan was one of 'em, and they were all\nfightin' for control over the rest.
Whoa! That's like something out of a manga!
One time, a student was attacked near Arakawa\nRiver, so she rode her bike all the way there\nto serve up some justice.
This other time, she took down a whole gang\nof delinquents from another school with just\na left kick.
Just a kick? So that's why she's Lightning\nLegs! That's so awesome!
Ah, well that's part of it, but she was\nreally known for pedaling her bike crazy\nfast.
When the gang went out on our motorcycles at\nnight, she'd put a light on her bicycle an\npedal after us till she caught up.
Ah, that's why she's Lightning Legs...
Uh... When you put it like that it sounds\npretty cringey...
Kumi-chan's parents didn't get along, so she\ndidn't really have a safe place to call home.
She'd go ridin' her bike all over the place\ntryin' to forget about her troubles.
She'd always stop by on her way home for a\nbowl a ramen sayin', "I rode to the dam\ntoday!"
The dam!?
Ya musta noticed she's got a bit of a short\nfuse. Back then it got 'er mixed up in all\nkinds a fights with other delinquents.
But her homeroom teacher in second year was\nreal sympathetic to 'er.
So she quit all a that and started studyin'\nhard to be a teacher.
'Round the same time, Masa turned over a new\nleaf and started studyin' ramen.
Wow!
Here you go! Hope you enjoy the ramen that\ncame about from all that!
I'll bring over Shun's bowl and some roasted\npork for the owl right away!
Oh, I'll get them!
Thanks for the meal!
Thank you so much! That was seriously\ndelicious!
'Course! Get home safe, ya hear? And come by\nagain sometime.
Come by Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku too!
Yes! Of course we will!
Wait, is that it? I was hoping to ask more\nabout Katayama and Akashi.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Um, Yamagoshi-san, Masa-san, you've known\nMs. Katayama for a long time...
Do you know a man named Akashi? Kei Akashi.
Akashi? Never heard of him.
I never heard of him either. Why do you ask?
Oh, no reason! I was just wondering.
Anyway, thanks again for the feast today!
Wooow. Call me a turkey, 'cause I'm stuffed!\nThat was... the greatest few hours of my\nlife.
And I finally got to savor that scrumptious\npork and stewed eggs. The flavor was just...\nso... exquisite.
But the only way I can enjoy that sublime\ndish again is to rent out the entire\nrestaurant...?
I'll make it for you if you want. Mine's\nnowhere near as good as Pops's though.
Oh! I'll hold you to that, Shun! In fact, you\ncan make it every day if you want!
Still.... I was shocked to hear about\nMs. Katayama's past. Did you know any of\nthat, Shun?
I'd heard a bit about it from Masa-san. The\nLightning Legs thing was news to me though.
Yeah, I can't believe she could cycle all the\nway to the dam!
Ah... Maybe that's why her Palace is a dam?
Could be.
And yet, neither of them seem to have any\nrecollection of Akashi's name.
Yeah. They must be connected somehow, but\nseems like they weren't fellow delinquents.
It seems that Palace must be Katayama's after\nall.
Well, anyhoo, we should continue\ninvestigating the relationship between the\ntwo of them.
Hey there.
What's that?
A gift. Don't you ever feel like drinking\nplum juice when you're tired?
Ah, but you're probably tired of drinking\nthe same stuff you have at home...
No, not at all. Thank you for buying it for\nme.
However, as a disciplinary committee member,\nI cannot accept favors from teachers.
As serious as ever.
You should say no to the academic coordinator\ntoo. Don't just accept whatever he tells you\nto do.
I don't mind the work.
Really? What kind of work is he...
Why is he having you compile this kind of\ndata? It has nothing to do with the students.
Mr. Yamanashi and computers don't mix.
I like helping teachers with things I'm good\nat.
Do you really mean that? Because it looks\nlike you're pushing yourself too hard to me.
I thought maybe you were sacrificing yourself\nto play the model student everyone expects\nyou to be.
Ever since back then...
Even if that were true, where's the problem?
I am fulfilling the role that's expected of\nme. Why should I have to feel guilty about\nthat?
Because students... Children, should be\nallowed to live their lives freely!
This is the time for you to discover what you\nlike and think about what you want for your\nlife.
Us adults are supposed to support that! Not\ncrush children's hopes!
What I want is to prove myself useful to the\nfaculty.
Why are you so concerned with what I'm doing?\nDoes me staying busy trouble you in some way?
Well... I've been worried about you for a\nlong time now...
Am I getting preferential treatment because\nI'm supposed to inherit Umetane?
I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
But you're no longer my homeroom teacher,\nso you don't need to worry about me anymore.
All right, all right. That's enough. Pack it\nin, Ms. Katayama.
Mr. Akashi...?
Contact with students outside of class is\nstrictly prohibited. How many times must you\nbe told?
That must have been scary. Are you all right,\nTanemura-san?
I'm completely fine... What are you doing\nhere, Mr. Akashi?
You've been doing the work I asked the\nacademic coordinator to complete, correct?
I remembered that, so I was on my way here to\ncheck when I heard Ms. Katayama yelling.
Yelling!?
Thank goodness I made it in time before she\ngot violent with another student.
Violent!? I'd never do anything of the sort!
Oh look, there's that temper of yours again.
Ms. Katayamaaa, students are not children.\nThey are individuals.
Scolding them and suppressing their autonomy\nis a thing of the past. We must all respect each\nother as independent people.
Those kinds of boundaries are crucial. But\nyou don't seem to realize, what you're doing\nis just...
...self-gratification, isn't it?
Me!? You're the assholes using her for your\nown gain!
You call these reforms!? Why are you leaving\nstudents to fend for themselves!?
The teachers are taking it easy and putting\nall the burden on her! How is that\neducation!?
Tanemura-san is already struggling with her\nresponsibilities to her family!
Don't make her bear such a heavy burden\nanymore! Stop making her suffer!
Sensei...?
What do you think you're doing,\nMs. Katayama!?
Are you okay, Mr. Akashi? I'm glad I noticed\nyour message.
This is a clear act of violence,\nMs. Katayama! What on earth do you think\nyou're doing!?
N-No, it's not... I...
Whoa, she really is a violent teacher! I got\nthe best part on camera!
You!? You recorded that!?
I mean, we were just waiting out here for\nMr. Akashi to come back foreeever.
He promised he'd help us more with our\nvideos.
Give me that phone! Delete the video!
Whoa, yikes! Definitely not doing that!
Enough! Mr. Akashi, please deal with these\nkids! And you, Ms. Katayama...!
I'll hear what you have to say for yourself\nin the faculty offi\u2014 No, the reception\noffice!
Okay...
There's no use in denying it. I recorded the\nwhole thing as well.
Tanemura-kun... Go home for today! And tell\nno one about this! Got it!?
He recorded the whole thing?
Mr. Akashi has been wearing his smart glasses\nall day for some reason.
Was he already recording when he entered\nthe room?
And the timing of the academic coordinator\nand those two girls showing up to meet\nMr. Akashi was too convenient...
So that means...
Oh, {NAME1}! This is bad!
Katayama-san is\u2014!?
It says the reason was "violent behavior on\nschool property." But she would never\u2014
I heard she grabbed Mr. Akashi by the collar\nand threatened him. She's totally off the\ndeep end.
Huh? Poor Mr. Akashi... Katayama really is a\nMenace. She's lost it.
Katayama-san wouldn't hurt a fly!
W-What are you talking about!? If she didn't\ndo anything, this wouldn't be happening,\nwould it?
Only a matter of time till she's condemned\nnow. Should we post a pic of the notice to\nDivine Justice?
Don't you dare!
Quiet, everyone.
First period is about to start. Report to\nyour classrooms at once.
Tanemura-senpai, is it true you were there\nwhen it went down?
Where did you hear that?
Whoa, it's true! Set this guy straight then.\nTell him she's a violent Menace of a teacher.
She was suspended for being a Menace, right?
Enough wild speculating.
The other teachers are handling\nMs. Katayama's load while she's serving her\nsuspension.
So there's no point in us making a fuss over\nit. Now get to class before you're all late.
Ugh, you're no fun!
And I was sure the disciplinary committee\nchair would tear Katayama to shreds...
Um, Riko-senpai... Is it true that you saw\nwhat happened?
You're going to be late too. Head to class.
That rumor spread quickly. Maybe too\nquickly...
I can't believe Ms. Katayama's suspended\nindefinitely...
Rumor has it Ms. Katayama and Riko had an\nargument in the Student Guidance Office. When\nMr. Akashi rushed to the scene...
Ms. Katayama attacked him, which the\nacademic coordinator and a number of other\nstudents witnessed.
Why would Ms. Katayama do something like\nthat?
And to Akashi of all people... It's just like\nin the Metaverse.
Would things have gone differently if we'd\nbeen able to take down the Palace?
If we'd defeated that Akashi-lookin'\nShadow... Could we have prevented this?
I understand your point, but let's think\nrationally for a moment.
That being is probably not Akashi's Shadow.\nI hypothesize that it may be a cognitive form\nborn from Katayama's mind.
If we had defeated it, Katayama's feelings\ntoward Akashi in real life may have changed,\nbut...
So if we'd defeated it, Ms. Katayama might\nnot have used violence against Mr. Akashi?
But isn't it weird? Why was he the one\nprotecting Ms. Katayama's Palace?
I don't get why someone she hates enough to\nthrow hands with would be the symbol that\nprotects her heart.
Neither do I.
But if Akashi's showin' up in her Palace,\nhe must be a big deal to Katayama-san in some\nrespect.
In any case, let's investigate Akashi. We\nknow for a fact he's connected to the Palace.
Yeah. But how are we gonna do that? Should we\ntry asking the other teachers?
Asking them what?
R-Riko-senpai!?
I'm sorry, I didn't intend to eavesdrop,\nbut I just want to confirm...
Were you talking about investigating\nMr. Akashi?
Who can say, right? What were we talking\nabout again...? *whistling*
You're awful at whistling.
We were just talkin' about how worried we are\nabout Ms. Katayama...
What a coincidence. I was also thinking of\ninvestigating Mr. Akashi.
Would you like to work together on this?
Well... I can't say any more about it here\nat school.
Hey now! First you eavesdrop, now you're\ntellin' us to help you without givin' a\nreason?
Shun! Don't be rude!
We need to know.
You were there when it happened, right?
Ms. Disciplinary Committee was right there on\nthe scene, but didn't do anything to stop\nher?
You're right. I am somewhat at fault for not\nstopping her.
But I want to investigate Mr. Akashi to find\nout why this situation occurred in the first\nplace.
I need time to explain, so perhaps we could\nmeet somewhere off campus?
Thank you. I'll message you with the details\nthen, Motoha.
Uh, sure! Sounds good!
She feels guilty about it, huh? Maybe we can\ntrust her then.
That's the spirit, Shun.
But to think that someone was eavesdropping\non us. Some hideout this is.
Ahaha... We'll have to keep a closer eye on\nour surroundings next time.
But Riko-senpai... I wonder where all this isn\ncoming from.
I got a message from Riko-senpai. She wants\nto know if we can meet after school.
She said she has some errands to run first,\nso she wants us to meet her in Kichijoji\ntonight.
Okay. Shun's good to go too.
Oh, hey! You're here!
That's all of us. Let's get to Kichijoji.
My map is showing a lot of\nimported food vendors ahead...
What's goin' on over there?\nLooks like they're filmin' somethin'.
Huh? Isn't that Riko Tanemura\nin front of the camera over there?
Umetane's umeboshi will be sold at Kichijoji\nStation until the end of the week.
Please stop by if you happen to be\nin the area.
All right! That's a wrap!
Thank you very much.
You look absolutely adorable, Riko-senpai!\nIs this for TV!?
Oh, I'm sorry.\nIt's already the time that we agreed to meet,\nisn't it?
I'll be finished soon.\nWould you mind waiting a little?
Was that an interview?\nWow! It's like you're a celebrity\nor something!
Is Ms. Disciplinary Committee moonlighting\nas a model?
No, I'm simply helping the family business.\n That was an ad for our shop.
It will only make a brief appearance\non the evening news.
Family business? What kind of business?
Oh, you don't know, Shun?\nHer father's the president of Umetane.
Umetane!?
As in Umetane umeboshi and pickles!?\nThe ones in all those commercials on TV!?
Nah. I knew she was some kinda heiress,\nbut I had no idea it was to Umetane.
I'm a huge fan of your umeboshi!
Oh, so you're a regular of ours?\nThank you so much for your patronage.
It's pretty funny watching Shun turn\non a dime like that.
Lay off! It's a secret ingredient in my\nbroth. Their stuff is super high quality.
'Course it is. They make the best umeboshi\nout there!
I use it as a secret ingredient in my broth,\nso you could say I owe a lot to Umetane.
No prob.
By the way, your outfit is really cute,\nRiko-senpai. It looks amazing on you!
You think so? Thank you.
Hehe, thank you. I appreciate that,\neven if it's just flattery.
Wha\u2014!? How can you say that, {NAME2}!?
It looks amazing! She's beautiful!\n"Anyone could pull it off." What are you even saying?
Hehe, thanks, Motoha.\nBut I think he might be right.
Anyway, I can't go to the caf\xe9 dressed like\nthis, can I?
Please go ahead and wait for me there.\nI'll come meet you as soon as\nI've finished changing.
Sorry to keep you all waiting\nafter inviting you out.
No, it's no problem at all!\nBut when will you be on TV!?\nI'll be sure to watch!
Hehe, the umeboshi is the star of the show,\nso I doubt you will see all that much of me.
Anyway, back to the topic at hand...
You wanna look into Akashi, right?
You did actually see it go down, right?\nDid Katayama really attack him?
I guess that's a good place to start from.\nI'll tell you everything I saw.
It sounds like Mr. Akashi was purposely\ntrying to provoke Ms. Katayama.
The two students who gave her trouble before\n just happened to be there to witness it?\nWay too convenient, if you ask me.
Well, since you're only hearing my side\nof the story it may be a little\nsubjective, but...
It seems like you've all come to the same\nconclusion I did. There are too many\nof these "coincidences" to overlook.
First of all, Ms. Katayama was told\nnot to make contact with students\noutside of class.
Oh, now that you mention it, Mr. Akashi\ndid say something like that to her.
But it seems that Ms. Katayama continued\nreaching out to students she was\nconcerned about.
Well, when she's worried about her students,\nshe can't just throw 'em to the lions.\nShe's not that kinda person.
You're right.\nBut what if someone\ndecided to use that against her?
Yes, that's right.
Mr. Akashi's been following Ms. Katayama\nand interfering at every turn. It's been a\nsource of frustration for her.
Apparently it's been happening frequently...\nYou witnessed a similar incident yourself,\ndidn't you, Kano-kun?
Yeah... Akashi interrupted us when we were\ntalking to Katayama-san on the roof.
Oh yeah! I remember that!\nI was wondering what he was doing there!
And now that she's being treated like a\nMenace, Ms. Katayama seems to be in an\nemotionally vulnerable state.
Then there's her sense of responsibility\nto the students. Not being allowed to interact\nwith them is making matters worse.
She could explode at any time.\nThat's the state she was in when she came to talk\nto me that day.
And you're saying Akashi,\nknowing all of that...
Yes. He confronted her after having arranged\nfor the academic coordinator and those two\ngirls to witness everything.
Maybe it sounds too contrived to believe.
Well... Now that you mention it...
I have another reason to doubt Mr. Akashi.\nHis smart glasses.
His what? Oh, you mean those lame\nspecs he wears?
Yes. I think Mr. Akashi was recording\nfrom the second he entered the room.
He was convinced he could make Ms. Katayama\nturn violent on him, so...
It's still too early to say.
It may just be speculation on my part,\nbut I believe there's good reason to be\nsuspicious of him.
I did a little research on Mr. Akashi.\nIt seems he used to work as a\nbusiness consultant.
With his help, all of his client companies\nimproved and achieved great success.
Most comments about him online praise his\nskill as a consultant...
But I found some more interesting posts\non anonymous message boards.
This...
"After I disagreed with his methods,\nmy reputation at work took a huge hit,\nand I was forced to resign."
There's another account of an employee\nwho Akashi falsely accused of fraud. During\nthe litigation, they committed suicide.
Suicide!?
*gasp* If this is all true, we've got a very\ndangerous person on our hands!
Stay calm. They are just internet posts,\nso there's no way to know if they're real.\nThat said...
The "work reform" he's been pushing\ndemoralizes the teachers and makes students\nless trusting of them.
At the very least, I can't see that his work\nas a consultant was done with the best\nintentions in mind.
Rather, he solves problems by force so that\nhe alone is in a position to succeed.
I knew it! I didn't trust that guy\nfrom the start!
So he really set Katayama-san up!?\nDamn that bastard!
And these rumors of people dying...\nCould that be what's in store for her too?
Senpai, what can we do about this!?\nWhat else should we investigate!?
Hold on, Shun! Don't be so rash!\n{NAME2}, talk some sense into him!
You're all far too quick to trust Tanemura.\nWhat if she's secretly on Akashi's side!?
Did that owl just...?
No... Maybe I'm hearing things...
We should figure out why she wants to help\nwith our investigation first, {NAME2}.
"Why?"
Because I felt that you also believed\nin Ms. Katayama and were suspicious\nof Mr. Akashi.
Anyway, that's all the information I have\nto give. Do you all know anything?
My goal? Well...
I just want to know what Mr. Akashi\nis up to. I reached out to you because you're\nsuspicious of him too.
We don't have a clue...
If that's the case, would you help me\nobtain more information?
We can investigate together and share\nthe information we find. \nWhat do you think?
So she's suggesting an alliance of those\nsuspicious of Akashi... A deal of sorts.
It benefits both sides, and seems credible\n enough. What should we do, {NAME2}?
It's settled then. Thank you.
No, thank you! It's really reassuring\nto have you on our side, Riko-senpai!
We're counting on you, Senpai. Sorry for\nbeing a bit confrontational at first...
It's okay. And seeing as we're all only\na year apart, please feel free to speak to me\nmore casually.
So... How are we gonna get the dirt\non Mr. Akashi?
I have an idea, but it will take a bit of\nexplaining. Will you hear me out?
Excuse meeee! Is Mr. Akashi here?
You're the student who had a disagreement\nwith Ms. Katayama. Arai-san, was it?
Ahaha, thanks for coming to my rescue!
Oh?\nBut I thought you were on her side?
No way! That was before I found out\nhow violent she is!
Anyways... I have some ideas to improve\nthe school if you don't mind listening.
Yes, of course. I always have time\nfor students' requests.
Yay! Then I'll cut right to the chase...
I want more pastries in the school store!\nThe selection of sweets is really lacking!
Oh, I also had an idea for a school event!\nI would looove if we could hold\na baseball tournament!
J-Just a moment, Arai-san. It seems this may\nbecome a lengthy discussion, so I'll need to\nset aside time to talk another day.
Perhaps you could take a break now\nto discuss with her?
You must be getting exhausted of all this\ndesk work, Mr. Akashi. I'll finish organizing\nthe data for you.
Awesome! Let's go talk on the roof, Sensei!\nThe breeze up there is great!
Very well. If you insist.\nI'll step out for a moment to talk.
Let's go! Come on!
All right, all right. I'm coming.
As I expected, he left them behind.
He often changes to his tinted glasses\nwhen he's in front of students. Maybe it's\nto look more relatable?
Man, Motoha really knows how to sell it.\nThat act was flawless.
I always thought Motoha had nerves of steel\never since we were kids. I gave her a script\nto work with for today, but...
She really outdid herself.\nI bet she could have a future in theater.
Anyway, keep a lookout while I search.
He's probably not careless enough\nto write down his password. Maybe something\ncan give me a hint...
Messages... Photos...
That's not it. Maybe this'll work...
Hey, you almost done?\nThey'll be back any minute!
Don't worry. I think I've figured it out...
Bingo.
Whoa, for real!?\nHow'd you do that!?
I'll explain later. This takes priority.
There's a hidden folder here filled with\nimage and video files...\nHuh? This is...
I knew it...
Yes, we've got it.\nAll thanks to you three.
Now to copy everything.\nIs there anything else of note?
Motoha is on her way back? Got it.\nYou two should get out of here quickly.
Let's reconvene at the caf\xe9\nin Kichijoji later.
Gotcha.\nBe careful, Senpai.
I'm sorry to make you come all this way\nagain. I thought it best if we met somewhere\nfar from school.
Today is my treat, so order\nwhatever you'd like.
What!? No, that's waaaay too generous!
Without all of you, I couldn't have hacked\nAkashi's PC. It's the least I can do.
Hehe, Motoha's performance particularly\nstole the show.
I can't take all the credit.\nRiko-senpai wrote the script for me!
Besides, I was totally serious about\nthe pastries and baseball tournament!
Oh, so it wasn't just an act...\nThat explains it.
Still, it was very impressive.\nNo one would have doubted you for a second.
So, what would you like to eat, Motoha?
Well, I guess I'll order my fill then!\nLet's see...
So, in regard to Akashi's PC...
I didn't have time to examine everything,\nbut I found several photos and videos\nof Ms. Katayama.
All compiled in their own special folder.
*gasp* That's...
No. If anything,\nI think he's trying to find her weakness.
Case in point, he had copies of the footage\ntaken by those two students stored on his PC.
Wait, didn't Akashi say he deleted that?
Yes. He told the academic coordinator\nas much... but it turns out that was a lie.
So the one who posted her name\nto Divine Justice was...!
I can't say for certain since the post was\nanonymous, but it's highly plausible.
I haven't reviewed all the data yet,\nbut I can contact you once I'm finished.
Yes, please! Thank you so much.
Wait. You should inquire about the password\nto Akashi's PC.
It could be the key to unlocking that door\nin Katayama's Palace.
Oh, good thinkin'!
By the way, Senpai, what was Akashi's\npassword? How'd you figure it out?
Oh right. It was his old employee ID number.
Before Mr. Akashi became a consultant,\napparently he worked at a TV station.
A TV station!?\nWow, that guy really is a big shot...
The album in his smart glasses had a lot\nof photos from that time.
His employee ID was the only close-up,\nso I thought it must be important...
It was worth a try, and I was right.\nOf course, I had several other guesses\nin mind.
You're real sharp.\nIf I had to figure that out, I'd be screwed.
So, um, could you tell us the number?
I suppose so, but why?
Uh, well, you know, it'll be helpful\nif we want to investigate more and stuff.
Since it's you three, I don't mind.\nBut do you promise not to misuse it?
Hm... All right.
On second thought...
W-We'll definitely behave!\nHe's just uhhh, sleepy! Yeah, sleepy.\nIsn't that right...?
Do you have something to write with?
Oh, yeah! Just a sec!\nNotebook, notebook...
Now that we've obtained Akashi's password,\nI'm confident we can get through that lock.
Great!\nLet's head to the Palace right now!
Next stop, Shibuya!
Hey, I'm back.
Oh! Thanks for the meal, Riko-senpai!
Thank you!
You're very welcome.\nSo, where are you all headed?
Oh, um, right. I've got homework and stuff,\nso I should hurry back home!
Yeah, I'm gonna head back and hit the hay.
I see. Take care then.\nBe careful on your way home.
Will do! See you at school, Riko-senpai!
Thanks a bunch!
They're definitely up to something...
What does "heading to the Palace" mean?\nAlso...
The voice that asked for the password...\nIt didn't belong to any of them.
All right, let's get to the Metaverse!
Right. However, this visit may be especially\nchallenging. We'd best prepare accordingly.
You can take care of the shopping, Leader!\nWe'll wait right here for you!
Ready to go?
They said they were going home... What are\nthey doing?
Yeah, let's roll!
Okay, we'll wait here then. Give us a shout\nwhen you're ready!
They vanished!?
But they were here just a sec\u2014!
This notebook... So, they definitely were\nhere.
What is going on? Let me try Motoha...
What's this icon?
*gasp* Where am I!?
How did I...?
Okay, let's review our objective.
We'll head to the third area and go back to\nthat password protected door in Katayama's\nPalace. Understood?
Roger that!
Cattle, do your thing!
What... just happened?
What did I just see? Some... something,\ntransformed into a car, and those three...
Right, let's enter that password. Got your\nnotebook, Shun?
Yeah, one sec.
Hm? That's weird. Where is it?
Huh? Ah! No freakin' way! It's gone!?
What!? You're kidding me! Did you drop it!?
Maybe it's in the car... Sorry, Lufel. I need\nyou to transform again.
Hm? If something were inside me, I think I\nwould know... But if you insist.
Hooaha! Hooahahaha! Th-That tickles! There is\nnothing down there, I swear it!
What the heck? If I dropped it, it should be\naround here...
Hooaaah! Do not pull that! I'm sensitive\nthere!
Hey! That is quite enough! Did you lose it in\nthe real world, perchance!?
Anyway, does no one remember the password!?
No. I had it in my notebook, so I only\nglanced at the number. I think it started\nwith a 9 maybe?
Huh? I thought it was an 8? I remember it\nbeing kind of long...
None of you have the faintest idea, do you!?
You don't remember it either, Cattle?
If you recall, I didn't get to see the\nnumber! I was inside Wonder's bag!
Okay okay, I'm sorry. Don't be mad.
You just riffled through my insides looking\nfor that password! I'm livid!
SKREEEE!
Uh... What are you doing?
That was a warning screech! It means I'm\nfurious with you!
Furious...
It just looked like a cute pose to me.
Well, if it's lost, it's lost. We'll just\nhave to go back to the real world and ask\nRiko-senpai again.
That won't be necessary.
I'm here. And I know the passcode.
Wha\u2014 How\u2014 Huh!?
Riko-senpai!?
Even with those masks, I can tell you're\n{NAME1}-kun, Motoha, and Shun-kun.
And you there, in the strange hood. I heard\nyour voice coming from {NAME1}-kun's\nbag, didn't I?
My word! You could hear me all along?
Please call me Cattle. That is my Metaverse\ncode name.
Cattle-san... It's nice to meet you. Does\neveryone else have code names too?
Hey, this is no time for introductions!\nSenpai, why are you in the Metaverse?
The Metaverse? I see. So this place is a\nuniverse separate from our own? I can't\nbelieve something like this exists.
As to why I'm here... I haven't a\nclue either.
I saw you vanish at Shibuya Station, then\nI opened an odd app on my phone and found\nmyself here.
An odd app? So the Metaverse Navigator was\non your phone too?
The app icon was an eerie looking snake.
I see. Then there's no mistaking it.
This might be a stupid question, but aren't\nwe really far from the entrance right now?
How the heck did you get all this way\nby yourself!?
Oh yeah! You weren't attacked by Shadows,\nuh... I mean, monsters, were you!?
Shadows? I don't know what those are, but I\ndidn't run into any trouble.
I had this one to guide me.
Wha\u2014!? What is that!?
I'm not sure, but I just followed where\nit led me.
There was no other clear path to follow\nafter all. Oh, is it an ally of yours?
No no! We've never seen that thing before!
For a Shadow I'm not sensing much hostility\nfrom it. In fact, it's more like...
Wait. Something is coming.
Wh-What!?
I think my guide is trying to warn us of\nsome hostile danger approaching.
Yes... I sense a malicious presence as well!\nHow could it detect that earlier than I!?
Hey, hang on! What malicious presence are\nwe talkin' about!?
Most likely that cognitive form of Akashi.
With Riko Tanemura here, we can't allow\nourselves to get caught up in a battle!
So retreating is our best option, isn't it?\nIt seems our only path is through that door.
Um, no that's...!
Unknown peril lies beyond those doors.\nWe can't take you with us.
I'd prefer to escort you back to reality,\nbut...!
There is certain danger here, and the\npossibility of danger ahead. In that case,\nshouldn't we proceed forward?
We just need to input Mr. Akashi's password\ninto this keypad, right?
Yeah, but I dropped my notebook that had\nthe password in it!
Amazing...
That's the sound of the Akashi-looking\nShadow thing!
What do we do, Wonder?
We've no choice! Hurry through the door!
If we go back, we'll run into Akashi's\ncognitive form. We have to press ahead,\nWonder!
All right. It should be locked again now.
Oh? It's still locked. I could've sworn I\nsensed an invader prowling around.
But those foolish intruders from the other\nday wouldn't dare return. Heheh.
I think it's gone...
Now that there's no immediate threat, could\nyou explain this place to me?
Right... Where do we even start?
So the "Metaverse" embodies the collective\nunconscious of humankind. And this\ndam facility...
Was created by the twisted desires in\nMs. Katayama's heart. Is that correct?
Damn, you caught on fast...!
Riko-senpai's on a whole other playing field\nthan us.
And this world representing Ms. Katayama's\nheart is, for some reason, protected by\nMr. Akashi.
That's why you were looking into him.
Precisely. You are truly quite astute...
Cattle-san, are you certain this is\nMs. Katayama's Palace?
Just Cattle is fine. And yes. We were led\nhere by the collective unconscious using\nher name.
Hence, this is surely Katayama's Palace.\nYet, the presence of Akashi remains\nan enigma.
Yes, it is odd. I can't imagine the real\nMs. Katayama depending on Mr. Akashi in\nany way.
In fact, she seems hostile toward him.
Right? It's real weird.
But Mr. Akashi's password opened the door\njust now...
Why would Ms. Katayama make someone else's\npassword the key to her heart?
That would imply a deep trust between them.\nOr perhaps, dependency?
Or maybe... she's being exploited?
Circling back, there's no reason\nMs. Katayama could ever know his password in\nthe first place.
True. I mean, unless they're actually a\ncouple or something...
No way! Not in a million years!
In that case, his password shouldn't have\nopened that door.
Through exploitation, control, hijacking...\nOr maybe...?
No. Without more information, all we can do\nis speculate.
If we can't go back, let's keep movin'\nforward. Maybe we'll find a hint in the Palace.
I'd rather not explore with a Persona-less\nhuman in tow, but we haven't much choice.
Let's continue our search while keeping\nRiko Tanemura safe.
The Akashi cognition is likely still beyond\nthat door.
We must continue onward, Wonder.
The hell is that?
A projection of a classroom? Seems like it's\nplaying some kind of video...
I'll use this spray and a lighter to make\na flamethrower!
Violence is prohibited.
What kind of teacher calls a parent's\nworkplace just because they didn't answer\nthe phone!?
Your son has been absent for three days\nin a row with no explanation!
Who cares! He's just a high school kid!\nThat's no excuse to embarrass me at work!
You should be more concerned about your\nchild than your reputation!
Invasions of privacy are prohibited.
What was that?
That was footage of the lighter incident,\nwasn't it?
The scene after that was Ms. Katayama\nand... someone's dad?
Oh, another video is starting.
Is it true you fired Kano-kun? He really\nseemed to love this job.
I asked him about it, but he just said that\nit was his own fault.
Sorry, Kumi-chan. The truth is...
He threw water on a food critic!?
Yeah, but Shun was justified. It seemed like\nMiyazawa was trying to hurt our shop.
Forget about that. Right now Kano-kun needs\nus to protect him.
If that video goes public, his future will\nbe ruined. I'll talk to the TV station.
So, please, don't give up on Kano-kun.
Meddling in private affairs is prohibited.
So that's why the video of you throwing\nwater at Miyazawa never aired...
Yeah, I heard from Masa-san afterward.
Katayama-san begged the TV station and a\nbunch of other people...
All to protect me... Even though it was\nmy fault!
Sir, I'm here today to discuss your\ndaughter Riko.
This one's about Riko-senpai?\nYour hair's shorter...
This was...
It was when I was a first-year student.
That's right. Just before this, Sensei...
Tanemura-san, wanna walk home together?
A group of us are gonna hang out in Shibuya.\nYou should join us!
Sorry, I have a committee meeting today.
I'll see you tomorrow. Have a nice time.
See? I told you she'd say no. Tanemura-san\ncan't hang.
It's always some excuse with her. Helping\nher family, committee meetings, studying...\nShe's so cold!
If she doesn't wanna hang out with us, she\nshould just say so.
Little miss honor student heiress can't\nassociate with peasants like us! Haha!
For the sake of my future, perhaps I should\ninteract with my classmates more often.
For the sake of your future? That's not\nquite why you should do it.
Got a minute?
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard,\nTanemura-san?
I understand and admire your dedication to\nyour studies and your family business, but...
I'm a bit concerned about whether or not\nthis is what you really want.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem\ntrapped.
It's as if everything you do is based on if\nyou think it will help your family business.
I'm not forcing myself to.
It is true that I take my family's company\ninto account when making decisions, but...
That's because I personally believe doing so\nis for the best.
I feel that Riko-san is under excessive\npressure as Umetane's successor.
It's both wonderful and important to study\nhard and help one's family, but...
Right now, it seems she has no space\nto decompress.
School is a time for kids to broaden their\nhorizons and find themselves.
So I'd like to ask you to consider letting\nyour daughter follow her heart.
I agree with your sentiment, however, that\ntime for Riko has long since passed.
I do not push her in the least. I support\nwhat she wants to do.
Right, Riko?
Yes... As your only child, it is my duty to\ninherit Umetane...
I mean, I believe it is the best path for\nme. This is what I want, Ms. Katayama.
If we've reached an understanding, then\nplease be on your way.
But Riko-san is...!
Meddling in family affairs is prohibited.
I remember that day.
These are Ms. Katayama's memories.\nRight, Cattle?
Indeed. These moments must have had a deep\nimpact on her.
They also show that Katayama harbors a\nstrong desire to support and protect\nher students.
Yeah, Katayama-san's an amazing teacher!
But from what we've just seen, her desire is\nbeing condemned, forbidden, and warped.
It's possible her heart is starting to\nabandon it.
Bein' supportive of your students is a\ngood thing! Why is she getting flack\nfor that!?
Isn't that exactly what's going on at school\nright now?
Akashi's consulting has made the teachers\nignore the students and overwork Riko-senpai.
If you really think about it, it's more like\nAkashi stole Katayama-san's desire, huh?
Wait, so is this Akashi's Palace after all!?
Hoom... Based on the collective unconscious,\nwe thought this was Katayama's Palace, but...
Perhaps there has been a mix-up. Something\ncertainly feels amiss.
Let's investigate further and get to the\nbottom of this.
If Ms. Katayama's desire is to support\nher students...
Then the one who denied that is...
Huh? What is this place?
Looks like we're outside.
This is less than ideal. There are few\nplaces to hide.
I'd like to avoid a battle while Riko\nTanemura is with us. We should search for\nanother route.
True. I bet that Pseudo-Akashi is gone by\nnow, so if we head back the way we came...
Tanemura-san?
Is that... Ms. Katayama!?
It's her Shadow!
That's... a Shadow?
The ruler appears at last. I would rather\navoid a fight with Tanemura here, but...!
Tanemura-san... Why are you here?
It's too dangerous... Turn back... Hurry...
Right! Stand at the ready!
She's not going to attack us, is she?
I don't think so. If anything, she seems\nworried about us.
She's not like Kiuchi and Miyazawa at all.\nIf we try talking to her, she might just give\nus her Treasure.
Sensei, we want to help you.
Please, tell us why this Palace exists!
Wait... Are you all\u2014
Ngh...!
Wh-What's going on...!?
It's no use! Get out now.\nIt's too... dangerous.
Sensei?
Just leave... Hurry...
You okay, Sensei!?
Aaaaagh!
I'm tellin' you to scram!!
Ngh... Aaagh! Aagh!
Agh! Please, stop! We don't wanna hurt you!
Her twisted desires are running wild! If we\nlet our guard down, we're done for!
We can't allow ourselves to lose here! We'll\nhave to deal some damage to her!
There's really no other choice?\nI'm sorry, Sensei!
No... Stop it... I don't want to fight...
Her power is intensifying! She must be\nplanning something!
Katayama-san! Please, listen to us!
Huh? Katayama's Shadow is acting strange.
I refuse to...hurt my students!
Argh!
Aaaaaaaaagh!
Please! Run!
Nghhh... No...! I don't want to...\nhurt anyone!
What's going on? She's crying out to stop\nthe fight? She looks like she's in agony...
Did you see that light sparking around her\njust now?
It's that light again!
Is that electricity controlling her!?
Katayama's Shadow is charged with even more\npower than before! Brace\nyourselves, everyone!
Please, no more! I'm begging you!
What's going on!? Ms. Katayama's in so\nmuch pain!
Sensei, Listen! You don't wanna fight either,\nright? Let's all calm down!
*gasp* Everyone, up there!
Aaaagh!
Is that Akashi!?
But why? Isn't that Ms. Katayama's\nown cognition?
Why would it attack her!?
Wait... That's it. At last I understand!
Akashi and Katayama both rule this Palace!
What!? What does that mean!?
Yes. I was uncertain at first because of\nAkashi's weak aura, but...
There's no mistake. They possess the will of\ntwo distinct human beings.
It's not a question of who is the cognition\nof who...
They are both individual Shadows!
Two rulers in one Palace? Is that\neven possible!?
I am shocked as well. I never imagined such\na phenomenon would occur.
What do you think you're doing, Ms. Katayama?\nIt's your job to eliminate intruders.
No! Please... I can't...hurt my students!
A bit late for that, isn't it!?
Come on, you're the violent Ms. K of\nK Academy! Now give those kids a good beating!
No... You're wrong! I\u2014
You'll never be allowed to return to school\nagain. And now you can't even punish the\nstudents like the Menace you are?
You are completely worthless!
I'll give you a hand, so at least try to\nserve as a good body shield!
Damn it! What do we do now!?
Katayama's Shadow is already at death's\ndoor. Another attack might put her life\nat risk!
First let's take out the other Shadows!
I told you to run... Why won't you go? I'm\nnot even sure...what I'm doing anymore...
Please, get away from me... I might... I'm\u2014
Must punish... bad students!
She's focused her aim on one of us! Keep\nyour guard up and defend yourselves!
I won't attack Katayama-san! She's just\nbeing controlled by that bastard!
Like Cattle said, let's deal with the other\nShadows first!
No... Stop it... I can't punish them...\nI won't hurt my students!
*sigh* You really are useless! But exploiting\nthat incompetence...
...is part of my consulting expertise!
Damn it! Get down here, you little\nchickenshit!
Hahaha! I prefer to let others handle my\ndirty work.
So you like to pass the buck? That's just\nlike the real Akashi!
Please...
Kill...me...
My body...won't listen to me...
I don't want...to hurt you!
W-We could never do that to you!
*sigh* What's with all the melodrama?\nWhat kind of sappy soap is this?
Oh, here's a pitch! Let's play "Who looks\nweakest?" I spy a young lady in uniform.
My, if it isn't Tanemura-san! Tsk tsk...\nA blueblood should know better than\nto trespass!
Now, give Tanemura-san a swift bashing!\nYou can handle that much, can't you?
I am such a considerate consultant!
No! Stop! I don't want to!
Enough!
Stop resisting, Sensei!
If you're in pain, then hit me. It's simple!
Why fight it this much!?
I could...never do that!
You're my...precious student...
I'm just one of hundreds, aren't I?
Don't carry on the teacher act even inside\nyour own heart. Just hit me and stop\nsuffering, Ms. Katayama!
No... I'm not forcing myself to act like\na teacher.
I really want to be a proper one.
Someone who's always there to listen and\nhelp the students...
But I'm a terrible, selfish, unfair teacher.\nI'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry...
I don't want... to lose... myself. I will\nnever... betray... my students.
Whatever happens... I want to stay... your\nteacher... until the very end!
Why? Even though I pushed you away...
Why do you keep reaching out to me? Why do\nyou put yourself at risk to protect me?
Hahaha, this really is a soap opera!
Mushy school stories about passionate\nteachers get terrible ratings these days!
The masses want to see a hot-headed teacher\nwho talks with their fists. Now...
If you want to prove you're not useless,\nthen play the role expected of you!
Look, Dad! I got a 90 on my test!
90... Did anyone get 100?
I think so...
I see. Then study harder to be number one\nnext time.
You will inherit Umetane's legacy one day.\nAnd leaders do not show weakness.
Devote yourself to achieving consistent\ngrades that won't bring embarrassment on our\nname. Understood?
...Understood.
I was only nice to you because you're the\npresident's daughter.
Haha... Do you honestly think people love\nyou for you?
If you weren't the heir to Umetane, no one\nwould even look at you!
People are only kind to me because I'm the\nheir to Umetane.
If I want to be treated with respect, I have\nto become worthy of my title.
If I want to be loved... No.
There is no love for me in this world. I have\nto give up on it.
Honor student. Worthy heir.
The perfect daughter my parents want.
I'll keep playing the role expected of me.
"Play the role expected of you"?
How stupid...
I've had someone who loves me for me\nall along!
She was always reaching out to me, but I\njust kept...
...pushing her away!
You're wrong...
I wasn't able to earn your trust. We adults\nare to blame.
A child's only job... is to receive love.
Your parents... and I... failed to give\nthat to you.
No, Sensei. I'm the one who gave up on\ntrusting anyone.
I told myself that if love meant risking\nrejection, then I didn't need it.
I shut myself off from it altogether. But...
Unconditional love was always right there\nin front of me!
Ugh! I told you people, that saccharine\nsitcom schtick will only bore viewers\nto tears.
Wait... Don't tell me... You really hoped\nsomeone would love you?
Ahahahaha! Don't be absurd! Love and rich\ngirls are like oil and water! You really\nare a fool!
You'll never have love. After all, every\nsingle person in your life...
...is only after Umetane's wealth and\ninfluence!
How dare you!
Ah, but if it's words of love you want to\nhear, I'm happy to oblige.
I looove you, Tanemura-san! What a talented\nyoung lady you are!
Shut up.
...Huh?
I said shut up. Your empty words repulse me.
You are a lying coward...
...whose only talents are treachery and\nexploitation!
Wh-Wh-What are you lackeys waiting for!?\nDispose of them!
Watch out!
Ngh\u2014!
Please... run! I can't... fight it!
But...!
We can't let ourselves be done in! We have\nno choice but to defeat Kumi Katayama's\nShadow.
It's all right.
Hahahah. Now you're finished!
Stop it...!
Is that...?
You... Just as I thought.
I understand now.
Ms. Katayama, I won't give up anymore.
I will save you. I promise.
You! The monster that exploited my teacher's\nlove for her students\u2014Kei Akashi! I will\ntake back everything you've stolen!
I shall see that resolve carried out.
Should you reach out to take hold of that\nwhich you feared, relinquished,\nand abandoned...
...the path ahead will prove tempestuous.\nBut I presume you are well aware.
Now soar ahead, heedless of the muck and\ndark isolation that surround you...
Reclaim that desire called Love!
Whoa! I can't believe Riko-senpai has\na Persona!
Come... Let us race through fields and\nforests, and dance across the sky!
For I am thou...
She's flying!?
Is that... a Persona?
It would seem so. But I've never seen one\nlike it before!
Incredible...
Katayama-san!
Wh-Wh-What're you gawking at!? Grab that\nuseless teacher!
The rest of you, take care of these\nintruders! Hop to it!
Everyone ready?
It's time for a counterattack.
I apologize for the wait. This one's\nabilities seem quite invaluable.
There's no time to talk! This Shadow is\nincredibly strong!
Leave it to me. I will be the wind at\nyour backs!
Phew! Managed to pull through somehow.
But Akashi took Katayama-san. We gotta\nsave her ASAP!
Yes, we should hurry...
Are you okay, Riko-senpai!?
She's exhausted from her Persona awakening.
Let's prioritize returning to the real world\nto let Riko Tanemura rest.
The Shadows are on high alert now anyway.
But what about Ms. Katayama!?
He's right. We only made it through that last\nbattle thanks to you, Senpai.
You must be wiped. You can lean on my\nshoulder if you need.
Uh, no, no. I'll do it!
Huh? Why?
Well, a) Riko-senpai is a girl, and\nb) you're kinda ham-fisted, Soy.
Ham-fisted!?
But did Motoha not say she was concerned\nas a fellow girl?
Piggyback!? Um, no. Veto! If anyone's going\nto do it, it'll be me!
In your arms!? Oh, but I guess Wonder would\nbe gentle... probably?
Why does that feel like a dig at me?
Hehe, don't worry. I can walk just fine.
However, I would like a safe place to stop\nand catch my breath if possible.
You got it! Let's get back to the real world,\nWonder!
I know I've said this already, but I can't\nbelieve you have a Persona too, Senpai!
Persona... So that's what they're called.
It feels like Chiyome was always watching\nover me, even in the Metaverse...
Even before you fully awakened to her, she\nwas still giving you support.
I've been curious about this for quite some\ntime. In this world of withering desire...
...not only did Tanemura stir us to\ninvestigate Akashi, she also put herself at\ngreat personal risk doing so.
That is likely when your potential desire\nbloomed and your Persona partially awakened.
That voice... Cattle?
Correct. In the real world, my name is Lufel.\nThis form is quite modish, wouldn't you say?
I see. Then the voice I heard came from the\nowl hiding in {NAME1}-kun's bag...
Perhaps I heard you in the caf\xe9 because I\nwas starting to awaken.
That's quite probably the case.
By the way, my owl form is quite modish,\ndon't you think?
Didn't you just ask that?
I bet he wants you to say, "Yes!\nVery modish!"
Hehe, what an avaricious little owl. But I\nwould say it's more soign\xe9, wouldn't\nyou agree?
Hoohoo! Finally, someone who gets it!
Swan... Yay?
In modern terms, it means stylish. Something\nthat is simple yet elegant.
First time I heard of it...
Yes! Finally! Someone who understands what\nI'm talking about! Aren't Motoha and Shun\nutterly exasperating!?
What!? No way! I thought you had our\nbacks, {NAME2}!
T-Traitor!
Y-Yeah! He can't expect the average\nhigh schooler to understand such hard words!
Exactly! Wait, why are you looking at me!?
Hey, this is the part where you agree!
Hehe. I'm sorry to interrupt your\nconversation, but...
I'm starting to feel the day's exhaustion\ncatching up with me. I'd like to get home\nand lay down.
Oh right, my apologies. We came back here\nso you could rest.
Oh! I'll walk you home!
That's all right, I'll call a car. Thank you,\nMotoha.
Well then, I'll see you all at school.\nLet's talk more then.
All right, we should all retire as well.\nGet some well-earned rest, everyone.
I'm glad Tanemura got home safe. Now, we\nought to retire as well.
I have disturbed your precious sleep at the\nbehest of my master who wishes a word.
Ah, do not be alarmed. I simply hope to speak\nwith you as usual.
So, without further delay... There is a\nparticular question I would like you\nto answer.
I understand there exist two ways...
...for hopeless individuals to rejuvenate\ntheir withered desire.
One can spend years interacting with others,\nfumbling to grasp at just a little...
Or...
They can amass indomitable influence to\nmanipulate and consume the desires of others.
Which do you... No. Let me ask you\nthis way...
If it were you, which method would\nyou chose?
*chuckle* As I expected.
Oh? *chuckle* What an uncharacteristic\nresponse.
*chuckle* I see. Is that how you feel...
These methods both have the power to\ndrive desire.
But if either seeks supremacy...
...an inevitable battle with ensue.
Regarding your efforts to strengthen\nyour desire, please be aware my master values\nthe achievements you have made thus far.
*chuckle* Now, I wish to discuss\nthis"mastermind" you all speak of.
Well, as I have said, we cannot grant you\nthe answers you seek on this journey.
To escape imminent ruin...\nyou must remain on the winning side.
That fact... is ever constant.
I see. So, the confessions from Kiuchi\nand Hiromu Miyazawa were a result\nof your "work."
Indeed. Now our next targets are Katayama\nand Akashi.
But why do they both have a Palace in the\nsame place?
Kiuchi and Miyazawa's were in separate areas.
To be more precise, the two of them exist as\nthe rulers of one Palace.
A single Palace co-ruled by both of them.\nA "Joint Palace," if you will.
A Joint Palace? Why the heck did that happen?
Why indeed. Well, my thoughts are...
Firstly, I believe the fact that Akashi and\nKatayama are connected in the real world is\na large part of it.
So in the Metaverse, that toxic connection\nentangled their twisted desires as their\nShadows began clashing.
In short, their negative emotions have\nsynergized, amplifying one another's\ntwisted desires.
Those melded desires most likely resulted\nin a Joint Palace.
Ms. Katayama lost control of herself and her\ndesire because Akashi put her in a corner.
However, that was his intention. His\nprovocations sent her into a downward spiral.
Then the Palace came about. That was likely\npart of his scheme as well.
I've mentioned before that Akashi was\nformerly a business consultant, right?
Well, I did some digging into the companies\nhe worked with.
"The company culture improved once that\nmeticulous old-timer finally hit the bricks."
"I'm glad that useless daydreamer\ngot canned."
There is always an obvious villain.
So, what, a seasoned veteran can't\nhave opinions!?
People SHOULD talk about their dreams!
Yes, I agree.
Employees are not a hive mind. Firing\nsomeone just because you don't agree with\nthem is... odd.
A real consultant doesn't place blame. They\nfix inefficiency and unfair practices.
Even if an employee is an ill fit for a team,\nit's better for everyone to cooperate and\naim for success together.
However... Akashi's success stories almost\nalways revolve around a "villain."
Getting rid of them makes management look\nproactive, and Akashi receives all\nthe credit.
So you mean he...!
That's my guess. Even so...
They're not exactly false accusations. Every\ncompany has its share of bad apples\nafter all.
But this number of long-time, dedicated\nemployees suddenly being incriminated right\nafter Akashi arrives...
...is too high to be plausible.
You mean to say Akashi was actively sowing\nthe seeds of discord at these companies?
There's something else too. Take a look\nat this...
Divine Justice? That's the "Hit-and-Run\nRider" everyone's talking about.
The Hit-and-Run Rider is... Ms. Katayama.
I found this video on Akashi's computer.
She changes into a delivery uniform in a\npublic bathroom, then races off on a bicycle.
No way... This can't be real.
Unfortunately, it's the truth. This video\nalso means...
Akashi already knew Ms. Katayama was the\nHit-and-Run Rider.
He knew she'd be an easy target to make into\na Menace and fill his villain role.
That's why he started shit with her? So she'd\nbe labeled violent!?
And he's trying to get her fired just so he\ncan look like some great consultant!
That's right. Also, I assume Akashi wears\nsmart glasses as a means to catch his\n"villains" in the act.
Once he gets them on tape, it becomes\nimpossible for them to escape accusation.
And I said before, many of his victims have\nsuffered severe emotional dysregulation...\nand even lost their lives.
Then if Akashi is stealing Katayama's\ndesires away...
She might end up the same!?
I can't say for sure.
But if we ignore Akashi, more people will\nfall victim.
While the police stay totally oblivious...
And that bastard keeps sacrificing good\npeople like Ms. Katayama for his own gain!
Oh yeah! {NAME2} got hit once on\nthe train!
So that behavior was going on long before\nAkashi came into the picture.
Which means he can't be the cause of\nMs. Katayama's reckless cycling habit.
Yeah... I guess you're right...
Yamagoshi-san and Masa-san told us she used\nto ride her bike for hours whenever she\ngot upset.
I get that it must clear her head, but\nterrorizing the neighborhood is not\nso great, huh...
Ms. Katayama probably rides to release her\npent-up stress from school.
And I am surely one source of that\nfrustration.
You guys aren't the only ones at fault.\nI used to be kinda scared of her, and it\nprobably showed...
Yeah... I worried her constantly and didn't\nask for help when I needed it.
I understand how you all feel, but can we\nreturn to the topic at hand?
We are the only ones who can stop Akashi\nand Katayama's Shadows from running amuck\nafter all.
You're right. Thank you, Lufel. Now, to\ncontinue explaining my thoughts...
Ms. Katayama's Palace is a dam, correct?
Yeah. I thought it was 'cause she used to\nride her bike there like Masa-san said.
That is one possibility... But something\noccurred to me as Lufel spoke just now.
What if the dam symbolizes the relationship\nbetween the two rulers?
Their relationship?
Ms. Katayama's stifled frustration or, rage\nreally, which she can only release\non her bike...
In a way, Akashi is feeding off of it to\nimprove his own station.
So the dam turns Katayama's wrath into\nenergy, which Akashi absorbs?
Oh yeah! When we first saw him, he stuck a\ncable into the ground to heal himself!
Then he's leeching off the dam's energy!?\nNo... He's leeching off Katayama-san's heart!
Yes. Moreover, Akashi's password was the key\nto that door in the Palace.
So, between their two Shadows, he seems to\nbe the one in charge.
In other words, the dam is under his control,\nand Ms. Katayama is just being\nexploited by him.
Shit! Before he started leechin', he wasn't\neven a speck on Lufel's radar!
Well, his presence was weaker than the\nShadows in Mementos.
Really? Then...
Perhaps rather than controlling her, he's\nmore like a parasite.
That makes way more sense! I can't picture\nMs. Katayama being controlled by anyone!
So, to summarize...
As long as Akashi continues to absorb\nKatayama's energy, his Shadow is invincible.
This means we can't steal Akashi's Treasure.\nWe will need to cut off his source of\npower first.
But to do that, we'll need to steal\nKatayama's Treasure and invoke a change\nof heart.
Change Katayama-san's heart...?
Honestly, Akashi aside, I never believed\nKatayama-san could be a Palace ruler.
If she's got repressed anger she can only\nlet out by pullin' risky stunts in secret...
...then I wanna free her from that. That way\nI can at least sorta pay her back\nfor everythin'.
Don't put this all on yourself, Kano-kun.
I played no small part in Ms. Katayama's\ndesires getting twisted.
Until going into her Palace and seeing who\nshe really is, I didn't trust Ms. Katayama...
But she truly cares for all of her students.\nWe can't let that creep treat her like an\nenergy drink anymore. Right, {NAME2}?
I concur. Well, that gives us a\nunanimous decision.
Our target is clear, so our next objective is\nto secure a route to her Treasure.
Right. Let's head back to the Palace and\nsniff it out.
Oh, but first...
There's something I'd like to do before we\nreturn to the Palace.
H-Hold on! Are we really going in there,\nRiko-senpai!?
Ms. Katayama often comes here to drink.\nAnother tidbit from Akashi's surveillance.
And we can't meet her at school because\nshe's suspended, remember?
But, we're minors. Won't we get arrested\nor somethin'?
Don't worry, it's not like we're going to\norder drinks. Besides...
I can just say the disciplinary committee is\nhere to check for errant students.
Yep, that's our Riko-senpai.
Let's head in.
I knew it. It's that kid with the owl... But\nwhat are they doing going into a bar?
There's another person with them too...
Could they be...?
Welcome! Oh my, quite the young folks,\naren't you?
Don't worry, we won't drink. We'll... just be\na few minutes.
Ms. Katayama.
Huh!? Wha\u2014? Tanemura-san!? Where'd you all\ncome from!?
You're minors! What are you doing here!?
We can't meet at school since the suspension,\nso we came to you instead.
S-Still... You shouldn't be here.
First let me say...
I'm sorry, Sensei.
Huh? Wait, for what?
Ever since I was a first-year, you've always\nreached out to me. And yet...
I convinced myself that you didn't really\ncare, and treated you coldly because of it.
I remember the cruel things I said to you...\nCalling you overbearing...
Tanemura-san...?
This is long overdue, but the truth is,\nI was happy.
Or rather, I never appreciated how happy your\nconcern made me until now.
You always gave me everything I had\nabandoned. All of the support and care...
Haha, what on earth's gotten into you?
I'm sure it's hard to believe. After all, I\nnever let myself trust you, Sensei.
That's why, even if you're not convinced,\nI won't give up on you.
Just as you never gave up on me...
Oh, Tanemura-san...
I believe you. Of course I believe you.
I'm not sure what happened, but I'm so happy\nto hear you say that. Thank you...
But I can't be your teacher anymore.
I'm a Menace on indefinite suspension.
And more than anything else, I'm just...\nso... tired.
Oh that's right. You are the\nHit-and-Run Rider, after all.
What!? How do you know about that!?
Senpai! Not here...!
How shameful. A teacher should set a good\nexample. Not go on reckless joyrides.
The disciplinary committee can't ignore this.
I-I'm sorry. I...
Therefore, I'm going to steal your warped\ndesires away from you.
I'll put you back on the straight and narrow!
What does that mean...?
So... Please come back to school soon!
Ms. Katayama!
I'm sorry too! You were worried about me, but\nI just acted like a brat and made\nthings worse.
But I really rely on and look up to you\nso much! Like, a lot!
Things aren't right without you at school.\nIt's too weird!
You're our homeroom teacher! Please come back\nto school soon!
Arai-san...
{NAME1}-kun...
Hooky? Haha...
Thank you... for accepting a pathetic teacher\nlike me.
Oh my... You've been blessed with such\nwonderful students, Kumi-chan.
Head straight home, okay? And be careful.
Yes, Sensei!
Hm? What is it, Kano-kun?
Well, I just gotta ask... Why'd you start\nriding crazy on your bike?
That's always been my form of stress relief.\nWhen I hit those pedals, I can\nforget everything.
But even though it always felt great in the\npast... Lately, for some reason...
My body suddenly heats up, and I feel like I\ncan't control myself.
After all these years, I'm still the same\nwild, hot-headed delinquent.
I need to grow up already. I want to\napologize to everyone I hurt.
Thanks for coming to see me today. I've got\nsome self-reflecting to do.
What's wrong, Lufel?
In Katayama's inner world, she absolutely\nrefused to strike her students at the cost\nof her own safety.
It's incomprehensible how one of such mental\nfortitude could surrender to blind rage.
What do ya mean?
Well, I have no conclusive evidence.\nForget I mentioned it.
Anyways, Katayama-san's warped desire is\nbetter now, right?
I wonder if her Palace is gone.
That's not likely. If Katayama were the\nsole ruler, perhaps...
But that Palace represents the convergence\nof two individual's desires, with Akashi's\nShadow acting as a parasite.
Still... the Palace itself has likely\nchanged. Once we've made our preparations,\nlet's put our plan in motion.
Well, we should head home. Let's walk to the\nstation together to avoid getting distracted\nwith unnecessary pitstops.
Ahaha! Never change, Riko-senpai!
Metaverse...? Palace...?
So, what's the plan for today? I would like\nto check on Katayama's Palace, but...
Honestly, I don't even remember crashing\nthrough the train like it said on\nDivine Justice.
B-But there's photo evidence everywhere, so\nI shouldn't be making excuses. I'm sorry.
It's up to your judgement, Leader.
Hey guys, we've been using Riko-senpai's\nreal name here, but...
Isn't she a Phantom Thief now?
I would hope so, but... Is it all right with\nour leader?
Thank you. It's an honor to work together.
The honor is ours. In addition to proving\nyourself more than capable in battle,\nyou also possess a sharp intellect.
How would you like to act as the\nPhantom Thieves' brain and chief strategist?
Oh yeah, we could use one of those.
Ooh, Chief Strategist? That sounds so cool!\nWe're startin' to seem pretty legit, huh?
"Strategist"? Am I really qualified for that?
You're the only one qualified, Riko-senpai!\nYou've got my vote!
Not like your vote counts for much, Closer.
That would be hurtful coming from anyone\nbut you, Soy.
Hehe, very well. I'll assume the role of the\nPhantom Thieves' Chief Strategist.
On that note, everyone calls each other by\ncode names here, like "Closer" and\n"Soy," right?
Oh yeah, I forgot! You haven't picked a\ncode name yet!
Wonder, Cattle, Closer, Soy... How did you\nall decide on your names?
We each chose something we think is strange\nor mysterious.
Anythin' come to mind, Senpai?
Something mysterious? Let's see...
What about "Wind"?
Wind? Ooh, I love it!
But what is it you find mysterious\nabout wind?
I've always wondered why the word for\n"disciplinary committee" uses the kanji\nfor wind.
The same character appears in many words\nrelating to the core values of a culture or\nthe characteristics of a region.
Is that because it pertains to the feeling\nor "air" of a particular locality? It's hard\nto be sure.
Huh... Smart people think about the\nweirdest things.
Is it really that weird? Well... I haven't\ndone any proper research or anything. It just\nstruck me as odd.
What does wink have to do with anything?\nOther than kind of rhyming...
Hmmm... Wink doesn't feel all that\nmysterious.
And with a code name like that, it sounds\nlike you just blink a lot.
Wind is a great name! It's light, refreshing,\nand fits you to a T!
It matches your Persona too!
Yes... Taking Chiyome's abilities into\naccount, I believe I could serve best in a\nsupport role.
I wish to be the wind at my allies' backs\nand a cyclone against my foes.
Excellent. Then you'll henceforth be known\nas "Wind."
Uh, should we call you Wind-senpai in\nthe Metaverse?
You can drop "senpai." I'd like everyone to\nspeak to me casually going forward.
As a Phantom Thief, I'm the newcomer here.\nAnd as allies, we're all equals, are we not?
Oh, okay then! Welcome to the team, Wind!
Yes, it's wonderful to work with you,\nWonder. Well then, shall we be off?
What the heck!? This place looks\ntotally different!
The water level is lower!
It seems just as Wind surmised, this Palace\nis a dam powered by Katayama's anger.
Which would make this reservoir a\nmanifestation of her wrath and other negative\nemotions building up.
So, the dam is drying up now that we've\nresolved those feelings in the real world?
Yes. It's proof that your feelings\nreached her.
Thank goodness...
Now, let us hunt for the Treasure.
Katayama's Treasure is surprisingly close.\nI sense it in that direction.
Looks like we can go that way now that the\nwater level is lower.
Katayama-san... We'll save you. Just hang on\na bit longer!
We should prioritize finding Katayama's\nTreasure.
This is no time to be checking every nook\nand cranny, Wonder.
I sense the Treasure nearby...\nAnd something else...
A powerful Shadow. It must be\nMs. Katayama...
It seems the Treasure is higher above us.\nLet's keep going upward.
I feel it... The Treasure is here.
And... Ms. Katayama is too.
Tanemura-san, I'm glad you're here.
And you three as well. Kano-kun, Arai-san,\n{NAME1}-kun...
Are you okay, Katayama-san!? Wait...
How'd you know it was us?
Of course I know. I'm your teacher after all.
You're here for this, right?
That's Ms. Katayama's Treasure!
But how is it visible? We didn't send out a\ncalling card, did we?
Yeah, how is it visible already? We didn't\neven send out a calling card yet.
A calling card's purpose is to alert the\nperson that their Treasure will be stolen.
If I had to guess, what Wind said to Katayama\nin that bar...
It must have had the same effect as a\ncalling card.
You came for this, didn't you?
It's dear to me, but go on, take it.
Huh? Really!? You sure?
Yes, it's fine.
But, it's your most precious desire,\nisn't it?
If we steal it, and the worst happens...\nyou might not want to be a teacher anymore.
This is a manga about a delinquent teacher\nthat was popular back in my day.\nIt's my Bible.
I was a wild child then, but there was a\ncertain teacher that saved me from myself.
I admired them so much, I aspired to be a\npassionate teacher like that. Someone who\nfaces their students head-on.
Those feelings were real, but...
Somewhere along the line, I became hooked\non playing the hot-blooded teacher.
So I want to start over... Forget about\nacting like a hero, and actually try to\nmeet my students where they're at.
So go on, take it.
We can't disregard her feelings. Let's steal\nit, Wonder.
Ms. Katayama, please, wake up!
Why...? Why did this happen!?
Katayama-san... This can't be real...
All because that power was sent into her...\nNow it's too...
What's wrong, Wonder?
Don't tell me...
You "saw" something again, didn't you?
...! This aura... It's...!
All right, all right. That's enough! Wrap it\nup, Ms. Katayama!
Katayama-san!?
I already told you people. No one wants to\nsee your tearful coming-of-age drama.
What the heck was that...!?
...Where?
Show yourself, Akashi! You... You coward!
Katayama-san! Hang on!
The people want violence! Shock value!
Ms. Violent Teacher's about to star in her\nvery own slaughter show!
Sensei... No...
What's happening to her!?
He's forcing her Shadow to go berserk!\nEveryone, get ready!
Akashi...
AKASHIII!
No... I won't hurt...my students...
I am a violent teacher...
Katayama's wrathful desires are being\namplified... That cable is injecting some\nkind of power into her.
Her wings... Are those eyes?
Bastard! How could you do this to her!?
Hey, did that eyeball just get dimmer?
After it attacked us, the light became\nweaker... It seems to reflect her\nremaining power level.
Hm... As Katayama releases her wrath through\nthose attacks, the light in the eyes grows\nfaint. However...
She will likely recover before too long.\nIf the light gets stronger, her attacks will\nlikely intensify as well.
Seems so. Let's keep that in mind.
Katayama's desire... Has the power of her\nwrath subsided?
Then is she back to her old self!?
Katayama-san! Hey, Katayama-san!
She's not attacking, but I don't think she\nhears us either.
She's suppressing her own desire. What\nastounding mental fortitude!
Still, I don't know how long she can\nhold out. Let's take this chance to regroup!
Ugh, come on already! What do you think\nyou're doing!? Kill them!
Unleash your rage! Let it burn!
No... Nooooo...!
He's using that weird power on her again!
This isn't good. He's amplifying her anger...
If that surge of power persists, Katayama's\nmind won't survive!
One wrong move and she could be permanently\ninjured... She may even lose her life!
Cut the power? You mean beat Akashi!?
But he's hiding somewhere! How are we\nsupposed to stop him!?
In that case... our only option is to cut\nthe cable.
Of course! No matter how much we fight,\nas long that energy source persists...
Katayama's Shadow will be revived and forced\nto do battle!
If we cut that cable, we can free her from\nAkashi's control!
No, wait! Even if you cut it, the cycle will\nrepeat if Akashi connects a new cable.
Then what do we do!?
Give me time, leader. I promise I'll find\na way to save Ms. Katayama!
Okay! Just hold out for a little!
One order of Grade A stalling, comin'\nright up! Countin' on ya, Wind!
Please hold on, Ms. Katayama...!
What!? Again!? Enough with the turtle act!\nWe all know you're a raging bull!
I... I, I, I...!
I'm useless...
Ah... Arghh... I... have to keep it together...
That red light... This is bad! Her wrath has\nreached its peak! Everyone, get ready!
Whoa, there's some kind of shield around\nMs. Katayama!
It seems like she's trying to build up her\nwrath while the shield is up...
Then we need to destroy that shield first!
Now let me see you stampede your students!
No... No, no...! AAAAAAGH!
I'll never hurt my students... Never!
Analysis... complete!
Everyone, look at the eyes on those wings!\nThey're absorbing power from the cable!
Eyes!? Oh, I see! If those are absorbing the\nenergy, then...!
Got it!
That's one down!
It's just as Wind suspected. Katayama's power\nis weakening. But...
It's still not enough. We can't let this\ndrag on too long.
Then let's finish this up quick, then!
That's the connection point for the cable.\nThis is our opening!
Time to finish this!
Ms. Katayama... I'm going to set you free!
Tch, you're utterly useless! That person's\npower turned out to be a disappointment, too...
That bastard!
Sensei! Can you hear me!? Sensei!
What's happening to her, Cattle!?
Ah... I think she'll be fine.
That strange power which transformed her is\ngone, and she's no longer in a frenzy.
If her Shadow disappears, it should return\nto the real Katayama.
Really? She'll be okay, right!?
Yes. Things could've been much worse if not\nfor Wonder and Wind's quick thinking.
But as it stands, the real Katayama won't\nsuffer any ill repercussions.
Everyone... I'm sorry...for everything...
You deserve...a better teacher...
That's not true!
You're a wonderful teacher who protects all\nof her students, including me!
Thank you... I'm going to be better from\nnow on.
I promise to return to school... and to you,\nmy precious students.
Sensei...
So this is Ms. Katayama's Treasure...
Damn it. Katayama-san tried to hand it over\nherself too.
If Akashi hadn't shown up, we wouldn't have\nhad to fight her!
Yeah! And if we'd made even the tiniest\nmistake, she could've died!
And that coward Akashi... Controlling her\nwhile hiding himself away! I'll never\nforgive him!
Huh? Uh... What just happened?
With Katayama's Shadow gone, the dam must\nbe low on power.
That explains the outage. Anyway, let's head\nafter Aka-shit.
Warning. Dam energy supply depleted.
Initiating emergency protocol. All doors\nwill be locked in ten minutes.
Whoa, whoa, what!?
All the doors... will lock in ten minutes?
Oh! Akashi's Shadow is weak and can only\nfeed off other Shadows!
Until he finds a new host to exploit, he\nplans to keep the Palace on lockdown!
In other words, until Akashi finds another\nvictim to fill Ms. Katayama's place...
We won't be able to enter the Palace or\nsteal Akashi's Treasure?
What!? Then we gotta steal his Treasure\nright now!
Yeah! We have to change Akashi's heart\nbefore more people get hurt!
Calm down. That will be impossible to do in\nonly ten minutes.
Akashi is crafty, and he's already wary\nof us. If we chase him blindly, we might\nend up walking into a trap.
Besides, if we don't escape now, we'll be\ntrapped in this Palace forever.
Damn...!
That fuckin' scumbag! Way to bring\nchickenshit to a new level!
Should we at least bring back Sensei's\nTreasure?
No, let's leave it here for now.
Huh? Why!?
Without her Treasure inside, the Palace\nmay start to collapse.
And if that happens, we won't be able to\nsteal Akashi's Treasure.
Yes... You're right. I know it's frustrating,\nbut let's retreat for now.
Cattle, if you don't mind.
Sensei... I promise we'll come back for\nyour Treasure!
Thank god. We managed to make it back\nsomehow.
Damn that bastard Akashi!
We had no choice. If we had allowed ourselves\nto be trapped there...
Any chance to change Akashi's heart would\nhave been lost, and he would be left to\nroam free forever.
Besides, it seems Katayama's Shadow has\nfound a new lease on life.
It's not quite a change of heart, but Akashi\ncan no longer steal her desire.
That's true. Then shall we switch gears?
Our next objective is to secure a route\nto Akashi's Treasure, but...
It will be no easy task since the doors are\nlocked and he's hypervigilant of intruders.
Then what do we do?
Hoom... If Akashi finds a new power source,\nthe Palace's security might ease up.
But by "power source," you mean...
A human, whose negative emotions Akashi\ncan exploit just like Katayama.
There's no way we're waiting for another\nperson to fall victim just so we can\nraid the Palace!
The whole point of changing his heart is so\nno one else gets hurt!
I agree it's putting the cart before the\nhorse... but how are we to siege a\nsealed Palace?
The next victim, huh?
We have... multiple options.
Huh? Riko-senpai?
Leader, may I handle this matter?
I have an idea and would like time to\ndevise a strategy.
Yes. This time...
...we'll lure Akashi into a trap.
What is it? Is something on your mind?
You must be exhausted from today. I suggest\nwe turn in early.
Yes... I agree today's mission left much to\nbe desired.
Still, Katayama's Shadow left the Palace,\nand the real Katayama was saved.
We will have another chance. For now, your\nnext mission is to steal yourself some sleep.
You're clearly crestfallen, but worry not.
Riko said she'll devise a strategy to deal\nwith Akashi, did she not?
For now, let's have faith in her and simply\ndo what we can.
Yes, there is lots to do outside the Palace,\nsuch as readying equipment and honing\nour skills.
Leave the strategizing to Riko and let us\njust do what we can.
Hoohoom, if you keep looking so defeated,\nRiko may have to take your place as leader.
I jest. By my personal estimation, you are\nthe only one for the job.
Let's eat.
After all, we've come this far without\nincident.
It may be obvious to me, but you should\nknow, not just anyone could manage that.\nHold your head high.
Yes, that's the spirit. We have the utmost\nfaith in you, leader.
If that's settled, let us hurry to bed.\nWe'll want to be sharp for tomorrow!
Huh? Wasn't the entrance to Akashi's Palace\nlocked? Why is it wide open?
He didn't find a new "power source"...\ndid he?
If someone has become the new energy source,\nthey're most likely at the "power plant"...
The same place where we left Ms. Katayama's\nTreasure. We should go make sure it's\nall right.
What the\u2014!? It's locked?
Okay.
Shhh! Someone's coming. Hide.
There's nothin' to do with the plant shut\ndown, but it's nice havin' some downtime.
Well, it's hardly a plant without a power\nsource like that teacher lady.
Let's kick back while we can. Things will\nget busy once it starts back up.
You're right. Akashi-sama hasn't even come\nout here since holing himself up on the\nother side of the plant.
While the cat is away, the mice will play!
It doesn't seem like he's caught a new\npower source yet.
So Akashi's hidin' up ahead, huh?\nThat little chickenshit!
It will be difficult to search as long as\nthe power plant is on lockdown.
Our only option is to return to the real\nworld and find a way to unlock the plant\nfrom there.
Yes, please leave that to me.
Whether we stay or head back to the real\nworld is up to you, Leader.
Come now, enough nonsense...\nSeriously, you lot...
Whoa... They've even got maids here!?
Huh, why!?
Freeze!
Someone's here!
H-Hey, that's...!
There! Take care of him!
What the...
Take 'em down, Joker!
Be careful!
Something weird's going on...
Look out!
NB[Di][468]
What was that...?
What a strange dream... I was\nwearing a mask, fighting this\nguy who looked like a thief...
For some reason, I woke up\nin a cold sweat...
Guess I should head to school.
Ah, it flew away.
I have to write my name...
I wrote down {PLAYER_NAME}\non the paper.
I'm suddenly feeling sleepy...
The... Velvet Room...?
Future plans...
I'm struggling to gather\nmy thoughts...
I need to get to the first\nfloor, but they seem deep\nin conversation...
They're too into their\nconversation to notice me...
I should ask them to let me\npass through...
For some reason, I feel my\nresolve to get past\nthem fading...
My own... free will...
Somehow, I can't find the will to do either...
That's... the girl\nfrom before...
Something is very, very wrong.
I feel an air of dread...\nSomething terribly disturbing.
The world itself feels...\nwrong, somehow...
But the feeling...\ngradually subsides...
That girl... There's nothing\nI can do to save her...
My head is throbbing...\nI just want to go home...
Hey, look out!
Whoa, that's seriously dangerous!
What just happened?
Where am I?
Wait, I was on the train...\nThen a bike...
I'm not entirely sure what's\ngoing on, but it seems I don't\nhave any other options...
He's right... I feel like\nsomething deep within my heart\nis slowly fading away...
No more.
I'll reclaim what's mine!
...And thou art I!
Persona...\nMementos... Shadows...?
My head is still spinning...\nbut I should follow Lufel\nfor now...
My body is starting to\nfeel exhausted...
"Them"? Is Lufel looking\nfor someone here...?
I'm in... Shibuya...?
I'm back in my\nregular clothes too...
Like Lufel said,\nI'm pretty exhausted...
I should get home...
Finally time to rest...
It's late. Time to go home.
Let's think about this...
The bell rang... Morning\nclasses are over.
Merope is here.
I should try using the Incubus\nI just got.
It's not ready yet...
Something feels different...
This could be a good time to\ntry switching Personas with\nthe power of the wild card...
Some baseball shoes are\non display...
They seem pretty sturdy...
A baseball glove\nand uniform...
A baseball glove is on\ndisplay here...
A baseball glove...
This doesn't look like a\npitcher's emblem...
It's already running...
There's nothing here...
I should look carefully...
I've got a bad feeling about\nthis foe. I don't think we're\nstrong enough to face it...
I feel like there's something\nI forgot to do...
We'll need to\ninvestigate this\narea carefully...
Aside from the mark on the\ndoor, there could be other\nclues nearby...
Yet another mechanism... There may be a hint\nsomewhere on the floor.
Nothing happened...\nSeems we got the\norder wrong.
No response... Guess we'll\njust have to find another way.
That mark isn't\nglowing anymore...
The door is locked.\nI should see if there's\na key around here...
She thrust the TOS along\nwith other important-looking\ndocuments into my hands.
We should probably train a bit\nmore before we try\ntaking them on...
What was that just now...?
I feel something on\nmy forehead...
Spending time with Lufel,\nI feel hope rising within me...
I feel my bond with Lufel\ngrowing deeper...
A base for nurturing hope...?
Come to think of it, wasn't I\ntold to nurture desire to\navoid ruin?
If I don't hurry, I'll be\nlate for school. Better\nget dressed.
Better head to school...
My parents are leaving for\ntheir trip overseas today and\nwon't be back for a while...
Now that I think of it, Lufel\nmust've come in through the\nopen window. I should shut it...
I better to hurry to school...
Is that... Merope?
What's she doing here...?
What the heck was that...?
I looked around the platform,\nbut she's nowhere to be seen...
It's got her train pass\ninside, and a baseball and\ncatcher's mitt keychain on it...
Maybe she headed for\nthe ticket gate...
Glad I was able to get it back to her.
Come to think of it, I was\nable to help her without that\nstrange feeling from before...
The "Persona" that Lufel\nmentioned... That power\nhelped me reclaim my desires...?
Magatsukami...
For some reason, I'm getting\na bad feeling about this...
Wait, that app...
Looks like Lufel wants to\nmeet on the roof...
I told her I plan to eat on\nthe roof today.
I should head to the roof...
That miso smells\nreally good...
Now, where's Lufel...?
Are people's desires being\nstolen because someone's Shadow\nhas gone berserk...?
Mementos? Shadows?
What did he mean by stealing\nback what was taken? And what\nthe heck is a Phantom Thief?
Oh yeah, I still\nhaven't eaten yet...
Lunch break's about to end...\nI should hurry to the\nschool store!
I seem different than before?
I do feel more determined...\nProbably since my desires\naren't being stolen anymore.
Guess that means no lunch\nfor me...
Lufel said I should meet him\nin Shibuya...
Kiuchi hit that woman with\nthe baby, and she...
If I turn away now and pretend this never happened...
...something horrific will\nlikely come to pass.
-J\xe1no\u0161\xedk!\n-Ars\xe8ne!
I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...
I'm back in my\nregular clothes...
Spending time with Merope,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
So even if I don't recognize\nthem, these people will\nmaterialize as my allies...?
That reminds me...
I feel someone staring at me...
There's an announcement on\nthe Divine Justice site...
There's one in my\nrecommendations...
He kinda steamrolled me\ninto it, but...
Looks like Lufel's gonna live\nhere with me...
He sleeps standing up...
I should get to bed too...
I feel something pecking\nat my forehead....
Time's ticking, I better head\nto the meeting spot \nat the station...
What just happened!?
Noge-san's dream...
It's after school. Let's\nhead to Shibuya Station...
She's in danger...!
The Shadow... it was drawn\nto me and... wanted to become\npart of me?
It was even able to recall\nits name that it had\nforgotten...
Deep down, I feel like\nI somehow recognize\nits presence...
To Lufel, it looked like I was\njust standing there...
Can other people not see\nthat door?
What the heck is that?
A flyer...?
What's going on!?
"Sir Takeyuki Kiuchi, former baseball player..." Huh?
The Phantom Thieves...
Ridiculous!
Whatever that was... I feel \nlike I've seen it before...\nmany times...
What the heck is going on?
Descent into ruin...?
Nurturing desire with other\nallies of hope...
Does that mean\nthe Phantom Thieves?
Soup got in my eye!
By deciding to continue with\nthe Phantom Thieves...
Mom's messaging me...
Seems like Mom and Dad\nare enjoying their trip...
I really have to get\nto school soon...
Takemi Medical Clinic\nin Yongen-Jaya...
Maybe I should go check it out\nafter school.
Dialog-3700000~5000000_Dialog.csv_content_3894658
Dialog-3700000~5000000_Dialog.csv_content_3894659
My joints...\nI think I'm broken...
I managed to drag myself\nto the locker room and\nreturn to class...
Motoha sent me the location\nfor Takemi Medical Clinic.
My app's also displaying an\nunfamiliar screen...
Motoha's calling me...
Dialog-3700000~5000000_Dialog.csv_content_3895286
Dialog-3700000~5000000_Dialog.csv_content_3895290
The three of us enjoyed\na delicious meal...
We exchanged numbers\nwith Yamagoshi...
Lufel seems very interested\nin getting to know me.
I feel my bond with Lufel has\ngrown deeper...
Kano seems really determined.\nI can't see any way of\nconvincing him...
Dialog-3700000~5000000_Dialog.csv_content_3896067
Something much worse...
This again...
It's like I saw an image\nof the future...
Kano said that Miyazawa \n"threw out the soul\nof Victory Kitchen"...
The soul of Victory Kitchen...\nIf anyone knew what that\nmeant, it'd be him!
I put the phone\non speaker mode...
So that's why he said that...
We ended up in our\nthief suits somehow...!
(Temp)
I'm pierced by everyone's\nexpectant gazes...
A Phantom Thief logo...\nI wonder what kind of design\nwould be good...
Well, I feel like I've got a\ngood idea of what to draw now!
Wrong...?
What the heck was that\njust now...
No, not just now, but\nover and over again...
Is there something\nI'm forgetting...?
I can sense Lufel's faith\nin me...
My eyelids are starting\nto get heavy...
I ate Motoha's\nrolled omelet...
It's delicious, but there's a\nbig eggshell in it...
I should get to school...
I'm kind of nervous,\nbut I think I want to try them.
It's the website for\nDivine Justice...
A notice saying Ms. Katayama's\nbeen suspended is posted on\nthe bulletin board.
We've agreed to start working\nwith Riko Tanemura...
Come to think of it...
It feels like we're all\nto blame...
I felt eyes on us just now...
I had that vision of Katayama\nunconscious in the hospital\non the verge of death...
"All because that power was\nsent into her..."
He seems like a gallant and courageous\nfigure.
Hoo, time flew by quicker than I expected.\nHow far did you manage to get?
Looks like you still have some pages left to\nread. You should continue from this point\nnext time.
Although J\xe1no\u0161\xedk was branded a villain, he\nnever took lives or succumbed to greed.
Oh, did you finish reading "The Chivalrous\nJ\xe1no\u0161\xedk"?
The leader of a band of thieves who only\nsteals from the wicked, hm? He looks rather\ndignified.
Nothing is more satisfying than enjoying a\ngood book, hm? If you have time, you should\nread another.
This was Rob Roy's way of life... It's quite\nmoving.
"Pride" seemed to be the driving motivation\nbehind Rob Roy's actions...
Did you finish reading "Scarlet Pride"?
The heroic tale of Rob Roy, who cleared his\nname and retook everything stolen from him.
From a princess to a pirate... Refusing her\narranged marriage shows her dedication to\nher own desires.
She ended up marrying the same man she had\nbeen betrothed to from the very beginning.\nAn ironic twist of fate.
Did you finish reading "Queen of the Seas"?
Awilda's arranged marriage partner's bravery\neventually won her heart after all.
A horse merchant turned outlaw? This story\nseems familiar, somehow.
"Nearly nothing", but not for free... Well,\nhe was still a merchant after all.
Did you finish reading "Smuggler on\nHorseback"?
Mandrin became an outlaw for revenge, but\nnever forgot his tradesman background...
The legendary kunoichi, eh? Supposedly she\nconducted espionage actions all across the\ncountry.
I see... Priests and shrine maidens are\nconsidered trustworthy, so it was an ideal\nmethod to gather information...
Did you finish reading "The Kunoichi's Path"?
A shrine maiden and a ninja... They were two\nsides of the same coin, as it turned out.
A true gentleman thief, eh? Just as we\nourselves strive to be!
He would steal from the wealthy, and always\nlended a hand to the weak. That is the true\nessence of a noble thief.
Did you finish reading "Brigante Buono"?
The reason by gentleman thieves are esteemed\nby the public is because of their dedication\nto their noble ideals.
By studying their mentality and aesthetic\nsense yourself, you can also develop your\ncharm as a Phantom Thief.
That's not surprising. In those days, the\ndistinction between a doctor and a magician\nwas unclear.
Such a frustrating display of injustice...\nIt makes you realize how difficult it was to\nfight against the prejudices of the era.
Did you finish reading "The Witch's Kiss"?
Battling prejudice and seeking\nunderstanding... Those things are still\nrelevant in the modern era.
An arranged marriage? That sort of thing\nis rare nowadays. Seems like a bit of\nan anachronism, if you ask me.
Ah, just like it said in the title. Quite a\nperfect happy ending, wasn't it? Not a single\nloose end.
Did you finish reading "Rosina's Engagement"?
I expected a typical tiresome love triangle,\nbut she ended up becoming best friends with\nher beloved's ex-fiance...
The writing style is much simpler than I\nexpected. This is quite easy for anyone\nto grasp.
"Castling" appears to be a special technique\nthat allows you to swap the positions of your\nking and rook. Interesting.
Did you finish reading "Forest on the Board"?
It was fascinating to read the tactical\nexchanges as the protagonist anticipated his\nopponent's moves and outwitted them.
A strategic approach could prove useful for\nthe Phantom Thieves as well, don't you agree?
So they're doing dance practice on the\nslippery rocks by the sea, but is that really\na good idea?
Ironic, isn't it? Her sworn enemy is the one\nwho admires her skill more than anyone else.
Did you finish reading\n"Dance of Vengeance"?
The tale of revenge was interesting enough,\nbut the descriptions of the heroine's dancing\nwere exquisite.
Just reading it might make your feet start\nmoving of their own accord. Didn't you feel\nthe same?
So he injured his shoulder during the\nchampionship game, and on top of that, he\nlost. This pitcher truly is unfortunate.
I never would have expected that! He\nmastered underthrow pitching, and continued\nplaying despite his injury.
Did you finish reading\n"Grasping Victory"?
The way those baseball players stood up\nagainst adversity... I think the Phantom\nThieves could learn something from that.
The author doesn't provide very much insight\ninto his thought process... But perhaps\nwe should be thankful for that.
There's no substance at all to this! It's\nnothing but cheap self-promotion.
Did you finish reading\n"Charisma 101"?
Perhaps charisma has nothing to do with\nsubstance at all... It's all about\npresentation.
Well, you've got plenty of both style and\nsubstance. Just need to learn how to show it!
So a physicist is helping cover up a crime?\nI suppose human emotions are\nnot always rational.
He was willing to sacrifice himself\nfor love... But even so, the one he loved\ncould not be saved.
Did you finish reading\n"Suspect Y's Sacrifice"?
The human drama of this story ended up\nleaving more of an impression than\nthe mystery itself.
An interesting pose, but this name has me\nbaffled. What does this have to do with\nbeing a warrior?
Again with these names.. It seems far too\ngrandiose for what you're doing!
Did you finish reading\n"Comprehensive Yoga"?
You read the whole book, but I never saw\nyou actually attempt any of the poses...
Oh well. I'm sure you're feeling a bit more\nlimber and dextrous just from reading\nabout it, right?
Hoomph, I see! Excessive wealth can actually\nhave a negative effect on one's desires,\nit seems.
That's rather spot-on! This author is far\nmore insightful than the average person.
Did you finish reading\n"Apathy in the Modern Age"?
People may think it sounds good to live\nfree from desire, but that can hardly be\ncalled "living."
She was pushed into a corner, and ended up\nawakening to a supernatural power... That\nmust sound familiar, right?
Her tenacity is quite fearsome. She's\ndetermined not to let anyone\ndefeat her.
Did you finish reading\n"Mirika the Witch"?
It was much more intense than I expected...\nBoth physically and psychologically. Hoo.
There is a letter in between each chapter\nof the novel. What an interesting\nstorytelling method.
Perhaps this new relationship will help\nhim through his grief..
Did you finish reading\n"Weaving Fate"?
That was a very moving story. Although\na few parts were a bit heavy-handed.
You seem to be feeling the protagonist's\nkindness too. I can see it on your face.
Is this some kind of... chant? Or maybe one\nof those rap songs? This sentence alone\nis a failure.
It's trying to say that imagining success\nleads to real results... I think.
Did you finish reading\n"What It Means to Fail"?
The rhyming style of writing was annoying\nat first, but I don't think I'll ever forget\nthose mantras...
Quite an archetypal fairy-tale image.\nJust reading about it paints a vivid picture.
Ah, yes, I can hear it now: un, deux, trois,\nun, deux, trois! Hoohoo.
Did you finish reading\n"The Castle of Frost"?
Every scene was painted with a masterful\naesthetic sense... Not bad, don't you think?
An elementary school story, hm? The writing\nstyle is simple to understand, but I think\nadults can get something out of it too.
It seems the story was based on the author's\ntrue experiences. It could almost be\nconsidered non-fiction.
Did you finish reading\n"By the Window"?
It's an older work, but the story still\nresonates today. The innocence of children\nis always touching.
It's good to revisit your childhood and\nremember those simpler, kinder days,\nisn't it?
A story from a dog's point of view...\nHow interesting! Perhaps I should also..\nNo, nevermind.
He's rather harsh for a dog... You could\nsay I'm quite kind in comparison. Aren't\nyou grateful?
Did you finish reading\n"I Am a Dog"?
Dogs must live alongside human society.\nYou could say that requires more tact\nand skill than humans.
Inokashira Park, hm... Even outside of\ncherry blossom season, it's a beautiful\nplace to enjoy nature year-round.
I do love to get out and stretch my wings...\nAnd I mean that literally, of course! Hoohoo.
Perhaps you should consider inviting\nsomeone out for a leisurely stroll in\nthe park.
Did you finish reading\n"Top-Secret Sakura Spots"?
If you get tired of life in the city, it may\nbe good to get some fresh air.
It says it's the tallest radio broadcast\ntower in Japan. The view from the top\nmust be spectacular.
Even for a magnificent raptor such as\nyours truly, flying up to 634 meters is\nout of the question...
I suppose I'll just take the elevator\nalong with you and your companions.
Did you finish reading\n"All about Skytree"?
It seems to be a popular date spot as well.\nIs there anyone you'd like to invite there?
Annual contemporary art exhibitions,\npublic galleries, and a variety of\nunique displays...
I'd like to see it myself!
This art museum has quite a fine\natmosphere... Perhaps you should invite\nsomeone to go with you!
Did you finish reading\n"The World of Art"?
Try to think of who you'd like to invite\nto Ueno. I await your first foray into the\nworld of art!
Hoo, a planetarium? I had no idea such a\nthing existed in Ikebukuro.
It's not easy to see the real stars in\na city such as this. I can see the appeal\nin this venue.
By the way, does it mention anything about\nan owl constellation? No? Are you sure?\nLook again. Surely there must be one!
Did you finish reading\n"Science Savvy: Stars"?
It might make for a romantic date spot, hm?\nOf course, a friendly outing would be fun\nas well.
Ah, so different countries use their own\ncategorization methods, hm? For example,\npsychology books would be... Hoohoo.
Did you finish reading\n"Secret Librarian Skills"?
The sorting methods in this book should\nprove useful when you work at the bookstore.
That's a valid point. Although I'd prefer it\nto actually taste delicious as well.
Did you finish reading\n"Delectable Desserts!"?
I imagine this book's techniques will\ncome in handy when you work at\nthe cr\xeape shop.
Flower symbolism truly is like another\nlanguage... Humans think of all sorts of\nthings! But how did they decide on these?
Did you finish reading\n"The Language of Flowers"?
Now that you've read this, you should be able\nto put the knowledge to good use when you\nwork at the flower shop.
There's a diverse range of tastes these days,\nso choosing the right gift for the right\nperson is complicated.
Did you finish reading\n"Choosing the Right Gift"?
The things you learned from this book will\nprobably be useful when you work at\nthe accessory shop.
It's unusual to find a book that's only\nabout ingredients. There don't seem to\nbe any recipes.
Did you finish reading\n"The Ingredients Spoketh"?
I think the information in that book will\nhelp you when you work at the\nChinese restaurant.
Hm. It's originally a French word, it seems.\nIt roughly translates to "assembly."
Did you finish reading\n"Analysis of Film"?
It seems you've gained some behind-the-scenes\nknowledge of filmmaking and composition.
Reading this book should help you appreciate\nmovies more in the future.
This book even seems to be waterproof.\nPerhaps you should take it with you to\nthe bathhouse?
Did you finish reading\n"Quick Relaxation Methods"?
You've got a lot on your plate, between going\nto school and being a Phantom Thief. Be sure\nyou get some time to rest.
If you use the techniques from this book,\nyour baths should be even more refreshing.
Making your pecs... dance? Well, to each\ntheir own, I suppose.
Did you finish reading\n"MUSCLES!"?
In the phantom thief business, your body is\nan important asset. Best to keep up with\nyour training.
This book's techniques should help you\nget more out of your training from now on.
Is that true? Well, from a business\nperspective, you wouldn't want your featured\nitem to sell out quickly...
Did you finish reading\n"Encapsulated Mysteries"?
Not knowing what you'll receive only makes\nyou want to spin it more... These capsule\nmachines are the embodiment of desire.
Understanding the system a bit more should\nhelp you enjoy capsule machines even more\nin the future.
When we're in Mementos, you can use your\nPersona's power to heal your wounds, but\nthat's not possible in reality.
Did you finish reading\n"All about First Aid"?
This book should help you out when you\nwork at the drugstore.
It seems like "service with a smile" is\nrequested in many other jobs besides\nburger establishments.
Did you finish reading\n"Fast Food Finesse"?
You should be able to make use of these tips\nwhen you work at the beef bowl shop.
Flattery can get you pretty far after all.\nBoth with customers and your boss.
Did you finish reading\n"Convenience Store Clout"?
Learning these techniques should help you\nwith your job at the convenience store.
Oh, so the creator of kabuki was a woman?\nBut later, women were strictly banned from\nperforming it... Interesting.
Taking on different roles... You could say\nit's similar to the power of Persona, no?
So kabuki has continued evolving to\nentertain modern audiences. That sort of\ndesire is worthy of praise.
Did you finish reading\n"The Art of Kabuki"?
Men playing women's roles, presenting\nidealized visions of desire... That truly is\nthe pinnacle of beauty and skill.
Well, you don't have to go quite that far...\nBut surely your understanding of how to\ncharm others has expanded.
Perhaps such a broad mindset is a perk only\nattainable with a prince's privileges.
Such a thing was permitted under the\nancient system of polygamy. Hoohoo, are you\nperhaps feeling jealous?
This dastard goes around adopting widows\nlike they're stray dogs.
Did you finish reading\n"Keiun Chronicles"?
I'm not exactly sure this prince's actions\nwere truly motivated by kindness...
Firing laser beams from the eyes... Is that\nactually a form of ninjutsu? It seems\ndisrespectful to call it so.
It's certainly not what I was expecting...\nBut these weapon designs are quite inventive.
A climactic final scene... But the combination\nmechanism strains believability, even for\na story like this.
Did you finish reading\n"Cyber Ninjutsu Scrolls"?
I must say, it exceeded my expectations.\nThe descriptions of the cyber mechanisms\nwere quite interesting!
Aren't you feeling more proficient after\nreading that? Unfortunately, I can't craft\nany cyber-gadgets with these wings...
So humans eat more than the required amount\nto survive, as a method of managing stress...\nI can sense the distortions of desire.
In today's overly-complicated society,\nsatisfying desires is no simple matter.
No matter the era, human desires will never\nbe satisfied... Which leads some people to\ngive up on them altogether.
Did you finish reading\n"Starvation of the Mind"?
This book seems extremely relevant to\nthe problems we're fighting against.
A lone swordsman, standing up against\noverwhelming adversity... This is the\nessence of bushido.
He can face any challenge with nothing but\nhis lone blade. It'd be nice to have him on\nthe Phantom Thieves, hm?
Even after wandering as a ronin, he never\nlost sight of his devotion to his former\nlord... Magnificent.
Did you finish reading\n"Legend of the Ronin"?
These historical epics are very interesting.\nThere's a certain mentality that's missing\nfrom modern drama...
Hmm, so this is what's fashionable in the\ncurrent era... I see.
Military... So they wear camouflage patterns?\nI myself can adeptly camouflage as a\ntree branch, you know.
Did you finish reading\n"Menswear Monthly"?
As a phantom thief, your sense of style\nis critically important.
You don't want to stand out too much,\nof course, but you should take care in your\nappearance nonetheless.
It's a special effects action hero show. The\nwriting and drama have a surprisingly mature\nCharm, though. Or so I've heard.
It was a sequel to a popular series, but it\nsounds like there was a lot of difficulty on\nthe production side...
Did you finish reading\n"Featherman: A Corpus"?
Don't underestimate it just because it's\na superhero show. It's getting a lot of adult\nfans these days.
So their entire school was cast into a\ndemonic realm... That sounds like an even\nmore dangerous situation than ours.
They're finally battling against the root\ncause of it all... I'm on the edge of\nmy seat!
Did you finish reading\n"Devil School Summoners"?
The part where they armed themselves\nwith school club equipment was quite\nexciting, and realistic.
"Your soul belongs to God,\nbut your riches are mine\nto take."
"All of the wealth he had\nstolen, he would distribute\namongst the poor."
"Honor is that which no man\ncan give you, and no man can\ntake away."
"It goes against my pride to\nignore the suffering of\nmy comrades."
"Who my lifelong partner shall\nbe is for me alone to decide!"
"Awilda was impressed by the\ncrown prince's bravery..."
"He vowed he would take\nrevenge against the unjust\ntax collectors..."
"He would sell back his\nsmuggled goods to the public\nfor nearly nothing..."
"Chiyome Mochizuki organized a\nband of female ninja..."
"By Takeda Shingen's orders,\nChiyome disguised herself as\na shrine maiden..."

Huh? Oh, right. They did say that was today.
This is your room.
I'll at least give you sheets for your bed.
We'll be going to Shujin tomorrow.
It's Shujin Academy.
We'll introduce ourselves properly to the staff there.
Consider yourself lucky. There aren't many places
that would take a kid like you.
Yes, sir.
Huh? I thought I deleted this.
Welcome to my Velvet Room.
I am Igor, the master of this place.
Our paths shall soon cross again.
For now, you'd best return to your own world.
Should you cause any trouble, you'll be expelled immediately.
Honestly, I hesitated on accepting someone\nlike you...
But there were some circumstances on our side...
I'm Sadayo Kawakami.
Come to the faculty office when you arrive at school tomorrow.
I'll show you to the classroom.
Sakura-san, you keep a close eye on him, all right?
Don't let him cause any trouble outside...
Oh? You need a ride, too?
Ah... No...
That so? Okay...
Friggin' Kamoshida.
Kamoshida?
The guy in the car.
That was Kamoshida.
He does whatever the hell he wants...
Crap! We're cutting it close.
The rain ain't that bad.
We better hurry up, or we'll be late.
What the hell...?
Where the heck did the school go!?
What're you just standing there for?
I'm going in.
Huh? But...
The hell is all this?
We gotta run!
Oww!
I think I broke somethin'!
Quit screwing with us, dammit!
Let us outta here!
Hey! I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
No one has free reign in my castle.
Kamoshida!?
Execute them!
Open the gate!
Run!
These guys ain't messin' around!
I don't wanna die...
What's the matter?
Thou who art willing to perform
all sacrilegious acts for thine own justice!
Call upon my name, and release thy rage!
Show the strength of thy will to ascertain all on thine own...
though thou be chained to Hell itself!
Come to me!
Ars\xe8ne!
No way...
You have returned Home.
Welcome back.
Returned?
Does that mean we got away?
Who knows?
Whoa, we're really back!
The castle's gone!
What's this about a "castle"?
Welcome to Shujin Academy!
Good luck trying to enjoy your new school life.
I'd like to introduce a transfer student...
Ren Amamiya.
Today
he wasn't feeling well, so he got here late.
...Nice to meet you.
Let's see, let's sit you...
...over there.
So we gotta fight
or die trying.
Let's go.
For real?
The gymnasium...?
I know that guy.
He's on the volleyball team.
So the rumors were right...
They say Kamoshida uses corporal punishment.
He takes out his anger on the team by hurting them.
Stop! Please!
This castle is seriously messed up!
Whatever, we need to save them!
Gimme a hand!
Ngh! Ngh\u2014!
Ha! Nothing but a pair of amateurs...
All right, listen up.
I'm talking to you, Blondie and Frizzy Hair!
Those people over there aren't real humans.
They're puppets that only exist in this Palace.
Fake humans, if you will.
You got that?
That was helpful, right?
Right?
Right!?
If so
then get me outta here!
What the hell!? Is that a cat?
Monster caaaaat!
I am NOT a cat!
My name's Morgana!
C'mon, let's make a deal.
See that key over there?
All you gotta do is free me.
And if you do
I'll teach you all there is to know about this Palace.
Aren't you curious?
...Deal.
Th-This ain't my fault!
Once these two are dealt with,
you're next, you hear?
Are you going to let him talk to you like that?
He needs knocking down a peg.
Let's take back what he took from you.
You made me wait quite a while.
You seek power, correct?
Then let us form a pact.
The skull of rebellion is your flag henceforth!
Ngh... Gah...
Aahhh!!
Right on... Wassup, Persona...
This effin' rocks!
Now that I got this power...
...it's time for payback, you bastard!
Let's go, Captain Kidd!
Show them your might...
Zorro!
Hmph.
Buncha amateurs...
You've got one, too!?
Now!
Let's wipe them out in one fell swoop!
After me, newbies!
I hereby sentence you three to death!
Let's retreat for now!
Right!
A wise decision, newbie.
Let's go!
Takamakiiiii!
Filthy trespassers...
Dammit!
Kamoshida, you bastard!
You're gonna pay for this!
All right, dig in.
Tonight's on me, dude.
Speaking of which, I haven't even introduced myself yet.
The name's Ryuji Sakamoto,
but you can call me Ryuji,
Renren.
Nice to meet you,
Sakamoto.
Ah! Come on!
That voice...
Morgana!?
Why're you\u2014
Wait, so you ARE a cat!?
A talking cat!?
This is just the form I took when I came to this world.
I have a proposal for you two.
By using the Palace
you can change Kamoshida's heart.
For real!?
With my help, yes.
I suppose I could guide you through it.
But how thou\u2014
Shut up and listen!
This is the important part.
Attempting a change of heart is dangerous.
Worst case scenario, it could kill Kamoshida.
Is that a risk you're willing to take?
Can't give an immediate answer, huh?
Take some time to think it over.
I look forward to your response.
So...
In general terms...
a "premeditated crime" is...
What do ya think? About what Monamona said?
I'm curious, but...
Yeah, the whole "could kill him" part...
Don't get me wrong, I hate the guy
but it's not like I wanna kill him, ya know?
Of course not.
There's gotta be another way.
Hey, that's\u2014!
Whoa. Is she actually...?
Huh? Is that Suzui from the volleyball team?
Everyone, settle down!
Stay seated!
Hey! Where are you going!?
Return to your seats at once!
Shiho!
I... I can't take this... anymore...
Ann...
Hey! Shiho!
Someone should go with her...
Are there any teachers around?
I-I'm not in charge of her class though...
We should leave this to Principal Kobayakawa...
I'll go!
Okay, let's go.
The hell are those two up to?
Huh? THIS is the Treasure?
Nope. All we're doing today is securing our infiltration route.
To steal the Treasure, we have to let it manifest first.
Sounds like we're not the only intruders.
I knew security was a little thin...
That explains it.
Another intruder?
What happened to the school?
Is this a movie set or something?
Prepare to be executed!
Are you kidding me?
Cut it out, you pervert!
That voice... Sakamoto!?
And you're... the transfer student?
Are you just going to give in?
We've got a score to settle.
For Suzui-san's sake.
She's your friend, right? Your one and only!
Mm...
Good grief... Took you long enough.
Who is going to avenge her,
if you don't take a stand here?
Thou art I...
Takamaki has a Persona, too!?
Ah...!
How dare you! Enough of your insolence!
No, I've had enough of you!
No one's gonna stop me now!
Let's do this, everyone!
You're going down in style!
Every rose has its thorns!
Th-This can't be happening!
Wait...!
Wh-What's with this suit?
Since when!?
Ooh!
D-Don't look!
We'll explain later!
Reinforcements are on their way!
Here... Gimme your arm.
You take the other side.
The Phantom Thieves of Hearts...?
That reaction from Kamoshida...
It's proof that our actions in the Palace had an effect.
How so?
You saw, didn't you?
The Treasure...
...It manifests when its owner feels threatened.
By sending the calling card
we should be able to steal it!
So once we steal his Treasure, Kamoshida will have a change of heart...
Right. Let's regroup later tonight.
We'll meet at midnight
in front of the school gates!
Finally... Our Phantom Thief debut.
Gotta admit, I'm kinda nervous.
We sent the calling card.
Failure is not an option.
That goes without saying.
Ready when you are!
Let's move.
I'm a cut above all other humans!
He's possessed by his twisted desires.
A true demon.
That's riiiiight!
I am the demon who rules this wooooorld!
Gold Medal...
Attaaaaack!
Persona!
Hrrrraaaaagh!
Go! Go! Kamoshi...da!
Not my crown!
Checkmate.
We did it... right?
Mr. Kamoshida...?
I have repeatedly done things that were unbecoming of a teacher.
Verbally abusing students...
Physically abusing my team...
And...
Sexually harassing female students...
The reason why Shiho Suzui-san tried to kill herself...
It's all because of me.
I am an arrogant, shallow...
and shameful person.
No, I'm worse than that!
I will take responsibility and kill myself for it!
Mr. Kamoshida! C-Calm down!
I\u2014
Don't run, you bastard!
Shiho, who jumped...
And everyone who turned a blind eye...
All of us...
...have to live in this reality and bear the burden of our regrets!
You have no right to run from this!
You're absolutely right...
I should be punished under the law...
And atone for my crimes...
I officially turn myself in!
Please call the police!
It's just like the calling card said...
Are the Phantom Thieves of Hearts legit?
That's all for today's assembly!
Return to your classes immediately!
I totally panicked when I saw the "Closed\nfor Cleaning" sign at the bathrooms...
Cus you ate too much.
What are you, a child?
Come on, Takamaki-san's waiting.
Let's hurry back.
Ngh... Ungh...
Have the car ready downstairs.
We'll return to party headquarters until our meeting
with the Minister of Infrastructure.
H-Hey!
The Chief Secretary...
What did he say?
To monitor the situation
and refrain from making a statement until public opinion has cooled.
What a coward...
Perfectly content with his seat in the cabinet. A complacent old fart.
Hey, baldy.
We were here first, ya know?
Have they started a day care here?
You're gone for one second and the clientele completely changes.
Huh!? Get back here!
Ugh... What the hell was his deal?
No clue.
Grumpy bastard...
Walking around like he owns the place.
So you're a regular here, Sae-san?
I wouldn't call her a regular.
So, what brings you in today?
I just like the coffee here.
Have we met somewhere before?
My name is Goro Akechi.
You have a nice place here.
It has a real je ne sais quoi.
Akechi...?
You know...
Detectives are such ambiguous creatures.
Wouldn't you agree?
Their value isn't self-evident through mere existence alone.
No, they need two things to become fully realized.
The first is a difficult case that only they can solve.
The second is a worthy opponent at its center.
Sorry to bore you. I tend to get carried away at times.
He's the Detective Prince everyone's talking about.
Who the hell are you?
And why are you following us?
Simply exquisite...
Go on, answer me!
I'm a second year at Kosei High School.
My name is Yusuke Kitagawa.
I'm an aspiring artist, so I live and train with the Japanese painter,
Ichiryusai Madarame, as his apprentice.
You are the woman I've been searching for all this time!
I beg of you. Be my\u2014!
Wait, seriously...?
H-Hold on a second!
We're in public!
Be my\u2014
Muse! The subject of my painting!
Madarame-sensei's exhibition will begin this weekend.
I'll be there to help out on opening day.
I can fill you in on the details then.
Yeah, not going. Art's not my thing.
I think I'll check it out...
Lady Ann, don't tell me you fell in love with Yusuke at first sight!?
No, no, nothing like that.
It's a free ticket, you know?
Plus, going to a solo-exhibit seems kinda classy.
Poser.
Shut it!
So the act of emptying one's mind gives rise to inner beauty.
That's Master Madarame for you!
"Master." A curious word that hardly bears meaning.
Takamaki-san!
You came!
Um... yeah.
You really came.
Is that a problem?
Make sure that you don't get in the way of the other visitors.
Shall we get going?
I'll serve as your guide.
We can discuss the painting I'd like you to model for, too.
Ah, okay...
Catch you guys later.
Oh! There it is!
The painting I wanted to see in person!
...This one?
You wanted to see this one?
It saw it on TV.
It left a huge impression on me.
Maybe it was the anger behind it?
I'm not sure,
but I sense this burning rage behind it.
Mr. Madarame has always seemed like such a calm person in interviews
but he can paint things like this, too.
There are much better paintings than this, you know.
So why did you call us here?
There's something that's been bothering me.
...Here, look at this.
The post sounds like it's about Madarame.
"Japanese Master Painter Plagiarizes His Apprentice's Work"...!?
Now, I know it's a bit sudden, but we have a favor to ask of you, Lady Ann.
Me?
Very well.
There's something I'd like to show you all.
The thing I wanted to show you...
...is this.
It's his debut work and magnum opus...
"Sayuri."
This is the painting that inspired me to become an artist.
When I first laid eyes on you, Takamaki-san,
I had the same feeling I got when I first saw this painting.
So I ask you once more...
Please consider being my model.
Forgive me,
but I must assist Sensei today.
We can continue this discussion at a later date.
Guess we were wrong, huh?
Let's get outta here.
It really is a "shack," huh?
Right? I was shocked.
Hm? What's up?
The Meta-Nav is reacting.
-Huh!?\n-No way!
Palace detected.
A Palace!?
How!?
..."Museum"?
Beginning navigation.
That's Master Madarame for ya!
"Plagiarism"? "Abuse"?
What's wrong with that?
I provide for my apprentices, and in return...
...they give me their art!
It's no different than an investment.
But lately all my apprentices
are quick to resist or flee.
All the more reason for me to break them in.
But the last one left is a true gem.
Yusuke has talent.
He also feels indebted to me.
He's mine to push around until I tire of\u2014no, until my dying breath!
Skull.
You saw something that looked like that locked door?
Yeah.
It resembled a door in that shack in the real world.
If I remember correctly, that door had an unusually large lock on it.
If we can open it
then maybe the Palace door will unlock, too.
But doing that won't be enough.
We'll also need to change Madarame's belief that the door is unopenable...
Meaning we'll need to open it right in front of him!
O-Okay...
I guess I'll get undressed, then.
Yes, please do.
You're going to embarrass me
if you keep staring at me like that!
Could you look the other way?
Will that help?
Hurry up!
What are you even doing!?
Sorry. I've almost got it...
Takamaki-san?
What do I even say!?
I'm home.
All right, it's open!
S-Sensei!?
Yusuke?
What are you doing there!?
It's...
It's not what it looks like!
This is the real "Sayuri"!
I thought it was stolen.
I've reported you to my private security company!
If you insist on making a fuss about this...
Yusuke!
I'll turn you in to the police!
Run for it, Lady Ann!
...Takamaki-san?
That means you two are...
Great, you're here too now?
What is this place?
Madarame!?
Sensei... is that you? That attire...
My usual ragged attire is nothing but an act.
Why would a famous person ever live in a shack?
I have another residence, obviously.
Why!?
Why did you forget the true meaning of art!?
What would you know about art!?
Talking down to me like you know best...
I'll shut you up here and now!
Your little rebellion is over!
Kitagawa-kun!
You're different from this riff raff.
My little moneymaker... A bona fide cash cow.
Did you really think I took you in out of the goodness\nof my heart? You, with no connections?
No, your talent was a ripe fruit just waiting to be plucked.
After taming you like livestock, I'll discard you\nas soon as you lose your value.
You idiot!
I truly was blind!
Have you finally come to your senses?
It is time you teach people which is which!
Come forth!
A breathtaking sight...
Imitations they may be,
but together, they make a fine spectacle...
Though the flowers of evil blossom, be it known...
Abominations are fated to perish!
You dare slander my art!? You ungrateful wretch!
I can now ascertain your true self without any reservations...
With Goemon by my side!
Ha! You truly are pathetic.
Madarame!
You shall forever rue the day
you dared defy me!
Under the guise of authority, you stole your apprentice's ideas
and went so far as to claim them as your own.
We have decided to make you confess\nall your crimes with your own mouth.
We will take your distorted desires without fail.
From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts!
What's the meaning of this!?
It kinda looks like a face...
THIS is the Treasure!?
Meddlesome vermin...
You've wreaked enough havoc in my museum.
That's...
Brace yourselves. He's about to transform!
I make the rules in the art scene!
I am the supreme being!
I am the god of the art world!
I will paint you...
...paint you out of existence!
It looks like the same thing Madarame is using!
If we can completely cover him in it\u2014!
Allow me to handle that.
Do it.
Giving up so soon!?
M-My power... It's fading!
Come forth...
Leanan Sidhe!
Zorro! Let's press the advantage!
Captain Kidd!
Carmen!
You little...
I am "the"...
great Madarame!
Come forth, Goemon!
Uh-oh!
The Palace is starting to collapse!
We've gotta get outta here, Fox!
W-Wait, Yusuke!
What am I supposed to do now?
Put an end to all this...
...and use your own artwork for once.
I-I...
...have committed crimes that are unbecoming of an artist...
Plainly put I... p-plagiarized work...!
To the Japanese arts community...
To "Sayuri"...
And to everyone...
How can I ever make up for my...
Make up for my... transgressions?
In this press conference, famous painter Madarame
has confessed to plagiarism and the abuse of his apprentices.
The police have opened an investigation
to corroborate his claims.
He has also admitted to faking the theft of his masterpiece "Sayuri"
as part of an elaborate counterfeiting scheme.
At this press conference a few days prior,
it was also revealed that a group calling themselves the\nPhantom Thieves posted a dubious note at Madarame's exhibit.
The police are looking into any possible connection between these events.
Seriously though... what're we gonna do about him?
Come stay at our place!
You're a vital part of our team, after all.
It's only natural that we lend a hand!
It's kinda dirty, but at least you'll have somewhere to sleep!
Why're you the one calling the shots?
And the caf\xe9's only a minute walk from the station!
Then how about we go there now and have a party
to celebrate Madarame's change of heart!?
Good idea! We can make it a welcome party for Yusuke, too!
It's decided!
Sorry to cause you trouble.
So, what are we going to do food-wise?
How about hot pot? A hot pot party!
I only ask that we finish it off with porridge. Extra parsley, of course.
It'll be up to you to convince the chief.
I doubt he'll take it well...
I don't mind.
Won't make much difference adding one more tenant.
Though I won't tolerate any noise or disturbances late at night.
Yes, thank you!
Thank you for letting me stay.
Don't mind me!
Coming through!
Friends, huh?
D-Don't get the wrong idea!\nI'm helping the Phantom Thieves for my own sake!
If you guys don't get stronger, I won't stand\na chance of getting further in Mementos!
One second you're depressed,\nthe next you're actin' all tough...
Hey, let's keep going with this.
I want to take this as far as we can.
Punishing corrupt adults and helping those in need...
Only we can do that!
Ha! You can say that again!
Being a member of the Phantom Thieves will surely help me grow,
both as an artist and a person.
Then I'll train you myself.
As Phantom Thieves, there's nothing we can't do!
So, leader... We're counting on you.
...Same here.
I'm turning off the lights.
Night, guys.
Good night.
...What is this?
I found this flyer stuffed in my mailbox!
Housekeeping Service!
It says that a cute maid will do anything for you!
A maid, dude! A MAID!
You're a dude, right? You know what that means.
Right? ...Right!?
You mean... helping out at the cafe?
No, dumbass!
We can do it at my apartment.
The neighbors on my floor just moved out, so there's a spare room.
The key is behind the mailbox, so we can get in anytime.
But, that's\u2014
Studying's important and all...
but you've gotta take breaks, too!
...Hey, I heard that!
Can I get in on this plan of yours?
Oh-ho! You're into this kind of stuff, Mishima?
Least you're honest about it, unlike this guy.
I-I'm not into it!
It's just for research!
What does it mean that they'll do "anything"?
And what's the level of service these so-called maids give?
Are they just as advertised?
This service is super shady! We have a moral obligation to investigate!
To rid this world of evil!
"Rid the world of evil"?
When you put it like that...
When you put it like that, I guess we have... no choice!
Renren!
It's settled, then.
So what's the code name for this operation? Hmm...
I've got it. Operation Maidwatch.
AKA, Meet-A-Maid Up Close And Personal!
Nice! I like that!
Good evening! Your housekeeping service has arrived!
Crap! I've got butterflies in my stomach!
S-Same!
Oh, the door's unlocked...
Um, is it all right for me to come in?
I-I can't do this!
Sorry, the rest is up to you.
Don't let her know you're in high school, got it?
I've got your back! Just... From way back!\nLike, from the balcony!
I'm coming in!
Ah, so you were home after all.
In that case... I'll take my leave for the night.
Wh-Whaaat!? Just like that?
Is someone there!?
You moron!
Oh crap! Run for it, Mishima!
"Mishima"? And that voice...
Sakamoto-kun!?
So then... you really are...
Ms. Kawakami, aren't you?
Y-You're...!
Oh, um...!
Yes, it's me... your homeroom teacher...
...Who did you hear about this from?
It was Ms. Chouno, wasn't it?
She's been all up in my business lately.
Hey... It won't be any better for you if people\nfind out that you called a maid service.
Let's just pretend none of this ever happened.
I'll treat this as a cancellation so you won't have to pay anything.
Anyway, I'm leaving.
Hey... Is it really okay for us keep going?
We can't let the cops scare us outta\nbein' Phantom Thieves.
Is something the matter?
My ears are always open to the troubles\nof my peers, you know.
Seriously? Like you'd be able to help with anything...
What did the student council do to help Shiho\nwhen Kamoshida was abusing her?
You're one to talk. As her friend, what did YOU do?
You were much closer to her than I ever was.
You're right... I wasn't able to help her at all.
But... Because I had friends by my side...
I was finally able to speak to her when it was all done.
I faced her and told her everything I'd been holding back!
Doesn't that count for something?
Wanting to help someone in need...
Everyone has that impulse.
Yeah, that's the kind of thing I can get behind.
...Just make sure you show up to your classes, all right?
I take back what I said before
about whether it's really okay for us keep going.
I'd be ashamed to let it end now...
That's what I'm talking about! We haven't done anything wrong!
This is our style of justice!
Justice...
I have something I'd like you all to listen to...
Wh-What the hell!?
A friend of yours?
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Makoto Niijima, third year at Shujin Academy.
What's the meaning of this...?
Take a listen to this.
Is it really okay for us keep going?
We can't let the cops scare us outta\nbein' Phantom Thieves!
What do you think the police would do if they heard this?
Why are you here?
Did you really come just to tell us
that you're going to report us?
I came here to verify...
this "justice" you speak of.
Right now I'm the only one who's heard this.
If you prove what you're doing is just,
I'll erase this.
She wants to make a deal...
What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
There is someone whose heart I'd like you to change.
Who?
So you're not saying it's impossible.
The boss of a criminal organization.
A criminal organization!?
They operate using phishing scams and drug trafficking.
What's worse, once you're in their sights,
they won't stop threatening you
until they get what they want.
Where can we meet them?
Their main hub of activity is here in Shibuya.
Junya Kaneshiro.
I think he's probably the guy you're looking for.
Kaneshiro...
You should check him out further if you're curious...
but I'm not responsible for what happens next!
There's a Palace for Junya Kaneshiro.
All that's left is figuring out where it is and what form it takes.
We'll just have to take a guess.
It's gotta be about money. The guy's name means "money castle."
He commits fraud and extortion, right?
I'm picturing a place filled with money.
Like a bank...
Match detected.
We were right?
I've got it...
The place that Kaneshiro thinks of as a bank is...
"All of Shibuya."
Woah! This is crazy!
The distortion is affecting the whole of Shibuya!
So he sees everyone in Shibuya as his patron?
W-Wait...! What's that!?
I'm... too tired... Please... let me rest...
So, these must be Kaneshiro's victims.
At the very least,
this is the amount of humans that Kaneshiro\nbelieves he's scammed and destroyed.
This is horrible...
I see, it's the same over there.
Countless victims in all directions.
We won't let him get away with this!
But we won't be able to do anything until we can get up there.
We can't accomplish anything down here.
Let's head back for now.
Hello? It's me... Makoto Niijima.
Just stay on the line and record this call.
That idiot!
Well? What now?
I memorized the license plate!
Guess my artist's eye finally paid off.
Are you Kaneshiro?
What's this? Who did you call?
Kaneshiro-san, that's the girl I told you about.
Deal with her.
Amamiya-kun!
What in the world!?
The hell are you doing to her!?
You better watch your mouth, punk!
Enough.
What's wrong? Why's everyone so stiff?
"Debauchery of Minors at a Club."
You don't mind if I send this to your school, right?
I feed on dumbshits like you...
Summer bonuses are around the corner, you know?
If you beg your mommies and daddies,
you'll have the 3 mil in no time.
That's what all the other brats had to do.
Run your mouth to the police,
and I'll break all of you, starting with your families.
Now get out of my sight. I'm about to have some fun.
Would you like to come with us?
Go with you? Where?
To the world inside Kaneshiro's Heart.
I see... So this is how he views the world.
You want to go to that bank up there, right?
Then let's go.
If I'm a client now...
No way!
It's just as I calculated.
Let them pass.
Kaneshiro!
I know why you're here.
It's about the 3 million yen, right?
I have a reasonable payment plan for people like you.
Join our organization tomorrow
and pay for it with your body!
Is that how you've exploited other girls?
Eehehehe... That's the beautiful student council president for you.
Or should I say... the younger sister of\nthe lovely prosecutor, Sae Niijima.
How do you know that!?
Now be a good girl and do as you're told. It'll be over soon.
Shut your damn mouth, you money-grubbing asshole!
Have you decided to tread the path of strife...?
Yes... Come to me.
Very well. Let us proceed with our contract at once.
I am thou, thou art I...
A Persona...?
No, dude... That's a bike...
I get it now...
This is my true self!
No! We can't fight him now!
To change his heart, we have to steal his Treasure first!
We know how to get in now!
Time to retreat!
Retreat? But how!?
There's only one exit.
I'm going on ahead, so follow me!
All right, let's move!
Sir Junya Kaneshiro, the money-devouring sinner of gluttony...
You indulge in scamming others with horrendous\nmethods that target minors exclusively.
From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.
I-Isn't this bad?
What? The Phantom Thieves?
Like I give a shit!
He changed the room into a giant safe that quickly!?
Greetings.
Welcome to my private city bank.
You filthy fly on dirty money...
Get the hell out of my face!
Yo! Let's do this thing, stupid brats!
Crap!
Let's do this! Carmen!
The hell are you doing, yo!?
You'll burn the whole place down!
Nue!
Crumble before me!
The place you belong... is somewhere you\ncan make amends for the rest of your life.
You stupid brats don't get it.
Look, asshole... You can cut the crap already.
You'd better watch your backs for the one in the black mask.
Their power is in an entirely different league...
A black mask?
To think there's someone else out there able to enter Palaces...
We can think about that later! We need to get out of here!
Ahahaha! I can't get enough! Soooo cooool!
Didn't you hear her, you stupid cat!?
You shouldn't throw animals, dammit!
Whatever, just step on it!
Cram inside, there's no time!
Crap! There's no road!
Isn't this the man the Phantom Thieves sent a calling card for?
I heard he confessed all his crimes.
It was really... out of nowhere.
This would only make sense if his personality changed...
but that would be impossible.
Isn't it good enough that he's behind bars?
The issue is that no one received any credit for it.
Catching him could have landed me a promotion...
Promotion...?
You've changed, Sis.
But... I'll be okay.
Huh? Where is it!?
Oh no... Don't tell me it flew away\nsomewhere...
Huh? H-How do you know my name?
Huh? It's Ayaka Sakai... Why do you ask?
Oh! That's mine!
Phew, I thought I lost it!
Thank you. I can't use this space\nwithout this!
Well... It's a street performance permit.\nThe city's been pretty strict about having\nthem lately.
I was going to play guitar and sing\nright here...
Well... I was planning to. This paper is my\nstreet performance permit.
I was going to play guitar and sing.
But... It seems like whenever I try, my urge\nto sing just fades away.
Maybe I just don't have the courage to sing\nand perform in front of so many people...
I got a permit and everything only to just\nstand on the street with a guitar.
What am I doing...?
Yeah, I used to be in a band. I've been into\nmusic ever since.
I'm sorry... I didn't have any problems when\nI was in a band, but now...
Well, um, an acoustic guitar arrangement of a\nsong my old bandmates and I wrote.
Oh, so you're also in a band! I made mine\nwith my friends in high school too.
Performing live freaks me out, but I never\nhad any problems when it was just us.
What makes it different? Maybe having others\nwith me that get it too?
I'm not sure if it'll really be useful to\nyou, but I feel like... I can play now.
Having another musician here has kinda\nhelped me relax, I guess?
All right! Here I go...
Ah, crap! It's that time already!?
*sigh* I gotta start my shift at work.\nI'll have to try this another time.
Say... Do you come by here often?
Next time you're here, give me a shout.\nI feel like I might be able to sing with\nyou here.
Thanks! Um...
Sorry, can I ask your name? I'm\u2014wait, you\nknow already. Ayaka Sakai. I'm in college.
Thanks, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Oh right. Is it okay if we exchange\ncontact info?
I don't have a single music friend right now,\nso I'd love to chat sometime...
Well then, {NAME1}-kun... See you later!
Ah, {NAME1}-kun!
I wanna try busking again today, but I just\ncan't work up the nerve.
If it's all right with you... Could you stay\nand watch, maybe?
Thank you! I'm feeling good today!
Oh, I see... Meh, it happens. Join me next\ntime, okay?
Okay, here goes nothing!
Sorry... It just felt like they were ignoring\nme and no one was listening...
Maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole\nstreet performing thing.
You're right... I haven't even played past\nthe intro yet.
Ah, I'm sorry! You came out to hear me play,\nand here I am moping around...
I'm gonna try again!
Ayaka?
Ryoko!
Didn't take you for the busking type.
Y-Yeah... Uh, I mean... Well...
I haven't sung anything yet, actually...\nI haven't worked up the nerve to...
Oh.
C'mon now, Ayaka...
Sorry, I have to go. Stuff to do. See you.
S-Sorry, I... I'm gonna go grab something\nto drink...
Sorry... I got a little dizzy, maybe from\nthe nerves.
But I should be fine now!
I made you come out here for me, so I've got\nto sing for real today!
Huh? Oh, uh, right...
*sigh* I'm really sorry...
I shouldn't be making you deal with all\nmy problems...
I'll try again later. I'm sorry for wasting\nyour time...
Thank you again, {NAME1}-kun.
I didn't pull off a performance, but having\nyou here did make me feel better.
I guess we're done for today. I'll talk to\nyou later.
I'm going to try busking today!
If it's okay with you, do you think you could\nstay and watch like last time?
Thank you! I'm giving it my best shot today,\nI promise! Just hold on while I set up!
Sorry for leaving you hanging with my last\nperformance. But today I'm giving it my all!
You can do this, Ayaka...\nToday's the day for sure...
Uh, what do mean?
Wait, you can see the bags under my eyes!?\nBut I tried so hard to cover them up...
You remember that girl who spoke to me last\ntime we were here?
Well, her name's Ryoko, and she's one of my\nfriends from high school.
She invited me to join her band, and that's\nwhat got me into music.
I always liked listening to music, but never\nimagined doing it myself.
If she hadn't brought me into the band,\nI don't think I'd be who I am today.
Anyhow, things changed after we started\ncollege. Our bandmates all went to\ndifferent schools...
But I think the main thing was that Ryoko\njust quit playing music one day.
I guess the band just naturally fell apart\nafter that.
Not sure... All I know is she lost the\nmotivation for it all of a sudden.
If that was the case, she could've just\nbroken up the band and not abandoned\nmusic entirely...
At the time, I did get the feeling that\nRyoko's passion for music was waning.
I still wanted to play though. So I've been\ntrying to keep it up...
But I'm a shy person at heart\u2014or maybe faint\nof heart is a better way to put it...
Either way, I don't have the courage to start\nmy own band or join another one.
But I realized I could busk on my own, so I\nthought I'd try that...
Turns out, I don't have the guts for this\neither... I still haven't actually sung\nanything.
The only reason I've ever been able to make\nmusic is because I've been relying on Ryoko\nand the rest of the band...
When I saw Ryoko, I was sure she'd tell me\nI'd never be able to play anything solo...
I know she's not one to say something like\nthat, but still, I do feel like a failure...
That's pretty much how I feel all the time\nlately...
Ah... Sorry, I forgot I had work today!
I gotta go. I know I didn't manage to sing\ntoday either, but...
Yeah... I guess that's true.
Hearing it from you helps me believe it,\nat least. Thanks.
Thanks... It makes me really happy to hear\nyou say that.
{NAME1}-kun... Thanks for this. Really.
You're younger than me, but you've got it so\ntogether. I should learn from you.
See you later, then... I'll be in touch.
Oh, {NAME1}-kun! It means a lot that you\ncame, but I've got to apologize...
I couldn't get a permit for today, so I can't\nplay music here after all.
I did bring my guitar, but just because it\nhelps me feel calm.
R-Really? If you know a place that would\nwork, I won't say no...
Yeah, see you. I'm gonna stick around for a\nbit. Come say hi if you're free later.
I don't really know any other places to play\naround here. Would you happen to have any\nideas, {NAME1}-kun?
Oh, really? Let's try going there, then!
I don't have work today, so I don't mind if\nit's a bit out of the way.
Now I see. This park is pretty big and there\naren't many people around now, so we can\nplay without getting in trouble.
But... Of course, I'm still getting\nnervous...
Actually, now that I think about it, I've\nnever sung in front of you at all, have I?
It's kind of a relief for my first audience\nto be just you. It's... nice?
Okay... Here I go...
S-So, what do you think?
Th-Thank you! Even if you're just being nice,\nI appreciate it.
Yeah... Super nervous, I could barely get my\nvoice out. I'm so rusty...
Um... Well, it's not like I've never\nperformed at all.
I played rhythm guitar in high school.\nAlthough I liked playing, I just didn't want\nto stand out.
One of my friends was the lead vocalist.\nThe girl we saw in Shibuya the other day.
There was one song we did where she got me to\ndo the vocals.
That was the one I sang now. It's an original\nour band wrote together.
We put our own music to the lyrics we wrote\nand performed it at our school festival.
I could never forget what it felt like to see\nan audience listen to my voice like that.
I think that's why I still cling to my guitar\neven after our band broke up.
But you can see how well that's going...
Uh... At least for this song, I think if I\nhad some way to kick myself into gear...
Then the nerves would go away, and I'd be\nable to sing through to the end after those\nfirst few notes.
That's how it felt today. Once I started\nsinging, I was cool as a cucumber.
Huh? Someone from your band club told\nyou that?
I see. They are right that rhythm is\nimportant for a mid-tempo ballad.
So you think that if I tap out the rhythm\nfirst, it'll feel more natural to start\nsinging?
You might be on the right track there...\nIt was written for a band, so it wants a\nclear rhythm...
Ugh, I'm at my limit doing guitar and vocals\nalone, and now I need percussion?
I can't play drums and the guitar at the\nsame time...
Hm... Maybe if I did some kind of cheer\nbefore singing? Like sports teams do?
Like... "We've got spirit! Yes we... do..."
Yeah, never mind...
Maybe a different cheer would be better?
B-Booyah!?
R-Ready, set, go!?
Huh? H-Here... we... GO!?
Hehe. If I have to do that first, performing\nshould feel like a breeze.
Thanks, I think I'm feeling better about all\nthis now.
I finally managed to sing for someone on\nmy own. Performing really does feel good!
I think I can do this now!
The next time I busk, I'm going to blow\neveryone's socks off. Of course, I'll let you\nknow before so you can see!
{NAME1}-kun, I think I'm going to try\nbusking today!
Are you free to stick around and watch?
Oh, I see... Don't worry about it then.\nJoin me another time, okay?
All right... Today's the day!
Oh, y-yeah!
H-Here... we... GO!
Hehe... Hahaha! That was a pretty poor cheer.
Still, thanks. That really broke the tension.\nI... I really think I can do it today.
And you'll be watching, I hope?
A trick?
You... brought something?
A tambourine...?
Oh, what's going on here?
Is someone performing?
Wait, that's right! Rhythm!
Well that explains the tambourine...
{NAME1}-kun.
Um... Do you think you could keep doing\nthat, but calmer? I want the lead-in to be\nsuper gentle.
I'm gonna do the song I played for you in\nthe park.
And do you think you could lay a beat in\nas a fill after the first verse? Then after\nthat...
Just like we discussed, okay?
All right, let's do this!
A busker? I didn't think people did that\naround here.
I walk by every day, but I never noticed...
That girl's actually pretty good.
Phew...
Oh my god! Your voice is amaaaazing!
Everything's been kind of... dull lately, but\nyour song really moved me.
Do you have an agent yet? You could be a\nreal hit, kid!
O-Oh, um... Thank you all very much!
{NAME1}-kun! I did it! I sang!
Y-You really think so? Thank you...
Uh-huh. My heart's still racing...
But... I'm just so...
Hey, did you write that song yourself? Do you\nhave others?
I-I made it with some friends, so I guess I\nwrote it myself, in a way?
Let's hear another song!
Encore! Encore!
Um, uh...?
Uh... Well, in that case...
I never expected that you'd show up with a\ntambourine of all things!
But thanks to that little surprise, I finally\nmanaged to sing my song.
It's like I can still feel that beat you laid\ndown thumping inside me...
I know I'll be able to sing from now on,\neven on my own.
Thank you, {NAME1}-kun. This was an\nincredible day.
U-Um, so...
Now that I've pulled off a performance, I'm a\nbit hungry to do more. You see...
Eventually... I want to sing an original that\nI've made from scratch.
I've never written lyrics or anything before,\nso I don't know how long it'll take.
But if I do manage to write one...
Huh!? I-I didn't mean right away...
Hmm, but...
I do kinda feel like I could do anything\nright now...
I'll give it a shot. Let's see what kind of\nsong I can write.
Thank you so much for today. I'll message\nyou later.
Sorry. I saw you earlier, but I was in the\nmiddle of a song!
I haven't had trouble singing alone since our\njam sesh together.
A lot of people are coming up and listening\nto my performances these days!
And it's all thanks to you! Seriously,\nI can't thank you enough.
Oh, I almost forgot. There's something I\nwanted to ask you.
So I've been trying to write a song like we\ntalked about...
But what do you think I should prioritize,\n{NAME1}-kun? The lyrics or melody?
Yeah, you're right. I like lyrics that are\nfull of what the singer's trying to say too.
You're right. A good, clear melody can be the\nbest way to convey a song's feeling.
Yeah... You don't really have a song until\nyou have both the words and music.
I've been so stuck on where to start that I\nhaven't really gotten anywhere with either.
I have lots of memories and feelings I'd\nlike to sing about, chords and riffs I want\nto play...
But when I sit down to write something,\nI just can't pick a thing to work on.
The technical stuff like chord resolutions\nand beat structure is pretty easy, though.
I guess it's always hard to make something\nfrom scratch. What should I do...?
What I want to say... I guess...
That I love singing and that sharing my\nfeelings through song makes me happy?
Yeah... Maybe that's the only way.
That's what it was like in our band too.\nWe all kept tossing in ideas till we had\na song.
A person that I want to sing to\nspecifically, huh...?
Yeah... I think that could work.
Thanks, {NAME1}-kun. I think that made\nsomething click for me.
I'll start working on the song as soon as I\nget home. I feel like it'll be a breeze now!
I'm glad I asked you about this.\nYou really are\u2014
Whoa... I almost said something super\nembarrassing just now...
Er, sorry! Never mind, it was nothing...
Anyway, {NAME1}-kun, do you have time\nafter this?
I'm gonna be playing here for a while, so if\nyou'd like to stay and listen...
Awesome!
Oh, {NAME1}-kun...
As I was busking earlier, Ryoko showed up...
I've been getting better at talking to people\nrecently, so I thought I'd say hi to her...
We talked about a bunch of stuff, like how\nwe've been doing, and I learned why she\nquit music.
She's wanted to be a professional musician\never since high school.
But she said she felt too weighed down by\nfamily stuff and worries that she wasn't\ntalented enough...
You really are a good singer, Ayaka. Even\nwhile playing guitar, you don't fall out of\nrhythm at all.
Thanks, but it's all because you taught me\nthe basics back in high school!
You always had talent. And you seem happier\nnow. I mean, you're practically glowing!
You were definitely meant to be a musician,\nAyaka. More than I ever was.
Ryoko! That's not true, you just\u2014
Ayaka... Just keep playing, okay? Make both\nof our dreams come true.
I couldn't do it, but I'm sure you have what\nit takes to be great.
Hearing you play allowed me to accept that.\nKeep at it, okay?
Wait, Ryoko! Don't...
I wanted to ask her if she was willing to\nplay music with me again.
I even thought maybe she could help me with\nthe song I'm working on...
Did I do something wrong? What do I do now?
Thanks... You're very kind.
No, I've got so much left to say! I just\ndon't know how to put it all into words...
Right now, I want to...
{NAME1}-kun, are you free after this?
Could you come to Inokashira Park with me?
Even when I feel like this\u2014no, especially\nwhen I feel like this, I really want to sing.
But not as a street performance. The only\nperson I want to listen to this song is you.
Thank you. Let's go to the usual spot, then?
Sorry... I guess I just made you listen to a\nwhole medley of sad songs...
It's funny though. Sad songs are more\ncomforting to sing than cheerful ones.
I wonder why...
Yeah, of course.
If I know it, I'll sing it for you. I've been\nmaking you listen to my feelings all\nthe time.
Haha, sure...
I'm always learning things from you, so it'd\nbe nice to be the teacher for once.
Ugh... There you go looking after me again...
Okay, how about we play something together\nnext time? You can bring your bass.
It's a plan, then! I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, {NAME2}-kun!
Perfect timing! I was just about to send you\na message.
Remember what we talked about last time?\nAbout playing a song together?
Would you be up for that now? If you have\ntime, of course.
Great... You'll need to get your bass\nfirst, though.
Hey, can I come with you? I don't mind\nwaiting here, but it feels like a waste.
It'd be, uh... more fun if we had more time\nto talk, y'know?
You're really good, {NAME2}-kun! You really\njust started playing?
Guitar and bass go well together of course,\nbut it's also just... really fun to play\nwith you.
Bassists are like the glue that holds a band\ntogether. I'm jealous of your bandmates!
Are you planning to perform for a school\nfestival or anything? If so, I want to watch!
Also...
You're so... considerate when you play.\nI noticed it with the tambourine, too.
It feels like you're really listening to me,\nlike you're ready to back up anything I play.
Even when we were jamming just now, I got\nthat feeling, like you were looking out\nfor me...
Well... Our little sesh today confirmed it,\nbut I've had an inkling for a while.
The fact that you can look me in the eye and\nsay that... Why am I the embarrassed one!?
It's no use playing dumb now! My ears\ndon't lie.
Oh... Thank you...
How about we take a little break?
I'm still working on writing that song.\nIt's going slow, but it's going.
Sometimes when working on it, Ryoko's words\npop up in my mind and it gives me writer's\nblock...
But lately I've been thinking of other\nthings too. Like all the fun times we had\nin the band.
Or like the first time you talked to me.\nThose kinds of memories.
I think this fun jam session that I had with\nyou today is gonna be one of those too.
Ryoko asked me to take her dreams and make\nthem come true. Maybe I should really do it.
I don't know if that's what she really wants.\nIt might even end up bothering her.
But I'm not going to forget about our old\nband, no matter what.
It's the memories from that band that have\nkept me going this whole time.
Looking back, this is all because you reached\nout to me.
And, um... There's one more thing I want to\nthank you for.
Whether it be listening to it or singing it,\nI've always found strength in music.
I think that's what drew me to it and made me\nwant to keep it in my life.
I never really thought about why songs could\ngive me strength back then...
But now that I'm writing my own lyrics,\nI think I finally get it.
In a song, you can say things you normally\ncan't to someone's face.
You can just blurt out all the things you're\ntoo uncertain or afraid to talk about.
But I think people don't even notice they\nhave things like that they want to say.
So, um... That's what I wanted to thank\nyou for.
When I'm with you, I notice the things I want\nto say, the feelings I want to put into song.
It's like the dam holding back my thoughts\nopens and the words come flooding out.
As if having you by my side suddenly turns\nthe voice of my heart into a song...
Sorry... It's just I find I want to say a\nmillion things at once whenever I'm with\nyou, so... um...
Basically what I wanted to say was,\n"thank you for spending time with me."
That's all, really.
Ugh, this is exactly the kind of thing that\nwould be easier to say in a song...
Truth is though, there is something that\nI want to say to you even more, or rather\nask you...
So, like...
{NAME2}-kun... How do you feel about me?
You do? Oh, uh... Okay.
Then I'll keep working even harder! Just you\nwait and see!
Thanks for today, I think I'm gonna be able\nto write some great lyrics after this.
How about we play one last song together,\nbefore we call it for today?
I-If that's true, it makes me really happy...
I, um...
I've always thought, I like being with you...\nand I'd like to keep being with you too...
Do you feel the same?
Wow... I don't know what to say... Sorry,\nI might get a li'l teary!
Do you think we could stay here together a\nlittle longer today?
I'm feeling some really good lyrics coming on\nright now, so...
I'd like to keep going... With you...
Sorry for making you wait! You could've said\nsomething earlier.
By the way, I finished the lyrics for the new\nsong! The main melody is mostly done too.
I thought I'd let you know right away if I\nsaw you today.
I'm still figuring out some bits, like the\noutro and the chords leading into the chorus.
But I'm still figuring out some bits, like\nthe outro and the chords leading into the chorus.
{NAME2}-kun, let's go somewhere a bit\nmore private.
Ever since I started working on this song,\nI've wanted you to be the first one to\nhear it.
How about we go to our usual bench at\nInokashira Park?
So, what do you think? If you have any\ncomments or critiques, I'd love to hear...
Thank you! I'm glad you like it... And kind\nof relieved too.
I haven't yet, but... I do know what the song\nis about, that's for sure.
I made this song for all the people who have\nsupported me until now.
There's Ryoko, who got me into playing\nmusic, the folks who listened to my first\nperformance...
Plus, so many others who supported me and\nhelped me get to where I am right now,\nsinging my own songs.
This song is for all of them, but most of\nall, it's for you, {NAME2}-kun.
It's because of you that I've been able to\nkeep going.
Your presence even helped me come to\nterms with this dream entrusted to me by\nmy friends.
And now, I feel like I can make that dream\nhappen myself.
I want this song to convey all of those\nfeelings... but it's still just a rough\ndraft.
This is probably enough for just busking\nwith my guitar, but I want it to sound more\npolished...
I also think having a solid rhythm would get\nthe point of the song across better.
Even just adding a tambourine like you did\nbefore would really change the song's impact.
That'd be great! You could get your\nbass and...
Oh, that could be good! Let's try it out!
Oh, but I guess it would be a pain to go pick\nup your bass now...
Maybe we should do this another time?
Shimokita? Oh, where your school is...\nIs there studio space we can use around\nthere?
I'm fine with anywhere we can play together.
Your advisor? Wait, like for your school's\nband club!?
W-Well, I guess if they'd let us use your\nclub room that would solve our problem...
All right, I might just take you up on that\noffer. Thanks!
I've got all kinds of ideas to improve the\nsong going through my head right now...
I want to try them out before I forget them!
It's kinda nerve-racking visiting a school I\ndon't go to...
But I'm glad your teacher gave us permission.\nThis seems like a great place to play.
My heart's racing just thinking of how we'll\nbe alone together in an empty classroom...
Better not let our time here go to waste!\nWanna get started?
I think that's pretty good! There's just a\nfew details left to adjust...
I'm kind of surprised it went this quickly!
Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing it for\nreal at the station square.
We should debut the song together! I'll send\nyou a message then.
Thanks again for today. It was really fun!
When the song's done, I'll let you know.\nGet pumped!
So, uh, {NAME2}-kun... You've got time after\nthis, right?
Uh, I mean, I don't have any plans or\nanything, so...
I just thought, I wouldn't mind, y'know,\nstaying with you a bit longer...
Ah, {NAME2}-kun! I finished the song!
I'd really like you to play it with me for\nthe first performance, so...
Fantastic, thank you! I'll be waiting\nright here.
I got an acoustic-electric guitar for this!
Maybe we should have done a proper\nrehearsal first...
But the bassline's the same as what we came\nup with last time at your school.
I think you'll be able to pick it up\npretty fast.
Yeah. I always can.
Hehe, don't worry. I know you can do it.
Okay... How about we try it once with the\nvolume down?
Perfect.
I think your playing has improved even more\nsince our last practice!
All right, shall we then?
Haha!
Ayaka-saaaan!
Hey! Thanks for coming out today!
We've got a new song to play for you today.\nJust hold on while we get ready!
I've got a backing track with the drums and\nthings loaded on the keyboard.
It'll start when I press the button.\nYou ready?
I figured. Let's go!
Glad I'm not the only one getting nervous...\nOkay, I'll count from five.
Five... four... three... two...
One!
...Phew.
Th-Thank you!
That was totes awesome! I didn't know you did\nsongs like that too, Ayaka-san!
Do you have that song up online or something?\nI wanna put it on repeat!
No, I haven't uploaded it anywhere...\nI mean, that was the first time we've played\nit live, so...
Seriously!? So this was, like, an exclusive\ndebut!? Damn, I should've recorded it!
Ayaka-san! Play it again! Encore, encore!
Ah, hehehe... Thank you!
But first, just give me a minute, okay?
{NAME2}-kun.
Could you just wait here? Just having you\nhere is enough. I'll be okay.
Thanks. I'll be back soon.
Ryoko... You stayed to listen?
I honestly didn't expect you to take what I\nsaid to heart...
Thank you...
No, that's my line. Thank you, Ryoko.
You've really changed, Ayaka.
Have I?
I think so. Though you're still the same\nat heart.
Maybe it's because of that boy?
Keep at it, Ayaka. I'll come to see you\nplay again.
Yeah. You hang in there too, Ryoko.
All right, we're playing that song again,\nthen?
A toast to our new song's success!
Cheers!
This spot is starting to feel like a second\nhome, almost...
So much has happened here... Like the first\ntime you listened to me sing.
So much has happened here. Like the first\ntime you listened to me sing...
And... the day we...
I could say thank you a thousand times and it\nstill wouldn't feel like enough.
Since meeting you, I've become able to sing\non my own.
And I'm not going to stop anytime soon.
Next time I have a new song ready, I'll be\nsure you're the first to know.
And I hope you'll be the first to listen\nto it, too.
Yeah, you'd better!
'Cause I'm going to make the best songs\nI can!
Well... If I'm feeling down again, I hope\nyou'll be there for me again.
Until then, I'll try making the best songs I\ncan on my own.
I'm thinking about the next song I want to\nwrite too.
I can't seem to stop thinking of things I\nwant to sing when I'm with you...
Thank you. But actually...
Something like that... But actually...
I already have an idea for my next song.
I've got most of the lyrics down, but I'm not\nreally sure about the melody.
Do you think you could keep helping me with\nmy songwriting?
We could do it here... or somewhere else...
No matter what life throws at us, let's stay\nby each other's side forever.
Hey, so no pressure if you don't have\ntime, but...
Could we meet up now?
Great! I'll wait for you at my usual spot.
Got it. Lemme know if you feel like it\nanother time!
Hey! Are you busy today?
I was thinking of going somewhere and was\nwondering if you'd like to come with.
Really? I'm so happy to hear that!
Let's get going then!
Oh, sorry. I guess it was kinda last minute.\nMaybe another time?
Oh man, it's been so long since I've\nbeen here!
I used to come with my bandmates all\nthe time.
We'd lose our voices screaming on all the\nrides and then chat about music the whole\nway home.
But these days they're all busy and we can't\nget our schedules to line up.
Not that I don't also turn down my fair share\nof invites from work and class...
But... recently, I've just had this urge to\ncome here again.
I'm not sure why. Maybe because I've finally\nmade a new music friend?
Anyway, thanks for coming with me! What\nshould we try out first?
Oh, right, I should mention I'm not great\nwith thrill rides...
Ooh... Sounds great! I can't even remember\nthe last time I went on a Ferris wheel!
What!? Okay... Just this one time.
Hahaha.
Hey, do you think we could do this again next\ntime you're free?
I don't think one day is enough to try out\neverything!
Here we are again, haha. What should we ride?
Sorry for dragging you out with me.
I like it here, though. It's quiet, lots\nof nature...
It gets busy when the high schoolers come to\ndo the occasional cleaning for community\nservice, though.
Sometimes, I come here when I'm feeling down.
Things have been kinda rough with college and\nwork lately...
I mean, it's nothing super serious, don't\nworry. Just a lot of minor things...
But small problems can really weigh you down when they start to pile up.
At times like this, I just wanna get away\nfrom places that remind me of it all, y'know?
Yeah. Hey, thanks for that.
Nah... It's reassuring to have someone by\nmy side.
Inviting you was the right choice. Getting\nlost in conversation helps me take a break\nfrom my problems.
Hey, wanna take a loop around the park?\nThere's boats and a lot of different stuff.
I know a really pretty area with benches,\ntoo. It's my favorite spot.
Plus, different flowers bloom there every\nseason. I'm not sure what's out now...
If you'd be up for it, I'd love to come here\ntogether again sometime.
It's nice and quiet here again today. What do\nyou wanna do?
Heyyy! Look who it is! How've you been?
Sorry but the movie's gonna start soon...\nI'll play with you next time, okay?
Bye bye!
Sorry about that. I haven't seen that kitty\nfor a while, so I had to...
I come down to Yongen-Jaya a lot. The theater\nhere shows old movies sometimes.
It's pretty nice. The plots aren't overly\ncomplicated, and the classics have great\nmusic too.
It's a cool feeling when you recognize a song\nin the middle of the movie, y'know?
So which do you like more, vintage films or\nthe more recent stuff?
Oh, that's perfect then!
Ah... Oh, but I think you'll still be able to\nappreciate this one!
They're showing an old movie that had a\nremake come out just recently.
I think you'll enjoy it! Anyway, it's\nstarting soon. How about we head in?
So, uh... Do you think you'd be interested\nin coming to the movies with me again\nsometime?
I like these sorts of films, so I come here\nevery so often.
No obligation or anything! Just, y'know...\nIf you feel like it.
I wonder if there's anything interesting on\ntoday... What are you in the mood for?
Every now and then, I'll get this huge\ncraving to see the ocean, y'know? Just out\nof the blue.
I do like the beach too, but I was more in\nthe mood for something like this today.
Just listening to the sound of the waves is\nso soothing...
It's always so pretty here.
During the day, the sunlight dances off the\nsea, and at night you can see all the city\nlights...
It's really... I dunno, romantic?
What am I saying? Sorry, I didn't mean to\nsound all cheesy just then.
Y-Yeah, it is. Thanks... Sorry, I made things\nawkward all of a sudden.
Say, how about we take a stroll around?
There are some fun shops, photo spots and a\nwhole load of other stuff around here.
They're all kinda difficult to go to on your\nown, y'know? So it'd be nice to go while I\nhave you here.
It's always so beautiful here. I feel like I\ncould just watch the waves forever...
I SEE THE SEA!
Don't you just get the urge to yell out at\nthe top of your lungs at a place like this?
I really love the ocean.
The smell of salt in the wind, the sound of\nwaves, the horizon stretching out forever...
The only downside is that it's so far away\nfrom Shibuya!
I'm glad we could come here today.
No, thank you! Really.
Then let's get something to eat!
There's supposed to be a lot of good food\naround here, but I've never tried any.
Since we came all the way out here, let's\ntreat ourselves! I just got my paycheck, too!
So could we come here together again? Maybe\nevery once in a while even?
Being here alone is okay, but... it's\ndefinitely more fun with you.
I SEE THE SEA! Hehe!
Huh? Y-You're giving this to me? Really!?
Thank you. I love it!
No way, you're serious!? I've been wanting\none of these!
You're saying I can have it? I... am...\nThat's... uh...
I... I'm so happy, I'm lost for words...\nBut seriously... Thank you!
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun, are you free now?
If you have time, I was thinking it'd be fun\nto jam together again.
Awesome! I'll be waiting at my usual spot.
Oh too bad. I'm in Shibuya today, so let me know\nif you find the time!
Oh, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
If you have time, I was thinking it'd be fun\nto jam together again...
I feel like taking it easy indoors today, though.\nKnow any good places?
Wait, as in your house!?
N-Now that you mention it, th-that does sound\nkinda nice. Yeah...
S-Sorry, no can do! My place is tiny and a\nhuge mess! M-Maybe another time\u2014after I\nclean...
Thanks again for inviting me...
Really nice place you've got here...\nIt's really clean, and uh...
R-Right, yeah! Thanks!
N-N-No, n-not at all! I'm just a little, uh,\ntense...
I've, uh, never actually been over to a guy's\nhouse before... Hahaha...
Plus, I don't think I've played at someone\nelse's place since high school band practice.
We'd go to one of the band member's houses\nand jam out until their folks got home.
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun, you said your parents were out\non a trip somewhere?
I guess I can stay over as late as we\nwant, then!
Oh, uh, that's... very generous of you,\nthanks...
Yeah! How many songs do you think we'll get\nthrough?
Well then, shall we get started?
My fingers are itching to play something\nalready!
Thanks for having me over again. Hehe!
Right...
What'd you call me?
Really!?
The target should be in this area.
Let's look carefully.
Should we head straight there?
Thank you, {NAME2}.
Thank you again, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Which is it exactly?
And to that end...
Aaagh!
Now that I'm in the band club,\nthat girl with the guitar\nkeeps grabbing my attention...
It could be worth hearing\nher play...
I decided to leave the area.
She hasn't started performing\nyet. It looks like she's\nmissing something...
It's some kind of\nofficial document...
"Ayaka Sakai" is written in\nthe name field...
So Ayaka used to be in a band...
Maybe if I could hear her\nplay, I'd learn something\nuseful for the band club...
I told her how I just joined\nthe band club at school and\nwant to learn from her.
I told her my name.
We exchanged contact info.
Spending time with Ayaka,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
Ayaka started strumming...
Her tone is so clear... Nobody\nat band club could hold a\ncandle to her!
There was no reaction to her\nperformance. It was as if they\ndidn't hear it at all.
It looks like the crowd's\nindifference really\ndemoralized her...
Something's off with Ayaka...
Ayaka's still looking faint.\nShe probably shouldn't\npush herself.
I feel my bond with Ayaka\ngrowing deeper...
She doesn't look so good...
Maybe she's sleep-deprived?
Looks like it might be a good idea to call off\nbusking today too...
I asked her if there was anything that was\nstressing her out.
This problem runs deeper than\nI thought.
I think Ayaka needs some\nmotivation to find\nher courage...
I told her about the band club\npracticing at Inokashira Park.
Ayaka and I headed to\nInokashira Park together.
Ayaka started singing...
Although her nerves caused her voice to\nshake, her singing was so captivating!
She's being modest. Both her singing and\nguitar playing were mesmerizing.
Ayaka looks more happier than ever.\nGetting through a song must've\nboosted her confidence.
Afterwards, we had a heated\ndiscussion about music for\na while.
The atmosphere really changed\nonce Ayaka started singing!
But she's so absorbed in\nthe song, I can't tell if\nshe's noticed...
Isn't that Ayaka's friend? How long has she\nbeen here?
Ayaka's voice reverberated\nthroughout Shibuya Station\nSquare...
Ayaka's performing alone...
Looks like Ayaka spotted me...
Afterwards, I watched the rest\nof Ayaka's performance before\nsaying goodbye...
Ayaka's just standing there\nwith her guitar. She looks\nkind of down...
She definitely seems to be\nfeeling down...
Ayaka and I visited\nInokashira Park together.
Ayaka's singing sounds more\nsorrowful than usual...
Ayaka and I parted ways\nafter having a chill hangout\ntogether.
Ayaka's standing alone looking\nat her phone. It seems like\nsomething's on her mind...
Ayaka and I visited my school.
After picking up my bass,\nwe headed to Inokashira Park.
I should choose my next\nwords carefully...
Ayaka and I parted ways after\njamming out together.
I am now in a relationship\nwith Ayaka...
There's no turning back now...
When we played this time, it felt like our\nhearts were truly in sync.
Ayaka's busking today...
As Ayaka strummed a\nmelancholic melody, I could\nfeel the warmth in her voice.
Ayaka and I worked out a bass\npart for her original song.
I walked Ayaka to the station.
Ayaka and I spent some time\nalone together...
We gave the audience their\nencore and played Ayaka's\nnew song again.
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Ayaka...
After our little celebration,\nI walked Ayaka to the station\nand said goodbye...
We headed back to the\nstation discussing ideas for\nour next song...
Sounds like Ayaka wants to\nmeet up. I should head\nover now.
We should go there\nanother time...
Ayaka and I explored the\namusement park. We took in the\nview from the Ferris wheel.
Ayaka and I explored the\namusement park. We ordered our\nfavorites at the food court.
Ayaka and I explored the\namusement park. We rode\nwhatever caught our eyes.
Ayaka and I explored the\namusement park. The fairground\nmusic got us talking.
Ayaka and I explored the\namusement park. We discussed\nmusic on the train ride home.
Ayaka and I visited Inokashira\nPark. We rowed out onto the\nlake together.
Ayaka and I visited Inokashira\nPark. We took a nice stroll\naround together.
Ayaka and I visited Inokashira\nPark. We shared a nice meal at\na nearby caf\xe9.
Ayaka and I visited Inokashira\nPark. We played with a cat\nthat started following us.
Ayaka and I visited Inokashira\nPark. We chatted for who knows\nhow long in her favorite spot.
Ayaka and I went to a movie\ntheater in Yongen-Jaya.\nWe watched an old classic.
Ayaka and I went to a movie\ntheater in Yongen-Jaya.\nWe enjoyed an old masterpiece.
Ayaka and I went to a movie\ntheater in Yongen-Jaya.\nI loved the movie she chose.
Ayaka and I went to a movie\ntheater in Yongen-Jaya.\nWe hadn't seen this one yet.
Ayaka and I went to a movie\ntheater in Yongen-Jaya, then\nplayed with a cat outside.
Ayaka and I took a trip to\nOdaiba Seaside Park. We gazed\nat the glistening ocean...
Ayaka and I took a trip to\nOdaiba Seaside Park. We found\na wonderful restaurant nearby.
Ayaka and I took a trip to\nOdaiba Seaside Park. A stray\ncat approached us for pets...
Ayaka and I took a trip to\nOdaiba Seaside Park. We talked\nabout recent music we like.
Ayaka and I took a trip to\nOdaiba Seaside Park. Tons of\nstray cats came up to her.
Ayaka and I strolled along\nMiura Beach. We spent a long\nwhile gazing at the waves...
Ayaka and I strolled along\nMiura Beach. We had our fill\nof some local specialties...
Ayaka and I strolled along\nMiura Beach. We walked along\nthe water's edge and chatted.
Ayaka and I strolled along\nMiura Beach. Our shoes got\nsoaked, but we laughed it off.
Ayaka and I strolled along\nMiura Beach. We discussed our\nfavorite beach tunes.
Should I give this to Yaoling?
Maybe another time.
Sounds like Ayaka wants to\nhave a jam session with me.\nI should head over...
Ayaka and I went over to\nmy place...
Ayaka and I rocked out\ntogether. Her pure tone\nechoed through the house...
Okie!
I get it.
Yup.
Hey, are you free right now?
There's a place I want to visit, but I\nthought it'd be more fun with you.
I'm glad to hear that! Truth is, I spent all\nmorning thinking about how to invite you.
All right! Let's get going!
I see... Let's go together when you're free.
This is where just about everyone meets up,\nisn't it?
Since the bar's in Shibuya, I actually pass\nby this area just about every day.
But that also makes it feel like I'm on my\nway to work, so I try not to hang out here\nmuch.
I mean, what if I run into a regular or\nsomething? That'd totally take the wind out\nof my sails on a day off...
I'd probably just want to go home and sleep\nif that happened. Or find somewhere to drink\nnear my place...
Oh, how chivalrous of you. So this garden-y\narea...
There are lots of high schoolers around in\nthe day, huh? I guess they're on their way\nhome.
Yeah, I think if I'm with you, it won't feel\nas much like I'm on my way to work.
You seem to know Shibuya well, {NAME2}-kun.\nMaybe we should hang out here together more\noften?
I like that enthusiasm! It's got me feeling\nexcited too!
All right then, give me the full tour! I'd\nlove to get to know Shibuya better.
I like us meeting here. It really feels like\nwe're in Tokyo, y'know?
This area's pretty much my backyard!
I stop by for a few drinks when I have time,\nso I know all the bars here.
Unlike ours, many of them don't let minors\nin, though...
Not too many places I can take you to, huh?
Hey, if you manage to live till eighty, that\nmeans you'll be able to drink for the next\nsixty years of your life!
So you should cherish not getting hangovers\nand stuff while you can, hehehe.
Yeah. That's the right attitude, young man.
Life's better sometimes when you don't rush\ninto things.
I love drinking. It's a pastime I enjoy\nvery much.
That being said, I've also made a lot of\nmistakes when I'm drunk...
Like, take that bar over there, for example.
I got drunk there once and was in such a good\nmood that I picked up everyone else's tabs...
You can imagine how shocked I was the next\nmorning to find my wallet empty!
I told you I can't bring along a minor!
But thanks. I appreciate you saying that.
Now then, how does dinner somewhere other\nthan a bar sound?
There'll be no alcohol while I'm strolling\naround here with you!
Wow... That was beautiful! Thanks for tagging\nalong, by the way.
I've always wanted to come, but a\nplanetarium's not the easiest place to visit\non your own.
Well, I was wondering if I could make a\ncocktail or mocktail themed around stars.
Of course, a drink has to taste good, but it\nhas to look presentable as well.
I want to make a drink that satisfies even\nbefore you put your lips to the glass.
So, {NAME2}-kun. Any cool ideas for the\ndrink?
That shouldn't be too hard to pull off!
They do sell ice trays shaped like stars,\nright?
I could even use fruit juice for the ice\ncubes or something!
Oh, that's a good one. It'll be a challenge,\nthat's for sure.
I guess I could mix in layers of blue and\npurple to create a gradient like that.
Maybe I'll throw in some kind of star\ndecoration around the rim to make it cuter\ntoo.
I came here to look for inspiration today,\nbut I didn't expect it to be this much fun!
Wanna come here again?
Thanks! I'll hold you to it, then!
I wonder if they're showing anything cool\ntoday... Any constellations you wanna keep an\neye out for?
I come here whenever I feel down.
When I'm somewhere up high, my worries just\nseem to melt away.
Like, all my problems feel so miniscule from\nup here, you know?
By the way... Today will be the first time\nI've ridden this with someone else!
Hehe, how do you feel about getting to be the\nfirst person to share a gondola with me?
Haha. Thanks!
Really though, the honor's all mine.
The scenery looks all different. Maybe it's\nbecause you're here...
Now that I've learned how fun it is to ride\nwith someone else...
...I hope you'll come here with me again. You\nwere the one who taught me, after all.
Great! Let's enjoy the view!
Are you excited to look down on the world\nfrom high up again today? Let's do this!
Truth is, I've never made monja myself\nbefore.
I'm sure I'll figure it out. I've seen how\nothers do it!
Three, two, one... Here I go!
Hup! Wait, what? That's not how it's supposed\nto go...
Oh no! The liquid's seeping through! Aaaah!
Wow, I did a terrible job...
Thanks, {NAME2}-kun. I knew I could count\non you!
Show me how you do it!
Whoa! You fixed it in no time flat!
Wh-Where did you learn to do this!?
Wow, {NAME2}-kun! This monja's perfect!
My monja mentor, huh? That does sound pretty\ncool!
Hey, don't you dare go around thinking you've\none-upped me, or you'll regret it!
Remember, you gotta treat me like a lady!
Well, it looks like it's cooked through.
Let's go ahead and eat Chef {NAME2}'s monja!
Sometimes chowing down on some monja just\nreally hits the spot, y'know?
Did you pick this out yourself? I really,\nreally like it!
I can tell you put a lot of thought\ninto this.
I'm so happy. Thank you. But you can bet\nI'll be giving you something just as good\nin return!
Oh, a present for me?
What a lovely surprise! Thanks!
Hey there, {NAME2}-kun.
I just came up with a great mocktail recipe.\nThing is, it might have too many steps to\nmake at the bar...
I want to take my time and do it justice,\nso can I make it at your place?
O-Oh, really? Great! Um, I'm looking forward\nto it...
Wait! We're just making mocktails! Th-That's\nall we're doing, okay!?
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize it was a big deal\nfor you. Whenever you're ready is fine!
Truth is, the mocktail stuff was mostly just\nan excuse.
I-I mean, I couldn't very well just be like\n"Hey, can I come over?"
It'd be weird!
It'd sound like I wanted something more...\nOr give you the wrong idea...
Especially when all I wanted was to see what\nyour place looked like..
Okay, that was almost too smooth. Are you\nsure you're younger than me?
Sometimes I feel like you've got me dancing\nin the palm of your hand...
Well, no, not really...
I, um, wanted to spend some quality time with\nyou as well.
Oh wait, you said your parents are out of the\ncountry now, right?
Which means... it's just us here. We're...\nalone!?
T-Time out for a sec! Let's save that for\nanother time, okay?
Ahem! Gotta pull myself together... I brought\neverything I need for the mocktails.
So it'd be a shame not to make some together.\nA nice drink sounds like a good place to\nstart...
Let's make some spectacular mocktails at your\nplace again today!
One, two, three, one, and...!
There's a woman juggling some bottles...\nIs she a street performer?
Hup! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Now, time for the\nfinisher!
I'm so sorry! I didn't think anyone was\nnearby!
The lid must've gotten loose. Thank goodness\nit's only water, but still, you're drenched!
You don't look fine! I'd feel bad making you\nwalk away like that.
It's really not! Maybe you could play it off\nif it was raining, but...
Oh no! What do I do!? I can't let a kid catch\na cold because of me!
I know! Come to my work! You can borrow a\ntowel and hang out until your clothes dry.
I'm really sorry about this! At least I\ndidn't get the inside of your bag wet.
Nice to meet you, {NAME2}-kun.
Oh, I was practicing some flair bartending\nmoves. I work here as a bartender.
You see all those bottles on the shelves?\nMy job is to make drinks with them.
And... Hup!
Flair bartending is the art of making drinks\nwhile performing like this.
You might think a bartender just has to shake\nup a mixer, but not always!
Sometimes bartending needs more oomph.\nThough I didn't mean for you to get a\nfirsthand taste of my practice...
Right. I'm not sure if this is much of an\napology, but I'd love to show you what it\n*should* look like.
Let's see. You're still underage, so let's go\nwith this, this... and maybe a little bit of\nthis?
Hup! One, two... and three!
Aaaand, here you go!
Oh, I wouldn't dare...! This is called a\nmocktail. It's nonalcoholic.
It's basically like juice.
Go on! Give it a taste.
Oh, that's perfect! I guess you have a bit of\na sweet tooth then?
Must be all the syrups I mixed in. They blend\ntogether well, right?
Huh, maybe that's because I used some tonic\nwater instead of club soda?
So, what did you think of my flair\nbartending?
After all this, I wouldn't mind hearing your\nimpression seeing it properly for the first\ntime.
R-Really? Hehe! All that practice to keep\nmyself looking composed paid off!
You've got a good eye, {NAME2}-kun. I did\ndraw inspiration from dance for that.
Oh, you thought I might drop it again?\nI guess I did splash water on you...
Hehe, thanks for the feedback! I'd love to\nperfect that trick from earlier someday.
Oh, of course! Feel free to come by whenever\nyou like.
Sure is. Come by whenever you like.
As long as you don't order any alcohol,\nminors are welcome here.
You can't stay too late, though. Follow those\nrules and you can come as often as you'd\nlike!
The owner may not be around all that much,\nbut they want to welcome customers who have\nto leave out the liquor too.
That's why we serve mocktails\u2014so that minors\nand nondrinkers can enjoy the atmosphere\nhere.
Hey, if I can ask a favor, would you like to\nbe my mocktail taste-tester?
I've been trying my hand at a bunch, but\ncould use a second opinion... Most people\nhere only order alcohol, you see.
H-How about it? Wait, I'll even throw in the\nrecipes for you so you can make them at home!
Really? Thank you!
I'll do my best to make some impressive\nmocktails for you, {NAME2}-kun.
And of course, I'll have some new tricks to\nshow you, too! Look forward to it.
Welcome. Oh, it's you! Glad to see you again,\n{NAME2}-kun.
Feel free to come by anytime. I'll be\nwaiting.
Come right in and take a seat. What should I\nmake you today?
Thanks for waiting!
Thank you! I try hard to create nice\ngradients like this.
Did the colors get your appetite going? It\ntastes as good as it looks too! ...Probably.
Of course! I'm sure it'll look amazing on\nyour socials. Make sure the bottle's in the\nshot!
Today's mocktail is called a Shirley Temple.\nThe name makes it sound like the real deal,\ndoesn't it?
Let me tell you a bit about it!
It's made with grenadine, or pomegranate\nsyrup for the base, and then you pour ginger\nale on top.
Finally, garnish with a lime and you're done!\nIt's about as classic a mocktail as they\ncome.
You just give it a little stir once it's all\nin the glass. It should be easy for you to\nmake at home too.
The fundamentals are important, you know? The\nowner here kept saying that when I was new.
Well, it's a little embarrassing...
I wasn't really much of a cocktail enthusiast\nback then, but I'd had a somewhat frustrating\nday...
So I told myself I'd drink my troubles away,\nand wandered right into a bar.
I was ready to chug down whatever they put\nin front of me, but what I got tasted\nincredible.
That's when I developed an interest in liquor\nitself.
The bartender that day put on a real show\nbefore handing me my drink.
The way the bottles flew through the air and\nthose graceful movements... I was mesmerized\nand pretty soon became a regular.
I was a college student then and wasn't\nthinking much about my future...
Once I needed to find a job, I started\nwondering if I could make drinks like that.
So I applied to become a bartender and\nstarted learning! That bartender I saw then\nis the owner here.
I'm still nowhere near that level, but I want\nto make others feel the way I did that day.
Hahaha. Saying this all out loud really is\nembarrassing, huh!
Hehe, thank you.
How about we go for round two? I'll make you\nsomething a little different.
C'mon, Yumi-chan! Show me that trick you\nalways do!
Hehe! All right, if that's what you want!
Hmph! Hup, hup! Heheh!
Wow, I never get tired of seeing you do that!\nYou're the best, Yumi-chan!
Hehe, thanks. Oh, {NAME2}-kun. Welcome.
I love watching Yumi-chan move. It's like\nshe's really dancing back there!
How do I put it? Her flair just seems so...\nelegant. She's mesmerizing.
Really, you two? Flattery's not gonna get you\nanywhere with me, okay?
Anyway, want one more, Rina-chan?
Oh, you know I do! But I have somewhere to be\nafter this. Maybe next time!
Thanks for coming by today. I know you just\n saw some flair, but I want to show you\nsomething else.
It's a move I wanted to show you the next\ntime you came by.
Ah, you noticed? That's right, I added a\nlittle step to the sequence there.
It's cramped behind the counter, but good\nfootwork opens up so many possibilities.
You're a perceptive one, {NAME2}-kun!
That's right. I incorporated more dance\nelements into my flair.
You see, I used to be in the dance club back\nwhen I was in college.
Let's see... I should have some videos on my\nphone.
Ah, this is from when I went to a competition\nwith my club. Here I am.
Our club did all kinds of dances. This one\nwas a belly dancing competition.
We all had to wear matching outfits and\npractice until we were in perfect sync.
Oh, those steps were a pain. It took sooo\nmuch practice to make them look good.
Right? I even sewed on those accessories\nmyself to accent the green shades of the\ndress.
Aww, you're going to make me blush! I didn't\nwant to ruin the mood by smiling.
It's great to hear feedback on my dancing\ntoo. It's been a while since I've even shown\nthis to anyone.
Thanks for watching, {NAME2}-kun.
I started dancing because I heard it helps\nyou keep in shape, but I just had so much\nfun.
I'd try my hand at every dance I could find.\nIt was all I could think about back then...
Those times were such a blast...
O-Oh! Sorry! You must be bored hearing me\ndrone on and on about myself.
Mocktails! Yeah, let's talk about mocktails!
I was thinking of making you one more. What\ndo you want? Anything's on the menu for\ntoday!
Any flavors or colors you'd fancy? That's the\nbest place to start.
Roger that! In that case, I'll use this,\na little of that, and...
Hmph! Upsy... daisy!
Almost... there...!
Mmmph!
Oh! {NAME2}-kun! Fancy meeting you here.
Oh, this? The guy we have deliver drinks and\nother supplies took the day off.
I thought I'd at least buy what we need for\ntoday, but I guess I got too much.
Wait, really? This stuff is pretty heavy,\nyou know.
You'd be willing to help carry some of this\nfor me?
Phew, that should do it! Thanks so much for\nhelping out, {NAME2}-kun.
You sure it wasn't too heavy? It felt like my\narms were about to fall off.
Seriously? Wow, I guess young guys like you\nare pretty strong...
I knew it. Still, thanks for carrying it all\nthe way here.
Haha! I guess even you make jokes every now\nand then, {NAME2}-kun.
Okay! Let me make you a drink. Consider it\nthanks for the help.
Thanks for waiting! Today's mocktail is a\npeach tea.
So long as it looks like a cocktail and it's\nnon-alcoholic, it's a mocktail!
At least, that's how I see it. Look, it's\neven got some garnishing like cocktails do!
I thought you'd like something refreshing\nafter working up a sweat. Come on, try it.
Hehe, judging by your face, that was right up\nyour alley, huh?
You just add iced tea to some peach syrup and\nstir! Yup! It's that easy!
Then again, I did put a bit of extra syrup at\nthe base to make it more like a cocktail.
I also added the garnish on the brim of the\nglass. Layers really do help make a drink\npop.
I'm the kind of gal who needs a sweet\npick-me-up when I'm tired, so I made it a\nlittle sweeter.
But when I'm exhausted, I'll sometimes switch\nthe flavor up with some jasmine tea.
You can also use rooibos tea instead of\nblack tea as another variation.
I'm sure you'll be able to come up with your\nown takes on the recipe, {NAME2}-kun.
So yeah, that's the recipe. Oh, right.
Since you're here, want something to eat?\nI could make you some pasta with those\ngroceries we carried here.
Hup! Hah!
Wow, impressive as ever!
You're amazing, Yumi-chan!
Hehe! But wait till you see... this!
No way! You caught that!
You rock! You're the best, Yumi-chan!
Hehe, hope you enjoyed the flair.
How could we not! You're sooo cool,\nYumi-chan! I could watch you bartend for,\nlike, ever!
Thanks. You know me. I always aim to please.
You're a pro, Shiina-chan! It was like\nwatching a show. It's not just me, right?
Totally. I'd say she could even make it as a\ndancer.
True! Wow, I'd love to see Yumi-chan up on\nstage!
H-Haha... Sorry, Rina-chan. I'm just a\nbartender.
Hm? Oh, did you try out the recipe from the\nother day at home?
How did it taste? Did it go okay?
Heh, I'm glad to hear! I'll come up with\nanother recipe for you.
Haha, right? Even if you're just mixing\ningredients, nailing the proportions can be\ntough!
My, aren't you confident! Have you mastered\nthe craft already?
I just got an idea. How do you feel about\nmaking it here for me?
I want to see just how good you are!
Oooh, look at you! You're getting the hang\nof it!
That's... not really what you say at a bar.\nStill, you're getting the hang of it!
Okay, now let me give this a sip!
Wow! This is perfectly mixed!
But I feel like it tastes just a little\ndifferent. Did you use a new base?
R-Really?
Yeah, I guess I did mention how jasmine tea's\ngood for that.
Wha!? Worried? O-Oh... I made you worry, huh?
Thanks, {NAME2}-kun. You're a really kind\nperson. That makes me happy.
So you noticed how I felt and managed to put\ntogether a drink to lift my mood?
Looks like you could be a bartender yourself,\nkid! Just kidding.
Still, I really appreciate this.
For you to grasp my emotions so easily\ntells me that I've still got ways to go as a\nbartender.
Those customers earlier... they were saying\nthat I could become a dancer.
It made me wish I could've become one. Even\nthough I was the one who gave up on dancing.
Yeah. If I'm being honest, it's not like I\ndidn't want to keep going.
Sure, I wasn't confident I could go pro, but\nI could've kept on dancing as a hobby.
But I quit. I had some bad experiences when\nI was in dance, you see.
I mean, I just wanted to be able to enjoy\ndoing what I liked, but...
Oh, sorry for making this about me again.\nI know I'm being a drag.
Thanks for the mocktail! Guess I'm up next.\nOkay, I better focus. Can't let you beat me!
Oh, {NAME2}-kun! Welcome!
Well, the owner came by and left this here.
It's a small-scale tournament. Or I guess\nit's more like a gathering for flair\nbartenders?
Everyone gets to show off their skills and\noriginal cocktails.
If you win, your recipe gets featured at this\npretty big bar for a while.
I should be able to take part, but...
Haha, I don't know about that. There are\nloads of better bartenders out there.
You really are perceptive,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
I'm sure it'll be fun. Oh, but only adults\nare allowed in. I wonder if it'll be\nstreamed?
It's not like the owner was telling me to\nenter this or anything...
But it feels like he's expecting big things\nfrom me, you know? Leaving this here and all.
Well, how do I put it? I do like flair\nbartending and coming up with recipes, but...
Do you mind if I sit next to you?
So, I mentioned before how I used to enjoy\ndancing, right? Well, I got really into it.
I didn't care about getting in shape or\nanything back then. I just wanted to have fun\nand make friends.
That's one flimsy motivation, I know. But I\nthink that's why I could keep at it.
The club itself was pretty chill too. More of\na "let's enjoy dance" vibe than anything.
We did enter competitions but we didn't care\nabout winning or losing.
We just saw it as our chance to practice and\nshow off what we could do.
The results didn't matter\u2014although we sure\nworked our butts off to perfect our moves.
But then, one day...
We were in some competition, and then someone\nin the audience complained about me.
I made a mistake I'd made in a previous\ncompetition, and I guess that made him blow\nhis top.
I got told that I must not have been taking\nit seriously, that I shouldn't be repeating\nthe same mistakes.
He kept complaining on and on, even though\nI was just dancing for fun.
But this guy... I guess he got obsessed?\nHe kept coming to events to criticize me.
He had his own image of how I should dance,\nthen whined when I let him down. I couldn't\nstand it.
He's the reason why dancing stopped being fun\nfor me.
All the fun had been sucked out of it, so I\nwanted to drink my worries away... and ended\nup here.
I quit dancing... But I'd found a new joy in\nbartending.
Sorry about that. I ended up going on another\nheavy tangent...
Long story short, I guess you can say\ncompeting isn't really my thing.
I like it when others watch me, but not when\nthey judge me. So maybe this tournament isn't\nfor me.
No, thank you for listening.
No, it's okay. It's all in the past now and\nit's not that serious anyway.
Hearing that from you makes me feel a little\nbetter.
Actually, you might be the first person I've\ntold all that to. Wow, that's kinda\nembarrassing!
Okay! Time to prepare you another mocktail as\nthanks for today.
Oh, {NAME2}-kun. Good to see you.
Oh, did you already have plans? Come by again\nwhen you're free.
And that's how you do it. What do you think?\nHope you'll try this one out yourself.
Hi there, welcome...
Heh. No other customers today, huh?
Fine by me. Hey, gimme my usual. Chop-chop.
I-I'm sorry, sir... I believe you've been\ntold that you're banned from this store.
Banned!? Maybe according to you, but who died\nand put you in charge!?
There's no law keeping me from coming here!\nThe customer always comes first!
Eek!
Huh!? What'd you just say, brat!?
Ugh, isn't this supposed to be a bar? When'd\nit turn into a soda fountain for kids?
Didn't you hear me, lady? I told you to make\nme my usual!
S-Sir! I told you you're...
Fine. I'll leave for today.
I'm sorry about that, {NAME2}-kun...
That's the guy. The one who made me quit\ndancing.
Back when I had graduated college, given up\ndancing, and just started to enjoy my\nbartending training...
...he found out that I worked here and\nstarted coming by all the time.
I could only do simple flair tricks back\nthen, so he'd always complain about that.
He'd even bring up how other stores had\nbetter cocktails. It was awful.
The owner was pretty quick to ban him though.\nI thought he wouldn't come back...
I'm sorry. You took the time to come here,\nand now I'm talking to you about my life\nstory again.
That must've been scary for you. He looked\nready to snap at any moment.
You're one tough kid, you know that? Thanks,\nI feel a lot better now.
Me? I'm... If I'm being honest, I was\nterrified.
You said it. We told him he's banned, but\nthat didn't do a lick of good.
Thank you. I would've been too afraid to do\nanything on my own.
I'm so glad you were here with me,\n{NAME2}-kun.
I should tell the owner about this. I just\nhope it doesn't lead to any trouble.
It's not like the police will help if all\nhe's done is enter the store.
Everything worked out okay because you were\nhere, but what if he comes again?
Maybe I should just give up... on\neverything...
That might make things easier for me...
Huh? Why do you ask?
Y-You're not planning on doing anything\ndangerous, are you?
Okay... Well, he'd always lambaste other\ndancers before he got obsessed with me.
From what I know, he's pretty infamous in the\ndance scene. You might even find blog posts\nfrom his other victims.
I think his name was... Atsushi Takayama.
That's the name he'd sign on his bills here.
You have to promise me you won't do anything\ndangerous, though. Okay?
Wrong, wrong, stupid, wrong! Ohhh, nothin's\nbetter than teachin' those girls a lesson!\nI'll put 'em in their places!
They're learnin' howta survive in a cutthroat\nsociety thanks to me! They oughta be\ngrateful!
What a nasty fellow, trying to force his\ngoodwill onto others. Ready, Wonder?
Why? I was just teachin' 'em a lesson... that\nfixin' your mistakes leads to victory...
So I was the one making all the mistakes...\nI wasn't able to see that they didn't want\nmy help.
The target should be\nin this area.
Stay alert.
I can sense Takayama from here...
You ready for a fight?
Oh, welcome!
So... I know this is going to sound too good\nto be true, but that guy came by to\napologize.
He contacted the owner about it. I was too\nscared to be there, though.
From what I heard, it was like he was a\ndifferent person and took full\naccountability.
He said he'd ask for forgiveness from the\nothers too. Sounds like he's traumatized a\nlot of people.
He even said he'd turn himself in because\nhe's sure he must've broken the law from\nstalking people.
At first, I thought it was a lie to get me to\ndrop my guard before he'd start grilling me\nagain.
But maybe it's not. I still have my\nsuspicions, but at least it's over with.
Anyway, enough depressing talk! I hope you'll\nhelp taste-test more drinks for me today.
Hup, hup! Hah! One, two, three...
Aaand done! Phew...
Hehe, enjoy!
Thanks. I'll do my best to incorporate your\nfeedback into my next recipe.
Oh, there's one thing I needed to ask.
You did something, didn't you? About\nall this.
I can tell. The timing's just too perfect.\nHe was so mad last time, you know?
But now he admitted his guilt, like he was a\ndifferent person. And that was all... after\nyou found out about this.
Don't look so troubled. It's not like I'm\nangry with you.
No need to explain yourself. Seems like you'd\nprefer to not talk about it anyway.
But I do want you to tell me one thing.
{NAME2}, you didn't do anything dangerous,\nright? I'd feel awful if something ever\nhappened to you.
Glad to hear it! But let me know if you got\nhurt, okay?
Then I can help patch you up, at least.
Well, I guess you're not badly hurt or\nanything if you're here now...
Oh, come on!
Don't be so reckless! You're still just\na kid!
In any case, I won't ask exactly what it is\nthat you did, but...
Thank you.
So, listen. I really, really don't want you\ngetting hurt or anything.
Because, well... I...
I see you... as someone really important\nto me!
What about you? I know I shouldn't be asking\nyou this...
Wh-When you say that, do you... did you\nreally mean it that way?
Really? Like, for sure? I mean, I'm a good\nbit older than you.
Ugh... You're a real devil, you know that?
Agh! And I'm supposed to be more mature\nthan you!
Umm, so...
I'd like it if we were still together by the\ntime you can drink legally...
I really hope that... you'll stick with me\ntill then...
R-Right! Wow, you respect me as your mocktail\ninstructor that much, huh?
Of course that's what you meant! Guess I'll\njust have to keep teaching you!
Hehe. But really, don't force yourself,okay?\nI'd love for you to keep coming here.
Okay, what should I make next? Maybe\nsomething minty?
Woohoohoo...
Hrmmm... I think this is the pick for good\nplum wine... It's got a better flavor...
Dry gin, though... Oh, I'd never let you go!
Urgh... Sorry you had to see that.
Ow... I've got a headache, all right.
I wasn't drinking away my worries or anything\nagain. I was just having a little taste...
Remember that flyer I showed you? About the\nbartender competition?
I'm gonna enter it.
Part of the judging involves me making and\nsubmitting an original cocktail...
So I did some recipe-testing and gave them\na little sip. And may have gotten a little\ntipsy...
It's not like I could have you try these out.\nThey've got alcohol in them!
Hahaha... See? Drinking too much is\ndangerous.
I've realized that I don't really have the\ndrive to win this thing, you know?
It's more like I just want people to see\nwhat I can do. Just like back when I danced,\nI guess...
I want to show them what I'm capable of now.\nI want to prove myself.
And it'll give me new goals to aim for!\nI can't wait to see all of the competitors'\namazing tricks and try them out too!
I know it might be disrespectful to enter\nthis competition when I'm not trying\nto win...
But still... I want to try. Thank you,\n{NAME2}-kun.
You've done so much for me. Because of my\ntalks with you, I was able to take a step\nforward.
You've helped me improve my cocktails,\nmy mocktails, and even my flair tricks.
So I really should thank you!
Agh, I'm out of water already...
Wait, really!? Yesss! I get to have a\nmocktail from {NAME2}-kun!
Don't mind if I do...
*glug glug glug*
Ah... Wow, it's sooo tasty! You've gotten\nsooo much better, {NAME2}-kun!
Hehehe... Guess I can't sit on my laurels.\nI'll have to keep working on my skills too!
Oh? You're on, then! No way I'll let myself\nlose to you!
R-Really!? You think so? You're making me\nblush...
What, nuh-uh! You should be saying "way to\ngo, me!"
I'm proud of you! Keep up the good work!
Hehe, this is really tasty, y'know...?
Hey, {NAME2}-kun? Could you come sit next\nto me?
It's fun talking face-to-face... but right\nnow, I want you by my side.
I mean, I'm probably all flush right now, so\nit's kinda embarrassing to face you\ndirectly...
W-Wow...! Y'know, you shouldn't tease your\nelders!
B-But... I'll forgive you this once...
Welcome! Oh, {NAME2}-kun!
Hey, do you have a minute? I wanted to tell\nyou something.
Oh... Okay! Talk to you next time.
So I entered that competition... And the\nresults are in...
I didn't win.
Yeah, I know how much you were rooting for\nme. Sorry to let you down.
Thanks! I might've lost, but it was still a\nworthwhile experience!
Yeah! Of course.
I gave it my all. I think my cocktail turned\nout pretty good too.
It's just that the other bartenders were even\nbetter. So sure, I might've lost...
But I got to see so many flair tricks and\ncocktails I'd never have thought of.
There was so much for me to absorb and learn!\nHow do I put it...
I feel like a plant that's just been watered\nafter a long time!
Yeah! Watch me! I'm gonna keep growing!
I have so many tricks and drinks I want to\nlearn. I'm gonna do my best to take them\nall on!
So... while we're on this topic, there's a\nnew drink I wanted you to try, {NAME2}-kun.
I'll get it ready right away.\nJust hold on a second.
Hup! Then we do... this!
And here you are.
Just give it a taste. I'm confident in\nthis one.
Looks like I don't need to ask. Your face\nsays it all.
That was what I performed at the competition.
I combined all my favorite dance moves to\nmake my own signature flair.
It's the best flair bartending show I\ncould do.
The same goes for that drink. It's my own\nsignature blend.
Oh, I didn't put alcohol in it. You don't\nhave to worry.
Call it a Yumi Special: Mocktail Edition.\nHehe.
Haha! That's the best compliment a bartender\ncan get.
Actually, I... made that drink with you\nin mind.
I was thinking up new cocktails, but I kept\nthinking of you.
The drink that best expresses me as I am now\njust has to involve you somehow!
But... Hahaha...
I'm kinda embarrassed now showing it to you!\nStill, I'm glad you enjoyed it!
I'll make you one with alcohol once you're\nold enough.
So look forward to it getting even more\nflavorful, {NAME2}-kun!
By the way... can I ask you something?
Once you're old enough to drink, I want to be\nthe one to make your first.
I want that drink to be this mocktail, but as\na cocktail, with alcohol in it.
Is that okay?
Great! I was so worried you'd say no!
That's a promise, okay? You can't take it\nback now\u2014never ever!
Hehe.
But I guess it'll still be a while till you\ncan drink, huh, {NAME2}-kun?
So until then, you'll be tasting lots and\nlots of my mocktails, okay?
Here's to the years to come!
Thank you...!
Hu\u2014 Uh\u2014 What?
{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Shiina and I hung out\nin Shibuya. We spent a while\nin an arcade.

Sounds like Yumi wants to\nmake mocktails with me.\nI should head over...
Shiina and I hung out at the\nplanetarium. We learned about\nsome seasonal constellations.

Maybe another time...
Yumi and I went back\nto my place.
Yumi and I made tasty\nmocktails at my place. It was\na drink to remember...
I got soaked from\nhead to toe...
The woman took me to\nwhere she works.
Shiina moves with the grace\nof a dancer despite the tight\nspace behind the bartop!
I wonder if Shiina's flair\nbartending skills stems\nfrom her Proficiency...
Also, it'd be nice to learn\nmore about mocktails to\nget better at Cooking.
Spending time with Shiina,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
I feel my bond with Shiina\ngrowing deeper...
After telling her my\nthoughts on her mocktails,\nI left the bar...
Shiina's wearing a dazzling\noutfit as she dances with zeal\non the screen.
After Shiina taught me\nabout a new mocktail,\nI left the bar...
I dug into Shiina's impromptu\npasta while nursing\nthe mocktail.
Shiina is flair bartending\nagain. The bar patrons seem\nreally impressed.
Shiina's less talkative\nthan usual...
I try to remember the recipe\nShiina taught me.
I made a mocktail for Shiina.
I made Shiina a mocktail,\nand she taught me how to\nmake a new one in return...
It mentions some kind of competition for\nflair bartenders.
He must have bled out every\ndrop of her desire to dance...
Shiina made me a mocktail.\nIt felt like it kind of tasted\nmore bitter than usual.
Shiina's desire is waning...
The banned customer's name\nis Atsushi Takayama. I should\nsee if he's in Mementos.
After Shiina closed the\nstore early, I walked her to\nthe station.
Atsushi Takayama seems to\nhave had a change of heart.\nI should check on Shiina...
Shiina's movements seem\neven smoother than before...
I learned some mocktail tips\nfrom Shiina.
I sense a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Shiina.
I should choose my\nnext words carefully...
I'm now in a relationship\nwith Yumi...
Yumi and I spent time alone\ntogether as she made me\nmocktails...
Shiina made me a new mocktail.
Seems like she's drunk...
I should get her some water.
Seems like she's still\na little drunk...
Shiina was still a bit\ntipsy, so I made some\nmore mocktails for her.
I spent time alone with a\ndrunk Yumi... After walking\nher back, I headed home too.
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Shiina...
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Yumi...
I savored the mocktail\nShiina made for me to\nmy heart's content...
I shared a special moment\nwith Yumi.
Would you mind if I took a moment of\nyour time?
You have my sincerest gratitude. Now then...
Hmm... I ask that you please do visit, if you\nso desire.
Heheh, it appears that you would like my\nassistance with something.
Could it have something to do with Naruru!?
{PLAYER_NAME}-sama, you've arrived.
There is a proposal I wish to discuss\nwith you.
I apologize for the inconvenience. Please,\nfollow me.
Thank you for coming today.
Please consider this space a reception area.\nMaster has authorized its use.
As you know, it is my role to serve as your\nconcierge.
I must support you as you undergo Master's\ntrial of desire, as is my duty.
Therefore, in order for me to understand you\nbetter...
...I seek your cooperation in an agreement\nof sorts.
I merely seek your responses to my questions\nand requests.
I must acquire knowledge of you and human\ndesire in thorough detail.
You have my gratitude. Now then...
Let us begin with my first inquiry.
Are you an idol?
I have been studying the complexities of\nyour world.
And it is my understanding that idols are\ncharming, multifaceted individuals.
As a possessor of multiple Personas,\nI perceive you in a similar nature.
Excuse the clich\xe9, but where do you see\nyourself in a few years? Please explain your\ndesires for the future.
I presume the two are quite different. Which\nis your true desire?
Then please take the opportunity to do so.\nSurely this is a decision you cannot ignore.
A reasonable degree? Could you describe that\nmore precisely? I wish for a clear answer.
Hm. In short, you are still trying to find\nyourself.
In which case, if I may be so bold, I will\nupgrade our agreement to a special contract.
I would like you to bring the Persona I\nspecify back here to me.
As I told you before, a Persona is a part of\none's personality.
I believe my image of you may be further\nfleshed out by a look at your Persona.
Wait, my apologies. Such a task must be mere\nchild's play for you.
This will allow me to better understand you\nand thus provide you more effective support.
I believe this is what humans call a\n"win-win."
That shall be all for today. I hope our\nspecial contract proves fruitful.
In doing so, I may better support you. Are\nyou amenable to this agreement?
Oh? {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have brought\nthe Persona I requested.
I take it you are eager to fulfill our\ncontract.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but please\ncome this way.
With the Persona you have brought, I have\ncome to understand you further.
Just as I expected...
Similar to what my master has told you of\nthis realm, this very room is a reflection\nof yourself.
Therefore, bringing a new Persona here will\nexpand your own potential as well.
Please be aware that the functions of the\nVelvet Room have now been upgraded.
Well then...
Our contract is proving fruitful.\nI understand you more deeply than before.
However, I am not yet satisfied. So I shall\nask you another question.
Have you ever considered that you yourself\nresemble an idol?
It is my duty to understand you. I shall ask\nas many times as necessary.
Is that so? It is quite evident to me that\nyou possess such qualities.
If they allow me to understand you, I shall\nsay I do not hate them.
I hear idols possess several distinct faces.\nIn short, they don various "masks."
If idols indeed possess multiple Personas\nlike you, there is much we can learn\nfrom them.
Therefore, I would like us to study idols\ntogether.
I take it we are in agreement.
I am pleased that you are amenable to the\nconditions of our contract.
I do aim for this to be a mutually beneficial\narrangement. A win-win, as you call it.
Now allow me to state my next request.
That will be all. I appreciate your continued\ncooperation.
I see you are eager to fulfill our contract.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but please\nfollow me.
I feel I now understand you better. As your\nconcierge, I am truly grateful.
Our contract is proceeding smoothly,\nbut there is something I would like to\nconfirm with you.
Please watch carefully.
I would like you to make these poses.
I implore you to try. For your sake, I must\nconfirm that you can do this.
I do appreciate your directness, but please\nreconsider.
With this pose, a young girl changed\nher fate...
...and rose to stardom as an idol.
I believe this pose may be highly beneficial\nto you and your efforts to escape ruin.
This is my hope for you, as your concierge.\nNow please, begin whenever you are ready.
Forgive my audacity, but please adjust the\nangle of your feet.
We cannot reap the full benefits unless your\npositioning is perfect.
As I expected of you, {PLAYER_NAME}-sama.\nYou learn quickly.
But surely you can aim even higher. Please\ncopy each of these poses perfectly.
Come. It is time to unleash your potential.
You've recreated every pose perfectly.\nWithout any rehearsal for that matter.
You have gone far beyond my expectations.\nSurely, you must feel it too.
Yes. There is talent within you!
Thank you for posing for me. I have no\nfurther poses to request of you at present.
I assumed it would be too soon for you to\ntake on my next assignment, but seeing as\nyou mastered the posing so skillfully...
I would like to continue with the next step\nof our contract.
That is all. Thank you for your continued\ncooperation.
You must be eager to fulfill our contract.
My apologies for the trouble, but please\nfollow me.
I suggest we take our business on-site to\nachieve the most effective results.
I apologize for the short notice, but I ask\nthat you accompany me.
As you must already know, this is Akihabara.\nI understand it to be a gathering place\nfor idols.
At present, this town is a battlefield. Idols\nare present everywhere.
As I said the other day, all of this is to\nfurther augment your strength.
Our goal is to observe and grasp what exactly\nan idol is.
Moreover, I surmise this may further draw out\nyour Personas' powers.
Now, let us make first contact.
We're holding a concert at the local theater\ntoday! Come check us out!
Pardon me. I have a few questions.
Huh? Oh, sure. The theater is right past that\ncorner over\u2014
What is your group name? How many members\nare there? What is your signature color? What\nkinds of merchandise do you offer?
What? Huh? Ummm...
I hear that idols host photo sessions. Does\nyour unit do the same?
At these events, how do you interact with\nfans? Do you offer anything beyond photos?
T-The details are on this flyer! Have a\nnice day!
What's with that lady? Is she one of those\nwild fans?
I see. I assume that by running away, they\nincite their fans to give chase.
My assessment was accurate. Idols are indeed\nprofoundly interesting.
This requires further analysis. Now,\nwhat next?
*gasp* That girl.
We're open! Please visit our caf\xe9!
I have decided. That girl will be our next\nsubject.
Have a flyer! We're running a concept caf\xe9!
A concept caf\xe9? Are you not an idol?
Oh, our caf\xe9's theme is idols! I guess that\nkind of makes me one.
Understood. Permit me to ask a few\nidol-related questions, if you will.
Um... Sure, go ahead.
What is your name? Are you in a unit? What\nis your member color? What should I\ncall you?
Do you hold concerts? Photo sessions? What\nabout autograph sessions and such?
I am always composed. Though perhaps I was a\nbit too eager.
Ah, forgive me. Perhaps, I was a bit\novereager.
Was there a time limit?
Ah, I can see how it is a breach of\netiquette to hold a long conversation\nwithout compensation.
Hahaha! You're funny.
Feel free to stop by the caf\xe9 and have\na chat!
Squee...!
"Squee"?
Such extraordinary talent. You are the ideal\nidol that I seek.
{PLAYER_NAME}-sama. Please think of her\nas your role model.
Ah, it's already this late!?
Sorry, I have to go! I hope to see you two at\nthe caf\xe9!
How unfortunate. I wanted you to observe your\nrole model for a little longer.
Why, of course. Well... perhaps I cannot say\nthat truthfully.
What? Why would I desire that?
That Narumi girl stirs such strong emotions\nwithin me... Just what is this feeling?
A fan... So this is how it feels.
The Cat's Claw concept caf\xe9... If we pay a\nvisit, we'll surely meet her again.
I shall invite you there next time.
I am sure it will be beneficial for you to\nlearn from her about idols.
In any case, let us proceed with the next\nphase of our special contract.
Let us part ways for today. I appreciate your\ncontinued cooperation.
You appear eager to fulfill our contract.
Incidentally, do you recall our promise?
I know you have not forgotten. We are meant\nto visit the concept caf\xe9, or "con caf\xe9,"\nif you will.
Yes. The "con caf\xe9," for short. Well\nremembered.
I do apologize for the short notice, but I\nhope that you will accompany me.
Hello! Welcome to The Cat's Claw Caf\xe9!
Oh, didn't I meet you two the other day?
I'm honored that you remember. We have come\nto patronize your establishment.
Yay, I'm so happy! Thanks for coming!
Right this way please!
So, what can I get you?
I have researched con caf\xe9 etiquette. Allow\nme to demonstrate.
I request an order of the "Gimme Your Love\u266a\nFave Omelette Rice."
I hope it will be sufficient to convey my\nlove for you, Naruru.
Great! One order of Fave Omelette Rice!
As I mentioned, that was standard con caf\xe9\netiquette.
Ordering omelette rice from one's "fave" is\nthe most basic of basic rules of conduct.
Thanks for waiting! Here is your Fave\nOmelette Rice!
What's your name, miss?
I am Merope.
Got it! So... Who's your favorite,\nMerope-chan?
Naruru!
That's right! Everyone's number-one fave,\nNarumi Nashimoto, Naruru\u266a
This is an idol's basic introductory call and\nresponse.
We may be her only audience at present,\nbut please note that Naruru gives her all no\nmatter what.
Behold her brilliant smile, her pure voice,\nher gaze that unshakably meets my own...
Her performance has an irresistible charm.
I believe that there are countless items on\nthis menu that embody Naruru's charm.
For the sake of your personal growth, we must\nsample them all.
I knew you would understand. Con caf\xe9 idols\nare indisputably sophisticated.
I ask that you have faith in my discerning\neye. It is second to none.
I cannot deny your claim, but I believe this\ntoo is a win-win situation.
To aid in your development, we will require\nthe Head Over Heels Lovey-Dovey Lemonade.
I would also like the Love Stack Pancakes and\nthe Cutie Cat Strawberry Parfait.
Wow, thank you so much!
Oh! As thanks for ordering so much...
That's a ticket for a picture with me at my\nnext photo session!
These are usually just for regulars, but\nyou're special.
Squee!
I've heard much about the fabled fan photo\nticket. It is finally mine.
Oops, I'm sorry! Excuse me one second.
Hello? Big Sis here.
You're hungry? I'm sorry. Look, there's some\nleftover food I got from work in the fridge,\nokay?
Ah! That was not proper of me.
I was overcome by emotion. I apologize.
At any rate, I believe Naruru is a truly\nsuperb role model for you.
In order to best aid your personal growth by\nlearning the ways of the idol...
We must attend this photo session.
In any case, let us proceed with the next\nclause of our special contract.
Thanks for waiting! Here's your lemonade,\npancakes, and parfait.
It would seem I have ordered too much. Please\nhelp me finish this food.
Let us part ways for today. I am grateful for\nyour continued cooperation.
Do you recall our earlier promise?
Please do not feign forgetfulness. Naturally,\nI am referring to Naruru's photo session.
Indeed. I am glad that you remember.
I apologize for the short notice, but I\nrequest that you accompany me.
A photo with one's idol is a momentous\noccasion. It requires due diligence.
It is vital that one make an effort to avoid\nneedlessly burdening their idol.
According to my research, it is helpful to\nprepare concise questions that they can\nbuild upon.
Time is limited after all, and our discussion\nmust conclude in a proper fashion.
Indeed. Just as idols have tacit\nrestrictions, fans must follow their own\ncode of conduct as well.
Of course. Just as idols work to hone\ntheir skills, fans should put forth an effort\nas well.
You may leave it to me. As Naruru's fan,\nI have prepared well in advance.
It is fascinating how idols and fans share\nsuch a special connection.
There is much to learn from them both.
Next in line please!
At last. Allow me to demonstrate to you a\nflawless fan meeting interaction.
Naturally, I am prepared for all\npossibilities.
To deepen my understanding of idols,\nI have taken the liberty to visit the caf\xe9 in\nmy own time.
Come. I ask that you observe my conversation\nwith Naruru.
Ah, Merope-chan! Thanks so much for coming!
Why, I would not dare miss it. After all,\nyou are my one and only, Naruru.
Thanks! I'm really glad to see you.
Naruru, I read that your favorite food is\npudding. Is that true?
Yes, I love pudding!
Merope-chan? What's wrong?
Ah, it is nothing... Such lovely weather we\nare having...
Haha! Where'd that come from? You're always\nso funny, Merope!
Hurry it up! Don't just favor the women!
Her time is way up! Send her packin'!
Tch... Hurry it up!
Forgive me. I am aware that to make other\nfans wait is a breach of etiquette.
I'm so sorry. You even saved up all these\ntickets.
I do not mind. More importantly, I'd like a\nphoto with you, Naruru.
Of course! Let's take a cute one!
So this is how it feels to take a photo with\nyour idol. I am remarkably moved.
This is why I can't get hyped for you,\nNaruru!
As a fan, I expect to see more of a serious\neffort from you!
R-Right... Um, sorry.
And don't be so mousy either! It's like you\nhave no passion!
You gotta reel fans in! You'll never rise to\nstardom just waiting around!
Yes, you're absolutely right. I'll try much\nharder from now on!
Exactly. Glad you understand. While we're at\nit, another thing...
Her ability to tolerate such unreasonable\ndemands and still keep a smile is\ncommendable.
However, I can only bear to watch for\nso long.
That is enough, ruffian.
Huh? What's your problem! Get lost! It's my\nturn now!
I can no longer ignore your misconduct.\nIt brings shame to all of us fans.
You have no right to call yourself a fan of\nNaruru. I ask that you leave.
Merope-chan!
Screw that! It's you who's gotta go!
Now what!? You people need to get your shit\ntogether!
No, YOU do!
You're the problem! You're always so mean\nto Naruru!
You go overtime more than anyone else!
Bully Naruru again and you'll have to deal\nwith us!
What the hell!? Shit!
Thank you, everyone. This is how true Naruru\nfans should be.
You two were awesome!
That guy annoyed us, but we were too afraid\nto stand up to him.
The staff wouldn't do anything about him\nsince he's a paying customer.
Everyone... I'm sorry for the trouble, but\nthank you for looking out for me!
NA-RU-RU! NA-RU-RU!
And thank you both for coming to my rescue!
Think nothing of it. As your fan, I refuse to\ntolerate such behavior.
All things considered, our first photo\nsession has been most rewarding.
I am grateful for your assistance today.
Now, let us proceed with the next phase of\nour special contract.
I appreciate your eagerness to fulfill our\ncontract.
{PLAYER_NAME}-sama, I would like us to\npay another visit to the land of idols.
Do not feign ignorance. I refer to Naruru's\nplace of employment.
Excellent, {PLAYER_NAME}-sama. I see you\ntoo have become a fine Naruru fan.
I apologize for the short notice, but I hope\nthat you will accompany me.
Welcome! Ah, it's Merope-san and her friend!
Pardon me, where is Naruru? I believe her\nshift is today.
I'm sorry. Narumi-chan said she'll be a\nbit late.
She should be here soon. Would you like to\ncome back later?
No, that is fine. We will wait inside.
Understood! Right this way.
Hi, you two! I'm so sorry! My other job ran\ntoo long.
It was no trouble at all.
But I am surprised to hear that you are\nworking two jobs. You appear to be rather\nfatigued.
Haha. I can't hide anything from you,\nMerope-chan.
I am well aware that prying into an idol's\npersonal life is taboo.
However, I am worried for you, Naruru.
Merope-chan...
If you do not mind, might I inquire about\nyour situation?
Thank you, Merope-chan. I don't mind\ntelling you.
The truth is, my family isn't very well-off.\nHonestly, we're flat broke.
That's why I need to work to support us all.
At first, I applied to this caf\xe9 because I\nheard the pay was good.
As I kept at it though, I started to enjoy\nbeing an idol.
I love making our guests happy. It isn't just\nabout the money.
Everyone's support for me as an idol has\ntaught me to love myself more.
Naruru...
But my family can't live on this pay alone,\nso I have to work multiple jobs.
To be honest, this is hard for me to admit.
It doesn't feel right to beg my fans for\nsympathy.
Yeah, it is. My sister is still young, so I\nhave to do my best for her.
Thank you, but it's nothing that impressive.
Still, I'll take that over pity any day.
Oh, don't misunderstand though. I don't want\nyou to spend more money on me or anything!
I know idols rely on their fans' financial\nsupport, but...
If you're spending out of pity and not\nenjoying yourselves, then I can't call myself\nan idol!
Your dignity in the face of such hardship is\nadmirable.
Naruru, you really are my one true idol.
Haha. Thank you, Merope-chan.
Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to\nkeep working here much longer.
There's this awful event they're planning...
What kind of event, Naruru?
Ah, Producer!
Naruru! One omelette rice for this table,\nthank you!
Uh, yes, coming!
I'm sorry, we're really busy today.
I've got to work even harder since I came in\nlate. I hope you enjoy yourselves!
Naruru, that's too much time at one table.\nYou gotta multitask better, 'kay?
Yes, I'll be more careful.
There is a line outside. As fellow fans, we\nmust be considerate.
Those must be Naruru's coworkers.
Break's over. Guess we should head back.
Ugh, I don't wanna! The pay sucks ass.
The producer is such a jerk. He still hasn't\ngiven us our back pay!
If it was just us, I could deal. We barely\ntry anyway.
But Narumi's busting her ass, and he still\nkeeps most of her paycheck.
Excuse me. May I have a moment?
Huh? Oh, you're Narumi-chan's fans!
Crap, did you just hear all that?
Please, tell us more.
We promise to keep it to ourselves,\nof course.
Like we were saying, the problem is our\ncaf\xe9's producer.
The dude takes pretty much everything\nwe earn.
You mean he is not compensating you idols\nfairly?
Yep. Con caf\xe9s are way more expensive than\nmost places, right?
That's because there's a fee for our services\nincluded in the price.
That money would normally be included in\nour wages.
But at our shop the producer takes most of it\nfor himself.
Huh? Beats me... We're clueless about all\nthat complicated stuff.
For con caf\xe9s, I believe that kind of extra\npay is largely at the discretion of the shop.
In short, as long as workers are paid the\nminimum wage set by law, there is no grounds\nfor legal recourse in most cases.
I don't really get it, but wow! You really\nknow a lot!
I am well-versed in idol culture and\ncon caf\xe9s.
Anyway, that's why our management is the\nabsolute worst.
Plus, there's this super messed up event\nhappening soon.
Could you elaborate?
It's called "Save Your Fave." Basically, any\nidols that don't hit their sales quota will\nbe fired.
Don't tell anyone, but it's meant to weed out\nthe girls likely to quit soon...
...and Narumi-chan is one of them.
Narumi-chan's working another job, right?\nThat's why she was late today.
And the producer has yelled at her before to\nquit the other job to focus on this one.
But there's no way she can do that because\nno matter how many hours she puts in here,\nshe still won't make much.
Narumi's family has it rough. And she has to\nwork to support her little sister.
I think Narumi-chan wants to continue working\nas an idol...
But she said she'll probably have to quit\nthis job so she can make enough money for\nher family.
And the producer, fully aware of this,\nintends to force Naruru out at this event?
Either she succeeds and he profits, or he\nloses someone who planned to quit anyway.
On top of that, the event's gonna bleed the\nfans dry. Messed up, right?
The two of us are safe for now, but I\nwouldn't be surprised if we're next.
Screw that! If I'm gonna be put on display\nlike some prize cow, then I'm quittin' too!
Please be aware that I am overcome with\nblind rage.
How dare that vile man exploit a precious\nidol like Naruru and try to steal her dreams\naway!
Yes. Those are the words I was waiting for.
If I may offer a suggestion...
Considering the magnitude of his heinous\ndeeds, it is likely that this producer has a\nShadow in Mementos.
Therefore, just as you have done up\nuntil now...
I believe you can make that corrupt producer\nhave a change of heart.
{PLAYER_NAME}-sama... I implore you.\nPlease accept my request.
I appreciate your kindness in this matter.
I wish you and the Phantom Thieves the best\nof luck.
Money, money, money, moneeey! Money, gimme\nthat sweet, sweet moneeeeeey!
I'm tellin' ya, idols are cash cows. Fans\nwill sign their lives away for a single photo!
Heheheh, fan or idol, I'll milk 'em all dry!
C'moooooon then, try me! Bring it, babyyyyy!
What's your problem? What'd I do wrong?
I just tried to let idols and fans live their\ndreams!
I wasn't always like this. I used to have\nhonest ambitions as a producer.
But I was incompetent. I couldn't fulfill\nanyone's dreams!
I was so broken by my own failure... Before\nI knew it, I was resorting to shady business\ntactics.
Why did it turn out this way?
Really? You really think so?
Huh... I hope you're right.
At least those girls... those budding idols\nstill have a bright future ahead.
{PLAYER_NAME}-sama. You have fulfilled my\nrequest flawlessly.
I have been occupied with my work as your\nconcierge and have not visited the con caf\xe9\nas of late.
I am concerned for Naruru.
I do apologize for the short notice, but I\nask that you accompany me.
Merope-chan! Welcome, you two!
I was hoping you'd come. I have some news!
Oh, let me show you to your seats. Right\nthis way!
I'm sorry about the other day. I must have\nworried you.
And... You heard from my coworkers, right?\nThat I might lose my job.
Well, that's all over now! I can keep working\nas an idol!
It's like the producer became a different\nperson overnight. He even pays us\nproperly now.
So I can quit my other job and focus on\nthis one!
How wonderful. An idol's smile is a fan's\ngreatest treasure.
I am aglow with supreme bliss at this moment.
Oh, I guess I must have worried you too.\nSorry about that, but thank you!
Oh, thank you! I thought you only came by for\nMerope-chan's sake...
But you were cheering for me too! I just\ncouldn't be happier!
Also, they canceled that awful event.
And we're holding a fan appreciation event\ninstead.
We're only supposed to invite the regulars,\nbut here you go!
I'd love it if you both came!
Naruru! Could you serve that table their\npancakes?
Yes! Right away!
Sorry. Duty calls.
Please come to our event. I'll see you there!
Were they happy?
Yes! Thank you so much for the tickets.
Not at all. Anything for the sake of our\nidols and their fans.
The shop is quite busy today. We will\ninconvenience the other fans if we stay for\ntoo long.
Naruru's smile was all I could ask for. Let\nus be off.
Naruru personally handed me an exclusive\nevent ticket... I never knew such euphoria\nas this.
Thank you for granting my request. You have\nmy deepest gratitude.
I believe Naruru appreciated your support\nas well. I will consider today a victory for\nus both.
Now, we must thoroughly prepare if we wish to\nmake the most of this event.
I do hope that I have your cooperation.
I knew you would say as much.
Ah, this must be what they call "tsundere."
Your love for Naruru is pure and true. As a\nfellow fan, I shall not be outdone.
Our contract has deepened my understanding of\nyou tenfold.
This event will require glow sticks, happi\ncoats, handmade fans, and...
This too is part of our special contract.
Now let us part. I appreciate your\ncooperation.
Oh? {NAME1}-sama. You have brought the\nPersona I requested.
I recognize that you are eager to fulfill our\ncontract.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I ask\nthat you follow me.
Today is the fan appreciation event.
Naruru will not be the only performer\nfeatured.
Please understand that you must show respect\nto the entire cast.
Your support of Naruru is already flawless.
Therefore, I shall now demonstrate how to\ncheer on the other performers.
Yes. That is the spirit.
I shall first teach you the basic chants\nwhich can be used for any idol.
Menma! Hammer! Ginger!
Amber! Summer! Samba! Salad bar!
Next, we shall practice how to properly wave\nglow sticks.
Finally, we must dress the part.
We are prepared. Be advised that I am\novercome with emotion.
It feels like only yesterday that we began\nour special contract.
I admit I did not expect this change within\nmyself either.
She has acted as a vital turning point in\nboth of our lives.
Even after that corrupt producer tried to\nexploit her, Naruru never lost her light.
This opportunity to meet and help her has\nbrought me indescribable joy.
I never imagined that I would develop such an\nintense desire to support Naruru.
Now I feel I have come to understand you\nand the concept of human desire much more\nthoroughly.
And as your concierge, I am confident that I\ncan provide you even greater support going\nforward.
I believe this experience has been beneficial\nfor you, too.
It was not just I who learned from engaging\nin idol culture.
Idols do not display their emotions freely.\nThey hide their true feelings behind a\nsmile... a mask.
Now you have honed the same ability.
You may utilize each of your Personas to\nmatch your ever-changing environment and\ncircumstance.
And of course, I shall continue to support\nyou as a fan.
Indeed. I have high hopes for both you\nand Naruru.
I have realized in this moment that I am as\nmuch a fan of yours as I am a fan of hers.
Now, I will support you and Naruru with all\nof my heart and soul.
Nevertheless...
I would like for us to expend all efforts in\nsupporting Naruru at today's event.
Let us promise to make this event shine. For\nNaruru's sake, and your own.
Excellent timing. I wish for us to go\nsomewhere together to better understand\nyour true self.
I must assert that this arrangement is not\npart of our contract, so you are not obliged\nto come. What do you say?
Then, let us be off.
Another time, then.
I hear the stars evoke feelings of awe within\npeople.
What about you? Do you feel it?
If even you harbor uncertainty, then such\nknowledge must be beyond my comprehension.
And how does it feel to be in awe? I have\nmuch to learn about human emotions.
Oh? What manner of desire is it exactly?\nIs it excitement toward the stars?
It appears I am mistaken. The intricacies of\nhuman emotion still remain quite the enigma\nto me.
I have noticed a high percentage of our\nfellow guests are holding hands.
What do you think? Shall we follow their\nexample?
Idle anticipation is more formidable a foe\nthan fear. Now then...
Your hand...
It is a bit dry. I will recommend you a\nskincare routine.
Is that a rule of etiquette? I find the\ncomplexities of social graces are often\nveiled in interpretive ambiguity...
Precisely how much time is required before\nwe may hold hands? One day? Two?
Behold, a movie theater: a recreational\nfacility that serves as a hub of human\ndesire.
I hear movies in particular are a form of\nentertainment that requires much time and\neffort.
For what reason do people make and\nwatch them?
Yes, they are a form of expression. An\nintegration of various art forms born of\nhuman desire...
Gazing at a dazzling screen in a dim room is\nmuch like a ritual.
I see. In short, it is to escape reality?
To go to such lengths... Escapism is a\npowerful human desire.
Man found gods within the earth, the\nmountains, and the sky...
And spun tales of these entities, passing\nthem down through generations...
Movies share in that very same tradition.
They are the mythos of the modern day.
Humans have not correlated the two? Perhaps\nit is an unconscious behavior.
As always, your quick acumen is a boon.
At any rate, I must assess these "movies"\nwith my own eyes.
Incidentally, I have learned that "popcorn"\nis an essential part of the experience.
This is Kokatsu Academy. I believe you attend\nthis institution.
A bittersweet melting pot of desires,\nregrets, triumphs, and failures rest within\nits walls...
What desires do you embrace as you engage in\nyour academic journey?
Youth... You speak of the golden era bestowed\nexclusively upon the adolescent?
A desire that is truly sublime. I urge you to\nproceed with your endeavors.
That appears to be the general consensus\namong today's generation. However, you are no\nordinary teenager.
As your concierge, I would like you to be\nmore avaricious.
Studies, sports, friends, romance... There is\nmuch desire to be found.
I acknowledge your dedication to your...\nextra-curricular commitments, but take care\nnot to neglect your school life.
If anything, the true source of your power\nlies in your own desires.
You will understand one day. For now, keep\nmy words at heart.
I would expect no less from you. I am honored\nto be your concierge.
Now, I desire a tour of the school. I wish to\nimmerse myself in this "feeling of youth" for\nmyself.
Jinbocho is known as the world's largest\nmarketplace for secondhand books.
I have perused through various books in my\nattempt to study human nature.
What about you? Have you an affinity for\nreading?
That is sufficient. Manga is a very popular\nform of amusement in the modern day.
It is a clear reflection of your desires.\nI am much intrigued.
How wonderful. Reading is the embodiment of\nintellectual desire.
I am quite curious as to what you have read.
Incidentally, my most recent literary\npursuits have been centered around idols.
Idol magazines in particular have contributed\ngreatly to the concept of Phantom Idols.
Indeed. Next to the Velvet Room, this\nmarketplace is like a second home to me.
Indeed. I have already forged strong\nconnections with several shop owners.
Leave everything to me. I shall take it upon\nmyself to escort you through the mesmerizing\nlandscape of literature.
A Ferris wheel moves slowly to allow one to\nenjoy the view at different heights...
...Or so everyone believes.
In truth, it is a throne where desires and\nlove clash, and relationships are formed.
Or so claims a certain book. Yet, now that we\nare inside, it appears to be devoid of such\ncharacteristics.
What do you think? Does your heart brim with\ndesire?
That is wonderful. Please lay bare those\ndesires.
Do you mean to say I do not stimulate your\ndesires?
Who will, then? Let us bring them along\nnext time.
Hmm. The desire between lovers is truly\ninexplicable.
As a concept well beyond my grasp, it is\nobvious I still have much to learn.
In the meantime, please continue to\naccompany me.
Is this...!? What an exceptional masterpiece\u2014\nit checks all of my boxes.
Words cannot do justice to how thankful I am.\nI will cherish this wonderful day forever.
I am correct in that you wish to give this\nto me...?
I appreciate your kindness. I graciously\naccept this gift.
Where would you like to go first?
I would like you to choose where we will be\ngoing.
An excellent choice, I must say.
Going here would not serve you well at this\ntime, I must say.
I feel that contemplating the vastness of\nthe starry sky like this has been a very\nmeaningful use of time.
I find the plot of this movie vexing. Perhaps\nbecause mortal desires are mysterious and\nunfathomable to me...
The school... Though it is far removed from\nme, I hear it is an unforgettable and\nemotional place for everyone.
Now then, what kind of books shall we\nencounter today? I must say, I am quite\nexcited.
Facing you like this, letting everything else\nfade away... It is quite envigorating.
I have been waiting for you. I would like to\npart from our usual routine for today, if you\nwill...
I would like to accompany you to your abode,\nso that I may understand you more deeply.
Would this be inconvenient for you?
If it is as you say, then so be it. Perhaps\nanother time then.
So these are your personal quarters... I see,\nhow intriguing.
How do you usually occupy your time while you\nare here?
An important activity. I have heard that\nsleep is vital for humans to reach their full\npotential.
Please, do not hesitate to sleep if you so\ndesire. After all, I am the one imposingly\nobserving your room.
Are you embarrased? I suppose this is your\npersonal space.
I understand there must be... some matters\nhere you wish to keep to yourself. Allow me\nto test my own intuiton.
Hmm... This space seems to have a very\ndifferent feel from the Velvet Room.
The Velvet Room is a place between dreams and\nreality, mind and matter...
It also reflects the "mental state" of those\nwho visit it.
Though this is now the material plane, these\nare your private quarters. I presumed the two\nwould share a common thread.
I see. Reflecting one's mental state and\nattaining mental calm are not one and\nthe same.
I see. I understand that were my master here,\nit would certainly be difficult to relax.
However, pay me no mind. I would like you to\nthink of me as invisible if you so need.
Your private quarters are quite... curious.\nI feel as though I could discover something\nnew with each visit.
I must say, I'm incredibly grateful for how\nyou accompanied me to the con caf\xe9 earlier.
Because you were there, I was able to enjoy\nmyself without hesitation. I am glad it is\nsomething we were able to do together.
However, I realize that I may have been the\nonly one having fun.
For that reason, I hope you'll allow me to\nentertain you today.
Indeed. If I may be so bold, I would like to\nact as your personal employee.
No need for shyness. If I may be so bold,\nallow me to act as your personal employee.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
So... what can I get for you?
My emulation here is so that you may\nexperience what I felt.
However, it seems I must study further on\nhow to express emotion. At any rate, I hope\nyou will bear with me for this time.
Today's special is the "Gimme Your Love\u266a Fave\nOmelette Rice."
Great, one order of Fave Omelette Rice.
Thanks for waiting. Here is your Fave\nOmelette Rice...
Got it. So... Who is your favorite?
That's right. It's me, Merope, also known as\nyour concierge.
You mustn't feel embarrassed. Once you cast\naway the momentary shame, you will feel only\nbliss.
At any rate, it can be quite difficult in the\nmoment. Let us conclude there for today.
What do you think? I hope you enjoyed that.
I hope we'll be able to continue socializing\nin this way going forward.
I believe it will lead to mental growth,\nwhich will in turn strengthen your Personas.
I must say, I'm incredibly grateful for how\nyou accompanied me to the photoshoot earlier.
For that reason, I hope you'll allow me to\ninvite you to a photoshoot today.
Indeed. If I may be so bold, I would like to\nact as your personal fave.
No need for shyness. If I may be so bold,\nI would like to act as your personal fave.
Ah, {NAME1}-chan. Thank you so much for\ncoming.
I am recreating the event we had with my fave\nso that you may experience what I felt.
Now then, let us take a fan photo together.
Are you ready? Okay. And pose.
Come now, {NAME1}-chan. It's lonely being\nthe only one to pose for a photograph.
Okay, here we go. Great pose, by the way,\n{NAME1}-chan.
Yay. Look at us, {NAME1}-chan and Merope.\nTwo peas in a pod.
What do you think? I hope I was able to\nconvey the fun of a photoshoot to you\nas well.
I had intended for you to enjoy this, but I\nmust admit that it was enjoyable for me\nas well.
I would not be opposed to actually taking a\nselfie with you someday.
Hey, {NAME2}! You have a sec?
There's something I wanna ask you.
But not here... Let's go somewhere else! We\ncan grab a bite and chat at the diner!
You'll accompany Motoha? Then I shall leave\nyou to it.
No worries! Maybe some other time.
So, that thing I wanted to ask... It's about\nthe Phantom Thieves.
You need to be strong to fight in the\nMetaverse, right?
I've kept up some light strength training\nsince quitting baseball, but it's not enough.
So please, will you train with me!?
The truth is, I have ZERO motivation when I'm\nalone...
I've always trained with Tomoko since\nlittle league. I really can't improve without a\nbuddy.
And if I'm with you, I don't have to explain\nwhy I wanna get strong!
Plus, it's not a bad deal for you, {NAME2},\nright?
Please, be my coach!
Thanks! I'm counting on you, {NAME2}.
Hmmm... I wonder what sort of training a\nPhantom Thief should do?
No doubt running and push-ups and stuff,\nright? Upper body-strength seems essential,\ntoo...
Let's see... Running, strength training. Also\npitching and batting practice, of course!
There are batting cages in Yongen-Jaya I used\nto go to all the time with Tomoko.
We wanted to hit a home run really bad, so we\npracticed our hearts out there.
Ahaha, I guess so. I really threw myself into\nevery swing.
I haven't gone since I quit baseball, but\nit'll always be a special place to me.
I did. Once, maybe? I don't really remember.
Talking about this kinda makes me wanna go\nback there. Should we go after this?
Great!
Wow, it's been forever since I've come here.\nStill exactly the same.
Um... I'm good today.
I'm still in my school uniform and all!\nI can't swing in this outfit.
Besides, I don't need to improve my batting\nskills like I did before.
But we did come all the way out here. If you\nwanna hit, go for it, {NAME2}!
Oh yeah! I can also give you all my tips and\ntricks for swinging the bat.
So how about it? I'll give you pointers from\nbehind! This place also has prizes, so it\nshould be fun!
All right! Done deal!
In return, you're gonna help me work out.
All right, let's head over to the cage.
Step out forward a bit further!
Yeah, just like that, perfect!
What's up? Wanna train together?
Would you like to spend time with Motoha?
Okay! Let's meet up after getting changed!
No worries! We can work out together when\nyou're free!
So I've been thinking... I feel like we\nshould start from the basics.
That means wind sprints!
Just kidding! Let's start with walking. We've\ngotta ease our bodies into exercising.
All right, let's get started!
Phew, I'm exhausted!
So, since getting out of school, we've been\nat this for... two and a half hours? Really?\nIt's way earlier than I expected...
...but my knees are already shaking.
Walking seems so easy. I had no idea I was\nthis outta shape...
I'm glad we didn't start with sprints.
I'll just have to keep this up, till I regain\nmy strength, and get strong like I used to\u2014
Huh? Oh, sorry. I was just... remembering\nstuff.
Back in the day I used to practice batting at\nfull strength after running.
But now... there's no way I could do that.\nAnd not because I'm physically weaker.
I know what I said to Kiuchi. But the truth\nis... I still feel something holding me back.
That's why I avoided playing at the batting\ncages.
I know there isn't any real reason why I\nshouldn't play baseball anymore.
I've found the strength to go back to it...\nto go after what I love again. But... I think\nI'm scared to.
I keep thinking... what if something bad\nhappens again?
Thanks... I feel a bit better hearing you\nsay that.
Coming from you, {NAME2}, it really does\nfeel like things will be okay.
Yeah... You're right.
But I can't keep running away.
That's it. I'm gonna go to the batting cages\nright now!
Plus, you're with me.
I feel like if I go now, I can do it.
Even though I'm exhausted, I'm gonna face\nthis head on!
Okay, here I go!
The pitch wasn't even that fast...
Ugh... Next! Next!
I'm useless. I can't hit anything!
Easy pitches, ground balls, nothing! My arm's\nreally sore too.
Sorry to drag you all the way out here to\nwatch me not hit a single frickin' ball.
I gave you all those pointers only to whiff\nmyself. I'm so pathetic. Ahaha...
Obviously it sucks now, but I'll be damned if\nI don't try again. Anyway, thanks for today!
Thanks to you, {NAME2}, I feel like I can\nstart moving forward again.
Later!
'Sup!? Feel like training with me?
Cool cool! Let's get changed and get to work!
No biggie! Hit me up when you're free!
Huh. So this is what it looks like inside.
I thought we could work out at the gym today.
I found a coupon for this place while I was\nlooking into strength training!
I've never focused on bulking up before.\nFirst, I wanna try out all the equipment!
So, um... You hold this part and\u2014 Whoa,\nit moved!
This is... harder... than I thought!\n{NAME2}... How you doing?
Ah! Hooo! Raaagh!
Now let's try the dumbells!
Whoa, lots of different options. What size\nwill you rep with, {NAME2}?
You gotta try harder than that! Why do they\neven have weights that light!?
Nice, sounds perfect! It says here that's a\ngreat weight for beginners.
200 pounds? Go for it, champ.
I'll try... those! It's my first time,\nso I'll go with the 5 pounders.
*pant* *huff* Ngh...!
Is this how slow reps... are supposed to\nfeel? 'Cause I think they're working...
My arms... feel so... heavy! You?
Dang, you're strong! I can't go fallin'\nbehind!
I know, right? We shouldn't overdo it. Let's\ntake a break.
Phew! Ahaha, I'm wiped.
But no pain no gain, right!? Fatigue now,\nmuscles later.
I'll be ripped before you know it...
Ahahaha, lookin' good, Mr. Muscles!
Oh by the way, I actually went back to the\nbatting cages again on my own.
You really encouraged me, {NAME2}.
So I felt like I had to give it another shot.
I still sucked, but I played in a much better\nmood than before.
So thanks for that, {NAME2}!
You've been a big help with this Kiuchi thing\ntoo. I really owe you a lot, {NAME2}.
Let me know if I can ever return the favor!
And I'm counting on you too, Leader!
Yup, leave it to me!
Thought you'd never ask!
See you later!
JK, like that's possible!
What's the haps? Wanna work out?
That's cool! Holler at me when you've\ngot time!
All right, let's go! Get ready for some\nwalkin'!
Nah, we're goin' somewhere else today.
Nope! Thought we'd go somewhere a bit\ndifferent for today's training.
Mmm, pork buns and fried rice...
Wait, there's no way we can walk there!
Anyway, just follow me. We don't have to\nchange today.
I think the training's working. We've walked\nfor forty minutes and I'm not out of breath!
I'm making today my cheat day.
Ever since I decided to get into shape, I've\nbeen watching my diet.
I still gotta treat myself from time to time,\nbut I might lose control if I'm alone.
Yes! Just like that! Oh, and you can order\nwhatever you want, {NAME2}.
You're here doing me a solid, so this one's\non me!
Time to dig in!
Mmm! So good!
Yup, I'd definitely die without parfaits!\nAhhh, chocolate that melts in your mouth\nis the best!
Ahhh, I'm so full and happy...
Rewarding myself from time to time helps me\nstay motivated for training.
My little league coach taught me that.
He said it's bad to work too hard, and that\ndepriving yourself is actually worse for\nyour body.
By eating what I like today... I can give it\nmy all tomorrow!
Yup! I'm a car, and parfaits are my gas!
I... No way! I'm gonna walk after this and\nburn it all off.
Hehe, thanks! I couldn't do it without you,\nCoach.
You know, there was this one girl in little\nleague who really watched what she ate.
Even though we were kids, her lunch was only\nred meat. Plus she counted her calories.
I never put in that kinda effort. I also ate\na ton of fried chicken. Ahaha...
What was her name again? I think she's the\nsame age as us...
Thanks for today, Coach! All right, time to\nwalk all the way home!
Also, I'm waaay too full, so the batting\ncages are a no-go today.
Is that... Motoha Arai?
She did mention the batting cages... Probably\nthe ones in Yongen-Jaya...
Walking after a big meal is great! I can feel\nthe calories burning!
Yo! Ready for a workout?
Sounds good! Let's hit the locker rooms, then\nmeet back up!
Ah, okay! Another time then!
I'm used to walking now. Soon I should be\ngood to try running.
With all of our strength training, my muscles\nare lookin' pretty in shape now...
So today I wanna see how hard these arms can\nswing.
Thanks, I will! Cheer me on, okay, {NAME2}?
'Course not! If you're gonna underestimate me,\njust remember who's holdin' the bat, bud.
Ahaha... I wonder if I can. Welp, I'll give\nit shot!
Hiyah!
Right... there!
Ahhh...!
One more time! Huh?
I guess that was the last ball. Hmmm...\nI wonder what my batting stats are.
More importantly, I'm swinging better than\nbefore. And my arm isn't getting sore anymore\neither.
The first time we came, my arms hurt so bad\nthey were shaking...
But now the training is finally starting to\npay off.
All right, I'm feelin' pretty good about\nthis. Time to give it another go!
Ah, that girl...
Whoa! She's on the home run board... and\nbatting at expert level!
She's so awesome! I wanna train so I can bat\nlike her.
Uh... Hey! That was really awesome! You hit\nso many home runs!
Obviously. I've worked hard to get this far.
To keep up with you... Motoha Arai.
Whoa, how do you know my name?
You were my one and only rival... I could\nnever forget your name.
But it seems my mediocrity never left an\nimpression on you...
Um, that's... Sorry...
Tamayo... Yoshida... Tamayo... Tamayo... Ah!
Yeah, she's the kid I was talking about. The\none with the strict diet!
You are, right?
Yeah. Hmph, nice of you to remember.
Right... So you're still playing baseball.
Yup. Even after you quit.
I was surprised to see my rival disappear\nfrom the mound so suddenly.
But!
You getting back into baseball is better than\nanything I could've wished for!
Motoha Arai, I need your help.
My help...?
I practice every day in the hopes of one day\nreviving women's pro baseball.
There's only so much I can do on my own. But\nwith you back in the game, I'm sure we could\ndo it!
I'm happy that you thought of me.
I can't help you the way I am now.
Didn't you watch me swing earlier? Unlike\nyou, I could barely get a run\u2014let alone a\nhome run.
You've been away from the sport, but there's\nno way you've lost your unmatched sense\nfor it.
If you work at it, I'm sure you'll be a\nfirst-string player in no time!
Pitching, batting, an all-rounder... That's\nwho you were in little league!
Sure I was "Mean Mitts Motoha" back in the\nday, but that's ancient history.
Plus...
Hey, asshat!
You were with her at the diner too. Who the\nhell are you?
Yeah. I'll slack off if I train alone,\nso he's here to supervise me.
Yeah, a good friend who watches my back in\nbattl\u2014 Batting practice, and stuff...
This is no time for jokes!
He's a friend! Just a friend, okay!?
So, what I'm trying to say is... He's my\ncoach!
Coach, huh...?
Doesn't look like much of a coach.
Wha\u2014!? Sure he is!
No! We're not gonna take that!
Take that back!
I just stated a fact.
If you train with that coach, you won't get\nback to your former glory.
Join my team. You'll be trained by first-rate\ncoaches.
I said I can't help you right now! Besides,\nif you're gonna talk to my friend like\nthat...
That how you wanna play it?
Fine. Then how 'bout this? Let's decide by\nwho can hit the most home runs.
If you win, I'll take back what I said. But\nif you lose, you're gonna help me bring back\nthe women's pro league.
Fine! Let's do it!
It's settled then. We'll each hit three balls\nfrom that machine. Whoever gets more\nhomers wins.
But it'd be too easy for me to crush you now.\nLet me know when you think you're ready to\ntake me on!
I'll be waiting for the day you join my team,\nMotoha Arai!
Wahahahaha!
I'll knock you out of the park first!
Oh god! Why did I say that!?
I just got so worked up! What do I do!? Can I\nreally beat her!?
Yeah! If you say so, {NAME2}, I actually\nfeel like I can!
Right! First I need to get to the point where\nI can hit a home run!
Yeah! There's no way I can lose! Wait,\nall-rounder? Am I pitching and batting!?
Anyway! I'm not ready to win yet, so I've\ngotta train!
We'll show her what a good coach you are.\nSo to do that...
Please keep helping me train!
With you at my side, I'm unstoppable!
Thanks for helpin' me out, Coach!
What's goin' on? Wanna head to the batting\ncages with me?
Thanks...
Got it! Gimme a shout next time you're free!
So, um... Sorry about last time. I was being\nselfish.
I've only been thinking of winning lately...
This training was supposed to make me\nstronger as a Phantom Thief, not for me to\ntake on Tamayo.
But when she badmouthed you... I just got so\npissed.
So I'm, you know, sorry I got you involved\nand stuff.
Awesome! Thank you, {NAME2}.
All right, let's get in some special training\nat the batting cages. I won't lose to Tamayo!
Take that!
I'll make you eat those words! No way I'm\nlosing to you!
Raaagh!
All right!
Just one more... pitch!
I'm making contact with the ball more than\nbefore. Home runs will happen at some point.
When I was in little league, nonstop\nswinging practice like this was how I\nimproved.
If I keep this up, I'll be knocking 'em out\nin no time!
Sure, I stopped playing for a bit, but I was\nable to hit Kiuchi's pitch at his Palace.
A pitching machine is nothing by comparison!\nDon't you think, {NAME2}?
I know, right? Okay, back to batting\npractice!
Oof... So, you're not sure I can win? Don't\nworry! Watch me bring the fury!
Next one will be a home run! Just you watch!\nMaybe not though, haha.
All right, one more time!
Don't be afraid to give me pointers, Coach!
My hands are used to swinging again! Now\nwe're talkin'!
Haaaaa!
I need to send the ball higher. Maybe if I\nangle the bat like this...
Nope!
Phew!
*pant* *pant*...
I'm starving. Let's stop here for today.
Thanks for hangin' with me, {NAME2}!
Ahaha... Now my stomach's grumbling. What\nshould I eat on the way home?
I'll hit that home run next time! You'll see!
Hey, how's it goin'? Feel like hitting the\nbatting cages?
Cool! Let's change and head over!
Oh, okay. Lemme know when you're around!
Haaah!
Motoha Arai...
Oh, it's you... The "coach." {PLAYER_NAME}...\nright?
I...
No, this isn't a conversation for here.\nIf you wanna talk, follow me.
I think I said this before, but Motoha was\nmy idol.
I have two older brothers. Both into baseball\nfrom a young age.
I've always liked my brothers and respected\nthem. I even cheered them on at nationals.
So, when I started thinking I wanted to play\nbaseball too, my brother told me of the\nlegend that was Motoha Arai.
He said he'd played against a girl my age and\nlost miserably. That girl was Motoha Arai.
I was shocked. After that I joined\nmy brother's team and waited for a match\nagainst her.
The first time we faced off was the day I\nlearned what a true prodigy looks like!
I wanted to be like that. If I were as strong\nas her, I could keep playing baseball in the\nfuture like my brothers.
I know it's harder for women to go pro, so I\nstrived to get stronger.
I was devastated when Motoha Arai disappeared\nfrom baseball.
It wasn't always about the competition.\nI wanted to be on the same pro team with her\nsome day.
Obviously, my love for baseball didn't fizzle\nwhen she jumped ship.
Instead, I put enough effort into it for the\nboth of us!
After little league, I joined the school team\nand decided I wanted to become a pro women's\nbaseball player no matter what!
I even talk tougher now. I needed to have\nthick skin to be taken seriously in the\nmale-dominated sports world.
But I also realized... I can't bring back the\nwomen's pro league on my own.
Knowing that, I still train day in and day\nout. But now...!
If Motoha Arai comes back to baseball, then\nthere's still hope!
One strong player can change the world!
Besides, she's here because she loves\nbaseball, right?
Then this should all make sense to her. That\ngirl will always have a place on the field!
Fine. I know I didn't ask her feelings\noutright, but there's no way her love for\nbaseball has changed!
No one loved baseball more than she did\nback then.
Let me ask you one thing. Why did you become\nMotoha Arai's coach?
Huh. I'm curious how much of a help you\nactually end up being.
You sound like you couldn't care less. No way\nI'm leaving Motoha Arai's coaching to a jerk\nlike you.
Friends? Huh. So you're not teammates. Hmm...
I know what you're gonna say, so spare me.\nI'm not backing down.
Our match is just around the corner!
If you wanna prove you're right, then all\nshe has to do is hit some home runs.
I'll be waiting to hear from her when she's\nready! Until then, "Coach."
Ahahahaha!
Another day of whiffs. Ow... My arm hurts...
Oh, {NAME2}? Where were you?
Yay, juice! Thanks, I'm gonna drink this,\nthen practice some more.
Whew! I feel refreshed! All right, let's go\none more time!
Thanks for today! Look forward to my home\nruns, buddy!
I'm going to the batting cages today.
Could you look at my form for me?
Today I'm definitely gonna hit a home run!
Okey-doke! I'll head over there first!
Don't sweat it! Just let me know when you\nhave time!
*huff* *huff*...!
Why...?
Why can't I hit anything!?
Oh, {NAME2}...
I'm sorry. I know I invited you here, but I'm\nsuch a wreck...
But\u2014
I have to work this hard! I just have to!
Tamayo has always worked super hard, right?
I need to work twice, no, a hundred times as\nhard to catch up to her!
Um...?
But! I need to train...
Fine, I said that. But Tamayo is definitely\nusing this time to get ahead of me!
I wanted to fight as a Phantom Thief. So I\nstarted getting in shape...
If I change people's hearts, then I can help\neveryone who's lost their desires like I did.
That's what I want.
How could I!?
Even when I was away from it, I always loved\nit. The truth is I've been dying to practice\nagain!
I wanna continue baseball if I can. My reason\nfor quitting doesn't exist anymore.
I don't care what form it takes... I just\nwant baseball in my life again.
Of course they are!
Baseball is important to me, and so are the\nPhantom Thieves. That's how I really feel.
But I can't enjoy baseball at a time\nlike this.
There's people suffering, getting their hope\nstolen from them, and I'm supposed to ignore\nthat so I can toss a ball on a field?
That's impossible!
Am I supposed to say, "Not my problem\nanymore, so whatever!"? That's bullshit.
I want to protect everyone's dreams as a\nPhantom Thief!
If I'm going to have a happy future playing\nthe sport I love, then everyone else needs a\nhappy future too!
Oh. I can't believe I didn't realize that\ntill now.
Haha... Nice work, Coach. I never would've\nrealized without your help, {NAME2}.
I guess I should...
Oh. I... finally get it, I think.
I know what I have to do. I was so laser\nfocused on beating Tamayo that I couldn't\nthink straight.
But everything's gonna be okay now! I know\nwhat to do.
Excuse me, can I get a chocolate parfait,\na steak, melon soda, omelette rice...
Also, add to that some...
Mmm! This parfait is earth-shattering!
{NAME2}, I'm so glad I asked you to be my\ncoach.
If it were just me, I would've been\noverworking myself non-stop.
Sure it's important to work hard, but I\nforgot how much I need to take breaks\nfrom it.
Hey, {NAME2}?
Honestly... I think we both know there's no\nway I can beat Tamayo.
But you've been supporting me like this\ndespite that...
I guess what I'm asking is, why are you doing\nthis all for me?
Ahaha... I don't know why I blush when you\nsay we're a team...
I guess it's kinda like how Tomoko and I were\nteammates. Hmm, okay...
Uh, thanks, {NAME2}! I'll do my best for\nthe team!
Now that stress is gone, I'm feelin' pretty\nhungry! I think it's time we invite some\ncaramel parfait to this party!
Mmm, so full! My tank's on F for sure!
Um um um um um what!? Wh-What do you mean\nby that!?
A-Are you teasing me? You're not... right!?
Ah\u2014 I'm\u2014 Uh...
Happy...
I-I'm startin' to get hungry again! Time for\nanother parfait!
Thanks a lot for today. Really.
Hey, so... I'm thinking of doing that\nchallenge with Tamayo.
Do you mind coming with me today?
Are you going to spend time with Motoha?
Thanks. All right, let's go!
Oh... Well I need my coach there, so lemme\nknow when you're around.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Motoha Arai.
No, you waited all this time for me. I should\nbe the one apologizing.
Let's confirm the rules. We each get three\npitches, and whoever hits more home runs\nwins.
If I win, you join my baseball team.
But if you win, I'll give up on you and\napologize sincerely to your coach. Sound\ngood?
Yeah, fine by me.
Good. I'll bat first!
Must be pretty confident if you called me\nout here. Too bad I'm about to knock that\nconfidence right outta the park.
It's not over yet... Next! Haaah!
Tamayo... She's amazing!
This last pitch's mine!
If you wanna beat me, you'll have to hit\nthree home runs.
So here's your chance to surrender. What do\nyou say?
No way. I've already decided. I'm doing this.
Here I go, Coach!
Leave it to me!
Next! Hng!
Last one! Haaah!
What the hell was that!? Didn't you show up\nbecause you thought you could win!?
This is the extent of what I can do.
I'm glad that I inspired you. But I'm not the\nsame person I was back then.
I can't get to your level with a little\npractice after quitting the game for so long.
That just proves how hard you've worked.
I love baseball, and I still wanna play. But\nI'm not ready just yet.
If I'm gonna play alongside you, I need to\npractice a hell of a lot more.
I hope to compete at your level one day. But\nfor now, I can't join your team yet.
Sorry if that sounds selfish.
I'll keep my promise to you since I lost...\nBut it'd be best for the both of us if\nI wait.
Motoha Arai... I've always looked up to you\nas a baseball player.
I've always practiced hard in the hopes of\nplaying like you one day...
But now... I'm a better player than you.
I knew full well that no matter how hard I\ntried, I wouldn't be able to beat you... But\nI still came to face you.
Did your coach over there tell you to do\nthis?
I see.
You still came to compete knowing you'd\nlose...
That strength must be what inspired me back\nthen. I remember now...
Motoha Arai.
I'm sorry for being selfish. Thanks for\nhumoring me.
Not at all... I'm the one who lost my temper\nand jumped on board with the competition.
Your sense for baseball hasn't faded. I'll be\nwaiting for your comeback.
Thanks. I'm gonna work hard so I can play\nalongside you, so look forward to it!
I'll challenge you again once you've polished\nyour skills!
Wahaha! You're my one and only rival after\nall, Motoha Arai!
I lost... But I knew that already.
Couldn't have done it without you behind\nme, {NAME2}.
Really? Ehehe... Gotta say, I like being\ncalled cool!
I got so happy when people would say that\nto me in little league! I didn't think I'd get\nto hear it again.
Absolutely not!
I went through with the competition so I\nwouldn't have any regrets.
I know I won't be at Tamayo's level anytime\nsoon... But I'm gonna work my butt off to get\nthere!
I've got you here cheering me on after all.
But I'm gonna focus on the Phantom Thieves\nfirst! I wanna be able to throw myself back\ninto baseball at full strength.
Ahaha, you got it.
I won't reach peak coolness till I can steal\na base and the bad guys' hearts, right!?
Aghhh! After all that hubbub, I'm starving.
Hey, let's hit the diner before going home!\nBut it's not my cheat day, so I'll skip the\nparfait!
It's all thanks to your support, {NAME2}.
Thanks to you, I made peace with losing.
I'm gonna keep doing my best from now on.\nAnd you'll be there for me through it all,\nright?
I escorted Motoha home.
Are you free today? I want you to come with\nme somewhere...
I want you to come with me somewhere.
I'll meet you in front of the school gates!
Next time!
I used to come here after losing a match when\nI was in little league.
Tomoko and I would shout into the ocean,\n"We lost!"
Then we'd head to the shopping mall over\nthere to grab ice cream before going home.
But I realized that I didn't do that when I\nlost to Tamayo the other day.
I feel like maybe it wasn't as frustrating\nlosing this time compared to back then. It's\nalmost like I'm over it.
And the reason I can say that now is because\nof my coach. You, {NAME2}.
Thank you for standing by me through all of\nthe training and the contest with Tamayo.
Well, I seriously can't thank you enough.\nAhaha...
I've always felt like losing was the end of\nthe world. Like if you lose a tournament,\nthat's it, you're done, you know?
But this was different. Losing wasn't\nthe end.
I understand now. I actually gained something\nfrom this defeat.
But there are some fights I can't let myself\nlose.
Like... If I lost to Kiuchi, I never could've\nfaced Tamayo.
And in Tamayo's mind, I was the hurdle she\ncould never jump over...
Plus if I had lost to Kiuchi, even more\npeople's desires would've been stolen\nfrom them.
Moving forward, there will be more fights I\ncan't afford to lose.
Once I win those, I'll face Tamayo again, and\nplay catch with Tomoko too...
I'm gonna need to work even harder! I swear\nI'll keep working hard from here on out!
And, so... you know?
You'll work hard alongside me... right?
Ahaha... Thanks, {NAME2}!
Let's work! Our! Butts! Off!
Come on, say it with me!
We'll work! Our! Buuutts! Oooff!
Hey, since we came all the way here... Wanna\nget some ice cream before we go?
One chocolate, vanilla, pistachio triple\nscoop! Oh, in a cone please!
I like being with you. As Phantom Thieves and\notherwise...
Hehe, good answer. But...
I wanna stay like this just a little longer.\nIs that okay?
Hey, {NAME2}! You free now?
I was hoping you could help me out with\nsomething.
Great! All right, let's get going.
No problem. Maybe next time!
So {NAME2}, have you ever done sprint\ntraining in the sand before?
You won't gain momentum by kicking your feet\nbackwards. You'll just get sand everywhere.
To go faster, you need to quickly lift your\nthighs to get the next step in.
That's why the beach is ideal for training.
No, I don't have the leg strength for\nthat yet.
Yeah, it's been a while so I don't think\nnow's the right time to get stuck in.
But I'm gonna start getting back into shape.
I wanna be able to sprint on the beach\neffortlessly.
So I was hoping that today you would help me\nwith my form.
Nothing too technical. Just tell me if I'm\nmaking progress or not.
It's been years since I tried running at full\nspeed on the beach.
Don't hesitate to tell me if you notice\nanything.
Okay, Coach, here I go!
Yep, another perfect day for training. Let's\ngive it our all!
The gym seems like the best place to do light\ntraining but...
The sports teams are taking up most of the\nspace.
Any ideas for workouts I can do in this small\ncorner of the gym?
Maybe strength training? But which exercise\nshould I do...?
Ah, perfect for the glutes and quads.\nNo pain, no gain I guess.
{NAME2}, could you help me count my reps?
Back to the basics, huh. They're not just\ngood for toning up. Apparently they help with\nyour posture, too!
{NAME2}, mind holding my feet down for me?
Sounds effective... and super embarrassing to\ndo alone!
Will you join me, {NAME2}?
I guess being surrounded by all these sports\nteams is kind of a good thing.
I mean, there's no way I can slack off with\nall those wandering eyes...
The thought of being seen like that motivates\nme to pull myself together.
All right, here I go! Watch me, Coach!
Hey, we got a good spot! Let's get straight\nto it!
Phew... This park is huge. Even just walking\nfeels like a workout.
Let's take a break. Good thing I brought a\ndrink.
Tada! It's a protein shake!
These days, they've been coming out with all\nsorts of flavors to enjoy your protein.
I'm only going with the plain one today\nthough. What flavor would you recommend,\n{NAME2}?
I wonder if the chocolate one would taste\nlike hot chocolate if I mix it with milk?
A blend of apple, peach, and pineapple, huh?\nThat's bound to make you feel refreshed.
I like custard, but as a protein shake?\nSounds a li'l adventurous for my taste.
But if Coach {NAME2} recommends it, then I'll\ngive it a try.
Next time we train together, I'll bring a\nshake for you too, {NAME2}!
Okay, drink break's over. Time to start\nwalking again.
I'm so tempted to buy ice cream, but that\ndefinitely won't help me tone up. Gotta\nrefrain!
Oh! I bet that's why there's so many dessert\nflavored protein shakes!
They're for people like me, who wanna stay in\nshape but still crave sweet treats!
Man, I'd love it if they had a parfait\nflavored shake... Or better yet, a chocolate\nparfait one!
With a huge park like this, there's all sorts\nof things you can do.
I couldn't think of anywhere else to train my\nreflexes other than the batting cages.
But then I remembered shooting games.
I've never really played them before, but\nI've always wanted to try.
Yeah. Anything's worth trying. So, you're in,\nright?
You sound confident! You'll have to teach me.
Training while gaming? Talk about hitting two\nbirds with one stone!
I wonder if there are other games that could\nalso double up as training?
Ah, there's the punching game. I could use my\nscore to measure progress.
What else... Crane games could help improve\nmy observational skills.
Instead of thinking of it like training,\nI should just have fun.
Sometimes instead of pushing yourself, you\ngotta let go!
So, what do you say? You up for a few rounds?
Yes! The machine I wanted to play seems to be\navailable!
Mmm, everything smells delicious! This is\njust what I need after a hunger-inducing\nworkout!
Let's hurry up and order. What should I get?
Apparently monja contains lots of water and\nfiber, so that means I can eat loads without\ngaining weight.
It's perfect to fill up after training! An\nathlete once recommended it in a magazine.
Hmmm, what should I get?
I would totally order mochi too, but those are\nhigh in carbs.
You're right. The main dish is mostly veggies\nanyway. A little extra won't cause too much\ndamage.
Oh yeah, you're right. Cheese is low in\ncarbs.
All right, I'm gonna go with your\nrecommendation. Let's order!
Oh, and {NAME2}, don't hold back on your\norder just cause I am.
Even if you get the deluxe monja with every\nsingle topping...
I promise I won't stare at you resentfully\nwhile you eat!
...I'll do my best to not even look your way!
I'm always starving after moving around a\nbunch. Now, what should I order today?
Oh, {NAME2}! Could you look at this real\nquick?
It's a list of all the new releases on\nstreaming sites...
But look at this one. Isn't that the movie\nyou said you were curious about?
Your place? As in... Like, your house?
I guess it would be more chill watching it\nthere! If you really don't mind, then...?
Oh, gotcha. Sorry. Let's watch the movie when\nyou've got time, then.
Hello?
Wait, duh. Your parents are on a trip, right?\nSo you've got the place to yourself.
It'd be kinda awkward then... The movie's got\nsome horror-y bits, after all.
You'd probably get all spooked after the\nmovie, being home all by yourself, {NAME2}.
Oh, sounds like you can deal with horror\npretty well.
I'm... actually not so good with those kinds\nof movies.
Hahaha, you've got me there.
But you can't build courage without pushing\nyourself, or something, right?
Oh! Y-yeah, true. It might not be as scary \nif I watch it with you, {NAME2}...
Oh...! T-Thanks... I might need to if it's\nthat spooky.
We're... pretty close, huh? Meh, it is just\nus here, I guess...
I'll hit play, then, 'kay?
I kinda wanna munch on something during the\nmovie. Should we get some popcorn?
Guess it'd be kinda tough to head there,\nhuh...?
No way! I really wanted this one!
Are you sure I can really have this?
Thanks, {NAME2}! I'll return the favor next\ntime!
Oh, really?
Thank you! I was just thinking I wanted one\nof this!
Where do you wanna go? I'll leave it to you.
Oh, okay. Well, let's hang out some other\ntime.
Okay! Then let's get going!
Maybe we oughta avoid that place? I dunno,\nit's like my primal instincts are telling me\nto stay away...
I figured you'd be showing up soon.
What happened to you? You've gained so much\npower in such a short span of time.
Ah... I see you don't recognize me. I'd\nprefer you introduce yourself first, but...
I haven't seen you among the freshmen, so you\nmust be an upperclassman. Fine then.
Heh, polite to your inferiors, are you?\nThere's no need for that. Let me offer\nrespect where it is due.
In that vein, I will call you...\n{NAME1}-san. Yes, that will do nicely.
Please call me Kiyoshi.
Yes, indeed... I am more than prepared.\n{NAME1}-san...
For you to be here now of all times... That\nmeans you've come to see me, yes?
Heh. You're talking to Kiyoshi Kurotani,\nremember?
In that case... It must be fate. An\ninevitable result of our respective\ncircumstances.
I can't say I fully understand myself. If\npushed, I suppose I'd call it... fate.
I've been waiting for someone like you.\nA chosen one, guided by destiny.
Ah, apologies. I should start from the\nbeginning.
You are aware of the many threats haunting\nthis school's hallowed halls, aren't you?
Wait, you don't know!? But you're "chosen"!
The truth is, I am also "chosen." Chosen to\nprotect our school.
Please, hear me out! This affects you too.
Not one to rely solely on my powers alone,\nI researched my suspicions day and night,\nuntil I discovered the truth.
This school is plagued by paranormal\nphenomena of all kinds!
These days everyone talks about Menaces, but\nI don't care for that sort of thing.
Mysteries, strange incidents... Without\ndetermining their cause, these inexplicable\noccurrences haunt the mind, do they not?
Wonderful, {NAME1}-san! I'm glad we're on\nthe same page.
Excellent, {NAME1}-san! You've picked up on\nmy main point.
If nothing is done, the students of this\nschool will fall prey to the forces of\ndarkness.
Somebody has to solve the mysteries\nthreatening these halls before they can harm\nthe innocent.
And that somebody is the chosen one. Ah...
I suppose it's the chosen ones, now that I've\nfound you.
Well, perhaps my explanation is still getting\nahead of itself.
Listen, {NAME1}-san. You and I have been\nchosen by the world itself.
You have a special power, don't you? It's\nhard to put into words, but...
{NAME1}-san... You possess a multitude of\npowers within your singular self, correct?
You can't hide it from me. Heheheh...
{NAME1}-san, you and I are bound by destiny.\nWe're kindred spirits, so to speak.
And as a fellow chosen one, I understand.\nEveryday life just gets so boring,\ndoesn't it?
You don't have to say anything, I already\nknow. I understand! And I know how painful\nit is...
So, to protect our school from the forces\nthreatening to devour it, and to fend off the\nboredom plaguing us gifted individuals\u2014
We shall act as the chosen ones! We don't\nstand to lose anything... I think.
Um, if you did join me, I could... give you\nsome of my favorite books!
Ones that are out of print. The kind you can't\nbuy anymore. I've got a lot like that.
So, please. Accept me as a kindred spirit,\nand let us do whatever it takes to protect\nthis school!
Oh, thank you!
I'm usually in the library after school, but\nlet's trade contact info just in case.
Heh, the "chosen" contact info!
All right, let's leave it here for today.\nI'll continue on with my research of the\nparanormal.
Oh, here's the book I promised. Consider\nit... proof of our resolve and a memento of\nour fated meeting.
Heh, a cool introduction. As I expected.
That's fine to start with! We can work\nthings out together!
I thought you'd be by soon. We chosen ones\nare naturally drawn together after all.
I've identified one of the school's\nmysterious incidents, and I'm ready to go\nface it. Are you?
Really!? Hurra\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nI thought so.
In that case, let us proceed at once to the\nHarrowed Grounds.
Time is short. We must hurry! Hopefully we're\nnot already too late!
Oh, I see...
Come to think of it, I have urgent business\nto attend to as well. Let's look into it\nnext time.
Here we are. These are the dreaded Harrowed\nGrounds.
Following school rumors and my own research,\nI was finally able to confirm its location.
My most feared premonition has proven true.\nTo think it's already progressed this far!
See how no plants grow in this spot? This\nmeans his sinister corpse will soon arise!
In ancient times, there was a hero who felled\na great demon that had brought ruin to the\nworld.
But the demon could not be completely erased.\nTherefore, the hero sealed its corpse away.
Were that demon to rise again, we would be\nforced to... c-call the police?
A warning, {NAME1}-san. Do not step in that\nspot! No matter what!
What are you doing!? Wait! Are you being\ncontrolled by the demon!?
What are you kids doing out here?
Sir, flee this place! Quickly! The curse will\ntake you too!
Agh, they're at it again!
There's a bunch of cat poop over here. You'd\nbetter steer clear if you like having clean\nshoes.
Cat... poop?
We have to clean up this spot every few days.\nThe grass even stopped growing after a while!
Then... The Harrowed Grounds...
Someone must be feeding stray cats around\nhere, so they keep coming back. Not you,\nright? Ah well.
Ah, I'm sorry!
I uh, was just about to let go!
Ah, I'm sorry. I actually do strength\ntraining every morning.
So the truth behind the Harrowed Grounds,\none of the school's terrifyingly threatening\nmysteries...
...was cat poop all along. Though, I suppose\npoop is threatening in its own way...
Anticlimactic as it may be, us chosen ones\nhave uncovered the truth together.
Let's think of it that way, {NAME1}-san.
I wonder if that teacher might be an agent of\nsome secret organization.
The cat poop story could be a cover-up to\nhide the truth about the demon's sinister\ncorpse!
No, the chosen ones should not betray a man\nwho's shown us such kindness.
No, we'd better not. We are the chosen ones,\nafter all.
Oh, right! Here's your book!
I was just about to message you. We chosen\nones are naturally drawn together, aren't we?
I've managed to narrow in on one of the\nschool's mysterious incidents, and I'm ready\nto face it. Will you join me?
Really!? Yaaa\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nI expected as much.
In that case, let us proceed at once to the\nHall of Lament.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please do\nremember to keep your wits about you.
Time is short. Let us get going. I'll fill\nyou in on the details there.
Is that so...?
As a matter of fact, I have pressing matters\nto attend to myself. Let's look into it\nanother time.
This is it. The fabled Hall of Lament.
According to my investigation, a woman's\nwailing can be heard here after school.
Apparently those who hear her voice meet with\ngreat misfortune.
This rumor is well known, so there haven't\nbeen any recent victims. But we can't leave\nthis problem to fester.
I'm sure it's a resentful spirit manifesting\nhere. Before it claims another victim,\nwe must...
S-Scared? Not exactly. I'm just not good\nwith, you know, Japanese horror movie stuff?
I mean, don't those kinds of entities always\nseem to come back even after the case is\nsolved?
Oh, I'm sorry. Um... Please let me stay\nlike this.
Uhuhu... Uhuhuuu...
What was that!?
Uhuuu... Aaah... Agh!
Hey, the sound is getting closer, isn't it!?\nWe've been detected by the enemy!
I know this isn't something people normally\nsay in real life, but could you promise me\nsomething?
No matter what happens to me here...
Please save yourself, {NAME1}-san!
Uwaaaooo... Aaah!
Run! You promised!
{NAME1}-san...
Huh!? Oh... That's fine, but...
You are joking, right!?
Hu... Ah... Haaa!
Waaagh!?
Um... Huh...?
Aaaah!
Uh, hey...
'Sup?
So the truth behind the Hall of Lament was...\nbawling out your feelings.
Anyone who hears that wailing is bound to\nlose sleep. And sleep deprivation begets\nmisfortune.
Um, can we please keep the truth between the\ntwo of us?
I'm sure they're not able to cry their heart\nout at home, so they let their stress out\nhere.
If that hallway remains a threat, I don't\nthink anyone will come disturb her.
It's a good thing you were here to help me\nfind the truth, {NAME1}-san.
That much I can say for certain...
Still, that stage crying was pretty intense.\nI think it's going to haunt my dreams...
Am I a victim of the Hall of Lament?
I was just about to contact you. The chosen\nones truly are drawn together.
I've discovered one of the school's\nmysterious ongoings, and I'm ready to\ninvestigate. What say you?
Really!? Aweso\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nof course.
In that case, let's hurry and pursue the\nmystery of the Assassin's Juice.
Yes, correct. We are talking about\nassassination here. I'm on my guard as well.
That it does, {NAME1}-san. I'm on my\nguard too.
This time I should share what I know before\nwe get there.
There's a particular kind of juice sold in\nthe school shop.
This juice is always sold out, so very few\nstudents have actually laid eyes on it.
Indeed, which makes it a hot topic. Anyone\nactually drinking it is bound to draw\nattention.
At first, I thought the same. But there's\nmore to the story.
Gaining something many covet can leave a\ntarget on your back.
We all know how frenzied people can get when\nthey're after a certain game or special pair\nof shoes.
So here's my theory, {NAME1}-san.
It's not that no one has ever seen this\njuice.
It's that those who've tasted it have\nvanished from this world.
Apologies, I got a bit carried away there.
Let's head to the school shop. Today's the\nday the juice is delivered.
Ah, is that right...?
Actually, I'm busy too. Let's look into this\nnext time.
I've confirmed the supply truck's arrival.\nThe restock must be in progress.
If anything occurs, I expect it to be when\nthe juice is put out for sale.
Um... The usual...
Take-kun?
Thanks. See you... next time...
That box... It can't be!
My god, it was Take-kun! He bought out all of\nthe juice!
And it seems he's been buying boxes like this\nafter every restock recently.
Yes indeed. It was the Assassin's Juice.
That, I do not know...
We must go after Take-kun at once!
Take-kun!
Kurotani-kun and... Who are you?
{NAME1}-san, a second year. He is a kindred\nspirit. One of the chosen ones.
You're really still doing that stuff?
Incidentally, that box you're carrying...\nIt's juice, correct? Why buy the whole box?
Oh, uh... I was really thirsty! I just had to\nhave this juice!
Still, isn't that a bit much? I don't think\nyou could possibly drink it all alone.
It's fine, you can go. Sorry for\nstopping you.
Kazuki Take...
Yes. Solving the mysteries threatening this\nschool sometimes requires swift judgments\nlike this.
We proceed with our investigation, of course.\nWe aren't nearly finished yet.
This mystery keeps getting juicer. Now that\nwe know Take is the one buying it up,\nI believe murder is less likely.
After all, he's clearly alive enough to make\nit to school every day. But now we have a new\nproblem.
As you can likely tell by looking at him,\nTake-kun isn't the type to make bold moves...
No matter how much he claims to love juice.
To discover why he keeps buying all the\njuice, we must launch Operation X.
To find the truth behind Take's juice\ncraving, we let him go for now. That is\nOperation X.
Uh, and the success of this operation will\ndepend on your participation, so...
You won't back out on me now... right?
It's just my intuition, but I sensed a\nstrange aura from Take-kun.
Ah, excuse me. We were going to leave things\nhere for today, weren't we?
I was just going to message you. We chosen\nones truly are in sync.
You remember the Assassin's Juice incident,\nyes? One of the mysteries threatening our\nschool?
Juice restock day is upon us once again.\nI'm ready to pursue this mystery. How\nabout you?
Really!? Yea\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean, I thought\nas much.
Let's proceed to the school shop. Take-kun is\nsure to be there too.
Ah, well...
Actually, I have something to do too. Let's\ninvestigate next time.
I've investigated further since last time,\nand it's clear Take isn't drinking that\njuice.
So I've been formulating a theory.
There's a mastermind using Take to buy up the\njuice. I don't know who it is, but...
To find out, we'll need to follow Take-kun\nwhen he... Hm? Oh, there he is.
Let's tail him, {NAME1}-san.
It looks like he's heading for the shoe\nlockers.
He's... leaving the school grounds!?\nTake-kun, you fiend, what are you up to?
Good boy, Take-chan!
That voice... Let's go!
Look at you, bringing us the goods again!
Man, what a haul! We're practically swimming\nin this stuff! Bottoms up!
Eugh, this is gross!
Heh. It's supposed to be gross. It's Durian\nau Lait!
It's nasty at first, but once you get a taste\nfor it, the flavor's addictive!
Um... Do you guys think this could maybe...\nbe the last time?
What, don't have the money? Nah, that can't\nbe! Your folks have that private practice\ndough!
They only sell this stuff at the school\nstore, so we gotta depend on you, pal!\nYou wouldn't let us down now, right?
'Less... You made some fancy new friends at\nKokatsu you like better than us?
N-No, that's not it. I'll always be your...\nfriend...
Then we'll be countin' on ya! We wouldn't\nwanna see our little friend get hurt, would\nwe, guys?
So this is the aura I sensed from Take-kun...
It looks like those three are the\nmasterminds! This... This is...!
Isn't this too over-the-top? It's like we're\nin an old TV drama.
Ah! Ow... S-Stop...
Wha...?
Oh, yes! And you watch mine!
I, I...
I...!
We have to act according to our values. Tough\nto be sure, but such is the path of a chosen\none...
Witness the might of Kiyoshi Kurotani!
Thinkin' little Take-chan needs a punishment\nfor insulting our friendship.
Ah, this takes me back! Middle school was\nfun, huh?
Please... stop...
Haha. But for real, don't go too hard on him\nthis time guys, all right?
F-F-Freeze, punks!
Kurotani-kun!?
"Freeze, punks"? What is this, a cop show?
What the hell? You narc on us, Take-chan?
{NAME1}-san, Take-kun, take cover! I'm about\nto unleash my true power!
I may suffer some damage too...
The hell's wrong with this guy?
Hiyaaaaaaaaah!
Whoa! Stop screamin'!
Hwooooooaaaaaaah!
Damn, his screaming's gonna get us busted!\nLet's get outta here!
Get over here, Take-chan!
*gasp* *pant* *pant*
I think I used... too much... power...
But... I did it, didn't I? The mystery of the\nAssassin's Juice is solved!
Heh, so what did you think? Wasn't I\nglorious?
Heh, what are you talking about?
I knew that if worst came to worst, you'd be\nthere to back me up, {NAME1}-san.
That's why I decided to unleash my power.\nThis was our victory.
But even with the mystery solved, it seems\nTake-kun is still under threat.
As the one chosen to protect this school,\nmy duty here has yet to be fulfilled.
However, at this time, I have no choice but\nto rest and recover my power... So...\ntired...
{NAME1}-san, I've detected another threat,\nso I'm going to have to survey the area.
I need to check out a student hot spot. Can\nyou come?
Excellent, fellow chosen one. Let's go\ninvestigate.
Oh, I see. Ping me next time you're\navailable.
So this is Shibuya! Rumor has it the people\nhere radiate with the aura of the sun.
It's not the most ideal environment for us\nchosen ones, who battle the forces of\ndarkness from the shadows...
Y-Yeah, I know, right!? It's not just me!
Ah! A-Apologies. I lost my composure for a\nsecond there.
Wh... {NAME1}-san!? I was most certain we\nwere comrades.
I... I suppose we can still make this work.\nAs a warrior of the dark, I welcome you as my\nally of the light.
Anyway, let's start investigating. Let's see\nwhat intel we can gather from the young\npeople here.
And keep an ear out for anything that might\nbe related to the threat.
Oh, have you tried the new dessert from the\ncaf\xe9 by the station?
Not yet! We should go get some now!
The caf\xe9 by the station... A new dessert...
{NAME1}-san, could this be...
It could be a demonic dessert made to lure in\nunsuspecting youths. A new threat!
This calls for further investigation.\nWe should go to this caf\xe9 at once!
Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as they\nsay. We ought to feign naivety and just play\nalong.
I-I most certainly do not! This is purely for\nthe purpose of investigation.
In any case, it's best to strike while the\niron is hot. Let's follow those two!
This is as good as enemy territory to me.\nLet's tread carefully while we investigate...
Wow... What a view. This really is the\nmodern-day Tower of Babel.
I do worry whether its construction incited\nthe wrath of the gods, but...
Oh, look! That's my neighborhood over there!\nI wonder if I can see my house?
Pardon me. It seems I got a little too\nexcited.
So, can you see your house from here,\n{NAME1}-san? Which side would it be?
W-Well, it's not as if there aren't taller\nbuildings in the world, is it?
I presume the deities would focus their\nefforts on the largest first. In the\nmeantime, let's enjoy the view.
You know, there aren't as many people our age\nhere as I expected.
And most visitors appear to have come with\ntheir significant other. Do you think we look\nout of place?
Y-You're right! We're kindred spirits, after\nall... Our bond is stronger than any\ncouple's.
Huh!? No, that would be... You're joking,\nright? Very funny, {NAME1}-san.
...You ARE joking, right?
Ahem! Well, while we're here, why don't we\ndrop by the gift shop on our way out?
I collect pennants, you know. I wonder if\nthey sell one for this place?
We are about to step foot into what can only\nbe described as "threat central." Nothing but\nnasties as far as the eye can see!
Shinjuku... It's as shady as the rumors say.\nThe scent of a threat is thick in the air.
Proceed with caution, {NAME1}-san.
We might run into some conventional crime\nbefore we find the real threat.
Indeed. A moment's negligence here, and we\ncould be stripped of all we have.
{NAME1}-san, if anything happens to me,\njust call the cops, okay?
R-Really? Do you actually come here often,\nthen?
Oh, {NAME1}-san, I knew I could count on\nyou! Especially today it seems.
In any case, I've heard there's a store here\nthat sells highly specialized books.
I must admit, I have quite the discerning eye\nwhen it comes to reading material, so it\ncaught my interest.
Does it not seem like the kind of place where\nwe could uncover information on the threat?
I heard there's a theater that shows cult\nclassics, and a store with luxury plant food!
Heh... I suppose even I can't help but be\nenticed by the darkness of temptation...
Ah, no adult stores though, got it? Let's\nkeep our survey within the bounds of the law.
It stinks of festering demons here... Always\ngives me the creeps.
Wow... I knew about the dome, but I didn't\nknow there was a park like this too.
I have no interest in sports, but this looks\nlike fun...
...Ahem. Of course, we didn't come here to\nplay around.
Our investigation comes first and foremost.\nNow, let's gather information from the young\nvisitors.
Well, when you put it that way, I suppose\na survey of the entire park is highly\nwarranted.
We really ought to test the safety of these\nrides ourselves!
R-Really? Well, if you insist, {NAME1}-san.
Then I suppose I have no choice but to join\nyou. Us kindred spirits must always stick\ntogether.
What shall we try first, then? Maybe we\nshould get a park pass?
P-Please, {NAME1}-san. The fate of our\nmission depends on it. Really.
You really like rollercoasters, don't you?\nAnd... I have also been curious to try\nit out!
All right, this park won't investigate\nitself. Let's start from that ride over\nthere!
No new attractions, huh. Wouldn't be\nsurprised if we found a dangerous spirit\nlurking between its steel walls...
And here we are. This noodle place has been\nthe talk of the school lately...
Places like this are great for eavesdropping\non other customers.
That's the best way to get hold of new\ninformation. What do you say?
Right? Being a slow eater like myself has its\nperks\u2014uh, I mean, never mind.
Understandable, but we're here to\ninvestigate, remember?
All right, we'd better get in line too. Keep\nyour ears open in the queue!
So this is the infamous shoyu chicken broth!\nWhat a beautiful clear soup!
I'm glad it's packed with bean sprouts. The\ncrunchy texture really stands out.
When it comes to the egg, some prefer it\nwith, but I for one, shall go without. The\nreason being...
Oh, we shouldn't let the noodles get too\nsoft! Let's dig in, {NAME1}-san!
Now, what to do for today's investigation...\nDo we follow the beaten path or try something\nnew? That is the question.
I-Is this...? Wow, you really pegged me down\nto a T!
How do you do it, {NAME1}-san? It's like you\ncan see right through me.
Yes, I'll gladly accept. How can I turn down\nsuch a kind offer?
Huh, you're giving this to me...?
T-Thanks. I don't really get gifts, so...\nIt means a lot.
You there! Excuse me!
Over here!
May I have your land? I'll pay you for it!
You need more money? Here's more!
Ahaha. The pleasure of expanding your land\nholdings... There's nothing quite like it.
The feeling of infinite possibility once\nyou've cleared it for farming... It's\nirresistible!
Nothing's better than a huge plot of open\nland!
It sure is! I'm on cloud nine!
Oh my goodness! I forgot to introduce myself.
Oh no! I haven't introduced myself yet.
I was just planning to contact you. The\nchosen ones just can't be kept apart,\ncan they?
There's something I'd like your help with\ntoday, if that's all right.
Really!? Thank goodne\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nas expected.
Now let us make haste. Follow me!
Oh, all right...
Silly me, I'm also extremely busy at the\nmoment... Let's look into it later.
No one actually uses the audiovisual room\nnowadays.
Everyone has their own smartphone or tablet\nclose at hand after all.
But that's not the only reason no one\ncomes here...
Years ago, a female student entered this room\nto shut off the lights.
In a twist of misfortune, she became locked\ninside.
But the lab had already fallen out of use\nback then.
No one knew the girl was trapped inside,\nand eventually she starved to death.
Such is the strange tale of the Evil AV Room\nwhere we stand now.
Heh, we will investigate of course.\nHowever...
Heh, that's not all!
Heh, you see right through me. I suppose I\ncan't hide such things from a kindred spirit.
This morning, I found a love letter from a\nfemale student in my shoe locker.
It said to meet her in the audiovisual room\ntoday after classes.
I've never experienced something like this\nbefore, so I wasn't sure how to proceed.
So I thought it would be best if you were\npresent for this, {NAME1}-san.
Thanks, {NAME1}-san! You're always so quick\non the uptake.
Don't worry! As long as you conceal yourself\nin that locker over there, we...
I know. And to take place here of all places.
Ah! It won't open!
No way! Not the other door too!
No! Is this the curse of the Evil AV Room!?
Y-Yes, you're right! Calm down first. As one\nof the chosen ones I must maintain composure!
Y-Yes, you're right. We chosen ones must\nconcoct a plan to escape this predicament!
Huh? You don't mean... Someone discovered our\nidentities and laid a trap for us!?
We must think this through rationally. The\ntwo of us have the power to overcome any\ntrial.
Now, how to get out... Oh! That could work!
*pant* We're out! Thank god.
With our powers combined, we've overcome the\ncurse of the Evil AV Room!
We can't allow ourselves to get trapped\nagain! Let's get out of this place\nimmediately!
Huh!? Ah!
Wait, Take-kun? Why would he...
In any case, with your help we managed to\nslip from the Evil AV Room's cursed grasp.
So here is your usual compensation. Please,\ntake it.
I suppose my first ever love letter also\nslipped from my grasp...
I was just about to send you a message,\nbut it seems fate has drawn us chosen ones\ntogether.
There's something I'd like your help with\ntoday, if you're available.
Really!? Wooho\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nthat's what I thought you'd say.
About what happened with Take-kun at the\nAV Room... We need to ask him why he did that\nto us, right?
However, I get the feeling that he's been\navoiding me ever since the incident.
So that's where you come in, {NAME1}-san...
Well, I have something to do too. Let's do\nthis another time.
Take-kun. Do you have a minute?
All right, fine.
I'm sorry I got you guys involved in this.
They told me I had to do something bad to\nKurotani-kun and take a video of it.
Do you mean the three guys from before?
They were classmates of mine in middle\nschool.
School and family stuff has been rough for\nthem lately, so they've been on edge.
I thought if I sucked it up and just let them\nblow off steam, they'd go back to being the\ngood guys they used to be.
We may understand, but that doesn't mean\nwe agree.
{NAME1}-san is right. How long are you going\nto sacrifice yourself for them?
Yeah. I don't really know your history with\nthem, but they didn't seem like good guys\nfrom where we were standing.
Anyway, they've crossed the line now.
If things continue like this, it's just going\nto get worse for you. Are you okay with that?
I, I don't...
As the chosen protectors of this school,\nwe cannot let this go on. Agreed?
Yes! I knew you would understand,\n{NAME1}-san.
I understand your point, {NAME1}-san.\nHowever!
{NAME1}-san... No, I can't let this stand.
As the chosen ones, we must see that justice\nis made manifest!
If you "make justice manifest," what happens\nto my friends?
What? They did something bad so they should\nget what's coming to them?
That's what you're getting at, isn't it?
No, that's not what I...
I know they probably look like bad guys to\nthe two of you.
But they're my friends.
They've gotten weird recently, but... They're\nreally not bad people!
But I guess you're too self-righteous to get\nthat, Kurotani-kun.
Take-kun...
Kurotani-kun, do you ever think of anyone but\nyourself?
I just... Take-kun...
Huh? Ah, well yes, I suppose it was.
I um, suppose he has... I didn't expect him\nto defend them like that.
N-No, of course not...\nAh, wait, I guess he did.
Thank you, {NAME1}-san.
To be honest, this was such an unexpected\ndevelopment that I haven't quite\nprocessed it.
I think I'll need some time to think over\nTake-kun's words.
And I don't think it's right for us to act on\nthis without his consent either...
I suppose that's it for today. Thank you for\nyour time, {NAME1}-san.
Oh, {NAME1}-san. Apologies. I didn't see you\nthere.
I was just planning to message you actually.
Sorry to bug you, but there's something I'd\nlike to talk about.
Really!? Yea\u2014*cough* Ahem! I mean, excellent.
We can't talk here, so let's go elsewhere.
Um, actually there's a matter in need of my\nurgent attention, so we'll have to do this\nanother time...
Ah. A storm is brewing deep within\nmy heart today...
{NAME1}-san, please, have a drink.
When I was a child, I was quite sickly.
Due to my frequent hospitalizations, I was\nnever able to make any real friends.
The main thing that got me interested in the\noutside world was books about the paranormal.
And I always felt like I could see things\nnormal people could not.
Well, fortunately, as I grew older my\nphysical health improved.
But my ability to make friends did not.
I'm sorry. That was the only way I could\nthink to approach you.
I had this intuitive feeling that I could get\nalong with you.
Embarrassing as it is... it's all true.
Take-kun's words hit me hard.
It's true that I've never altered my actions\nout of concern for someone else.
Maybe that means I don't have the right to\ncriticize Take-kun after all.
{NAME1}-san... Thank you. You're right,\nI have to do what I know is right.
Of course not! Kiyoshi Kurotani is not a man\nwho meekly does as he's told.
I know, right!? Take-kun isn't dealing with\nwhat's happening to him, don't you think?
What's going on with those guys isn't right.\nThat's not what friendship should be like.
No matter what he thinks of me, I still want\nto save Take-kun.
Even if it makes him hate me in the end.
Ah, I feel much more confident about all this\nafter talking with you, {NAME1}-san!
Here's your book for today. You'll keep\nhelping me with Take-kun, right?
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani...
Now that I think of it, you're the first\nperson I've ever opened up to about my\nchildhood, {NAME1}-san.
It's... a bit of a relief actually.
I'm really glad we talked today. Now,\ndrink up!
I was about to message you. I was hoping\nyou'd help me with Take-kun...
Really!? Huzza\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean, just\nas I thought.
So could you come with me right now?
Oh, right...
Actually, I'm too busy right now anyway.\nLet's do this later.
So, apparently Take-kun is still buying up\nall of that juice.
Luckily, they're restocking today. I suspect\nhe'll be here soon.
*sigh* I'm so sick of this...
Huh!? Kurotani-kun...
If you don't want to do this anymore,\nthen don't.
I understand what you were saying before.\nActually, I'd be lying if I said I understand\ncompletely.
Because I've never had any friends to defend.
Kurotani-kun...
But even so, I can't just leave you in this\nsituation.
So let's settle this today, once and for all!\nTake us to your friends, Take-kun.
Huh? Take-chan, what's this all about?
Where's our juice? You were supposed to bring\nit today.
I told him not to.
You need to stop doing this to Take-kun.\nThis is just bullying.
Stay out of this, dumbass. We're talking to\nTake-chan.
You think you can just walk in here and talk\nshit? You oughta watch yourself!
I-I'm not scared of your threats! If you're\ngonna hit me, go ahead and try it!
No, I can't let you get involved in this...
"Because" you're his friend?
"Because" you're on his side?
"Because" you're kindred spirits?
You're saying you believe in him?
Then, I... I...!
Whoa, Take-chan...?
I've kept quiet because I know things are\nhard for you guys, but this has gone too far!
I-I'm... I'm Kurotani-kun's friend, too!
We're... friends?
Go ahead, bully me. C'mon, do it!
Take-chan...
Um, we didn't really mean to...
Hey, uh, let's get outta here.
{NAME1}-san, Take-kun... Thanks.
Ahhh, I was really scared for a minute there.
Friends, huh...
I was about to contact you. I have something\nto tell you about the Take-kun situation...
Really!? Yippe\u2014 *cough* Ahem! I mean,\nI figured you'd say that.
Can we go talk for a bit, then?
Well, I actually have something to do too,\nso let's talk another time...
I'm sure you could already guess, but...
We're celebrating today. My treat.
Apparently those three apologized to Take-kun\nafter that.
They stopped the bullying, and Take-kun says\nhe can speak his mind to them again.
I'm so relieved. Our efforts have borne\nfruit.
It's all thanks to you, {NAME1}-san. I never\ncould have managed this alone.
I know. But I think Take-kun will be able to\nstand up for himself from now on.
Heh, that did happen. Are you still holding\nthat against them?
Anyway, it seems like Take-kun rethought some\nthings after he saw the way you looked out\nfor me.
I don't think he's going to put up with bad\ntreatment from his friends anymore. So that's\na relief.
I know I said before that I don't fully\nunderstand friendship...
But I think I've realized some things after\nall of this.
There isn't one right way to be a good\nfriend.
I don't think I could explain it succinctly.
It's true. He's the one who taught me what it\nmeans to be someone's friend.
Friends might step back and support you from\nthe side-lines, like you did...
Or they might step in to take a blow for you,\nlike Take-kun did. Both are true signs of\nfriendship.
I'm really glad that Take-kun and I became\nfriends in the end.
I think I'm realizing that friendships really\ndepend on the way you treat the other person.
That's one of the things I've learned from\nyou, {NAME1}-san.
There are people out there willing to be\nfriends with me.
It doesn't have to be just me and my books\nand urban legends against the universe\nanymore.
I feel like a whole new world has opened up\nfor me.
So it is with extra special thanks that I\ngive you this rare book.
Oh, but I do still want to continue our\ninvestigations together. Is that all right\nwith you, {NAME1}-san?
We are the chosen ones after all.
And we're not only friends, but kindred\nspirits reunited from our past lives!
Oh, you. Uh... Been a while.
Welp, bye.
Don't you get tired being around that? She\nscares me a little, honestly.
I mean, I guess if you don't mind then\nit's fine.
Are you, by any chance...
N-No, I'm not Yui! I'm her friend!
Oh yes, I am. If you know that, you\nmust be...
Ah, Yui's told me about you.
It's nice you're willing to use that name in\nreal life as well. I'm glad you took to it.
You're younger than me. Oh boy...
Oh god, did you think I'd be the same age\nas you?
You must have. If you didn't, you wouldn't\nhave come.
I'm sure you didn't expect an adult, haha...
Ummm, should we cancel?
But I guess you already came all the\nway here...
Well, let's just go inside.
Let's start over.
Haha... Thank you.
Haha... You must be surprised.
You showed up only to find a grown adult\nwaiting for you.
Oh yes, she's doing well. She'll be on the\nfarm again today, I'm sure.
Ummm, so your name is...
{PLAYER_NAME}? I see.
And you seem to be a high school student.
Well, it's okay. We're just having burgers.
I work for an IT company. Our office is\nactually right here in Shibuya.
Today, I was dealing with a system-wide\nissue. I didn't even have time to eat.
But then you invited me, so I took off for\nlunch break and here I am.
We should hurry up and order. I'll have a\nlarge hamburger and fries.
This is massive!
We could have ordered just one for both\nof us.
I'm full... I couldn't eat another bite.
The french fries were delicious.
I bet their potatoes were grown on a\nmagnificent farm.
I'm sure this isn't all that interesting to\nyou, but I actually grew up on a farm.
It's up in the mountains, so it takes over an\nhour by bus to get there.
It's really the middle of nowhere, so in\nterms of finding a job, it was either move\nto the city or become a farmer.
But I absolutely can't stand insects. I hate\ntheir creepy crawly little legs.
So I decided to move to the city.
There are days like today where I'm so busy\nthat I don't even have time to eat.
Sometimes I think that working on the farm at\nmy parents' place wouldn't be so bad.
When Yui started doing virtual farming, I was\nenvious.
Yui tells me she has an absolute blast\ngrowing crops with you.
Like me, she doesn't have many friends.\nI hope you'll continue to be friends\nwith her.
Hahaha...
Hello, this is Matsukata. Yes. Understood.
Sorry. That was my office. They need me back.
We'll have to call it here.
The miseries of the working world. Haha...
She should be at the farm later. I hope\nyou'll see her there.
Don't worry about it. I invited you.
As an adult with a full-time job, I can't ask\na high school kid to pay.
Russet! You're here! One moment!
I finished work a little early, so I thought\nI'd invite you out.
I'm glad you agreed to come. Oh, let me get\nyou some coffee.
I'll just pop over to the convenience store\nthere.
Remember when Yui couldn't go to the fields\nfor a while?
You know, back during the mole infestation?
I was dealing with a lot then as well.\nI practically lived at the office.
It all started when one of my colleagues\nmade a mistake and then disappeared into\nthin air.
They're still radio silent even now. Hahaha.
At that time, I felt like I just hated\neverything.
So, I was really frustrated that there was\ntrouble to deal with on our farm as well.
Anyway, that's how I was feeling at the time.
But when I happened to log back in...
I found that you had taken care of the fields\nfor me.
When I saw that, I felt ashamed of myself for\nwhining about how bad I have it.
I made up my mind that I'd do everything in\nmy power to fix things for myself!
And somehow I dug myself out of the heap\nI was buried under.
So basically what I'm trying to say is,\nI want to thank you.
Getting to have peace of mind is really\nimportant to me.
Now that I have some free time, I've even\nbeen thinking about growing something at\nmy place.
I'm planning to go to the flower shop after\nthis. Would you mind coming along and giving\nme some advice?
There's a flower shop in the underground\nmall. Let's go.
Wow. For a small store, it sure has a lot of\noptions.
Any ideas to help me choose what to get?
Right. My situation's gotten better, but I\nshouldn't get a plant that needs too much\nattention to survive.
This one... Ah, I have to water it both in\nthe morning and afternoon. That's a bit of\na hassle.
Wait, there's a device that waters your\nplants for you!? Oh, but it's pretty\nexpensive.
Oh, that's not a problem. My room gets plenty\nof sunlight.
I'm the type who can't wake up in the morning\nunless there's sunlight coming through the\nwindow.
So what should I buy? This? Ah, no.
This one is sensitive to strong sunlight.\nDon't think we'll get along.
You mean I should pick on instinct? Hmm...
Okay, this one!
Whoa, pricey! How is a plant that expensive?\nHaha... I can't afford that.
I see. Maybe this one will do then.
Hmmm. Basil seedlings...
Basil is pretty nice. You can use it in pasta\nand stuff.
I'll go with this. Thanks, {NAME1}-san.\nI couldn't have made this choice without you.
I'll do everything in my power to keep it\nhealthy.
I will. And I'm ready to deal with any gross\nbugs that... Oh wait, I lied. I totally\nforgot.
Oh! How stupid am I!? I forgot the most\nimportant thing!
I'll have to buy some insect repellent.
This should do the trick.
You know, I have to train a new employee\nwho's joining the company tomorrow.
I know I can't avoid it, but I'm really not\ngood with people.
But I'll try my best, just like I will with\nthis basil.
*yawn*
Sorry. My internal clock has been way out of\nwhack since everything got crazy with work.
Maybe taking care of this plant will help me\nget back into a healthier rhythm.
I think I'll try to go to bed early today.
Let's call it here. Thank you for\naccompanying me.
I hope to see you on the farm.
An online world? ...I see, a transient\nelectronic realm separated from reality.
Places such as this may contain dormant\ndesires that cannot be attained in the\nreal world.
This could be an opportunity to refine your\nown desires. There is no harm in giving it\na try.
Are you going to log on to\nHarvest World Online?
That friend of yours does not appear to be\nonline today...
Regardless of whether you meet or not, that\nplot of land is what keeps you connected in\nmore ways than you think.
Oh! Hey, {NAME1}-kun. Are you busy today?
I've um... found a part-time job. I thought\nwe could check it out together maybe?
Really? Great!
I was a little nervous about going by myself\ntoday...
Well, let's just go and see!
Ah... All right. Um, sorry for asking out of\nthe blue.
I, um... I don't come to shops like this a\nlot. Sports shops, sure. Well, back before...\nYou know... Haha.
The places we worked at before were all\nstores I've been to myself.
I wanted to try working someplace I wasn't\nused to, so I chose this place.
I'm glad you came with me, {NAME1}-kun...
I don't think I could've done this on\nmy own...
So many different accessories...
I haven't worn stuff like this before, so I'm\nkind of lost...
Oh! But since I'm working here, I should wear\nsomething to show off the product, right!?
Um, how is this one? Does it look okay on me?
Really? You think so!? Oh wow... Maybe I'll\nbuy these on the way out.
Oh! Subdued would be better? I'll, uh, keep\nthat in mind!
What? Like, as a set!? Hmmm, I wonder if\nI have enough for both...
Hehe... It's a good thing I asked you.
This stuff isn't exactly my forte, but with\nyou here, {NAME1}...
I think it'll be just fine.
When I first started these jobs, I felt like\nI was in some sort of weird dream.
Like a lucid dream, where you suddenly\nrealize you're in it.
I'd think to myself, "What am I doing in this\nshop? Shouldn't I be on the field?"
"I have to wake up. I have to eat breakfast\nand get to morning training." I felt\npanicked.
But I could never wake up...
For a while, I had trouble knowing if I was\neven awake or not.
Then somewhere along the way, I started to\nfeel like...
...me aiming for the pros was the part that\nhad all been a dream.
This whole thing would've been a nightmare\nhad I gone through it by myself.
But seeing you at my side...
...helped bring me back to reality.
Lately, working these jobs doesn't feel so\nunreal anymore. So, um...
I'm just really glad you're here,\n{NAME1}-kun.
Thanks, {NAME1}-kun.
Not true. Having you here gives me courage.
Yeah, I think you're right! If things keep\ngoing like this, then one day...!
Oh hey, isn't this the accessory that was all\nover social media for a while?
That figure skater wore it in her off time.
What was her name again? You know, the one\nthat fell off the face of the earth.
Huh? Who? Did she retire or something?
She's right. Kotone-san used to wear this...\nEven I heard about that. It was everywhere.
Look how pretty it is. Something like that\nwouldn't suit me at all.
I wonder how Kotone-san's doing...
Unlike me, it sounds like her injury might\nrecover completely with rehabilitation.
She said she wanted to go back soon if\nshe could.
Yeah... I know part of me's projecting my own\nworries onto her, but still...
I... don't really know.
Ahaha... We probably shouldn't. I think we'd\njust get in the way.
Still, I'd like to do anything I can to offer\nher some support.
I don't want Kotone-san to feel the pain of\nbeing unable to return to what you love....
She said she comes around Shibuya Station a\nlot, right? I hope we get to see her again...
If it's all right with you, {NAME1}-kun,\nwould you mind coming to work with me again\nsometime?
Anyway, we've got a job to do! Better focus\non our work.
Welcome!
Hi, {NAME1}-kun. Are you free today?
I found a nice-looking job in Shibuya, and\nthought we could go check it out.
Really? Okay, then let's go! This time we're\nworking at a flower shop!
Ah, okay. No worries, then. Sorry for asking\nso suddenly.
It's much harder to work at a flower shop\nthan one might think.
I wanted to be a florist at one point, you\nknow. Back in kindergarten.
Wanted to run a cr\xeaperie too now that I think\nabout it. I was a greedy little gremlin, huh?
But working here now is totally different\nthan what I imagined as a kid.
I had this image of making customers smile\nwith these beautiful bouquets of flowers...
But boxes of flowers and potted plants weigh\na ton! And making bouquets is exhausting.
It's been a while since I've done heavy\nlabor like this. Reminds me of my baseball\ntraining.
Huh... Now that you mention it, maybe?
Yep, totally good! If anything, this makes\nfor some good rehab.
Hmmm... Well, when you put it that way,\nI'd better put my back into it, huh?
Ah... Pardon me.
Oh, Kotone-san!
Oh! Tomoko-san! And {NAME2}-kun! You're\nworking here today?
Yessiree! Today you're talking to a couple of\nflorists! What can we do for you?
Would you happen to have any, um, chamomile?\nI'd like to make a bouquet out of some.
Hmm, chamomile... We have some left in stock,\nbut not much, to be honest.
About how big of a bouquet were you thinking?\nJust to give us an idea.
How big? Hmmm... About... this size?
Yikes... That's pretty big! When would you\nneed it by?
Today? If possible...
Today!?
I'm sorry. It isn't feasible, is it?\nI shouldn't have made such a big request\nso suddenly...
Um, is there a specific reason you need it\ntoday, if you don't mind me asking?
Yesterday I had some... words with my coach.\nOkay, a fight, actually.
When I think back on it calmly, I was in the\nwrong. So I'd really like to offer the\nbouquet today if I can.
For now I'll take as many chamomiles as you\nhave. Then I'll try filling out the bouquet\nat other shops.
Hold on a second!
Um, say, {NAME1}-kun... Do you think we can\nhelp her out with those chamomiles somehow?
Kotone-san really needs them, right? And I\nreally want to help her. We have to do\nsomething...
Never you fear, I have a plan! There should\nstill be enough time to pull it off.
You're right! We're a couple of pros today!\nWe've got this!
Could you give us a little time? I promise\nwe'll make it happen!
Ah, well... I do have the time, but... Are\nyou, um, sure you don't mind?
Let me see if any of the other branches have\nchamomile in stock!
I'll use the shop's smartphone! If I find any\nin stock, I'll run on over to get them!
Oh, and our distributor hasn't come today.\nIf we call them now, maybe they can make it!
Could you make the call, {NAME1}-kun?
Thanks for waiting! Here you are! One\nchamomile bouquet!
Amazing... You really did it!
Careful, it's pretty heavy.
I'm afraid it'll be a little expensive, given\nhow we got all the flowers...
Oh please, don't worry about that. I'm just\nimpressed!
Oh, pshaw! That's what being a florist's all\nabout!
Tomoko-san, {NAME2}-kun, thank you so much.\nI hope to see you again!
Phew... Thank goodness we made it in time.
I just hope we helped her a little...
Is that so? Well, that would please me\ngreatly.
Yeah, you're right. It was nice to see that\nsmile on her face.
You really think so? Hehehehe...!
Thanks for all your help.
I hope Kotone-san makes up with her coach.
Our shift's just about over! Let's do our\nbest by these blooms until then!
Hi, {NAME1}-kun. Would you happen to be free\ntoday?
I'm about to head to a part-time job, and I\nwas wondering if you'd like to join me.
Yeah? Great! Let's go!
Sure, no worries! Sorry for the last-minute\ninvitation.
I've been working here a lot on my own\nlately.
Thought I should try taking the field without\nbackup.
Hehe... Praise feels pretty good!
I know. Honestly, having you around makes me\nfeel a lot more at ease.
How would you like the "Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy\nSpaghetti"? Today's the last day for this\nlimited-time special!
Now that I think about it, this is your first\ntime on this job, right, {NAME1}-kun?
That makes me the senior staff today!
Just ask your ol' senpai here if you need\nanything!
Just kidding. It'd be so embarrassing to say\nthat and then end up needing your help.
Thanks for coming, Tomoko-chan!
Sorry we're always calling you for the busy\nshifts.
No, not at all! Glad to be of help!
I guess that makes you her little helper for\nthe day. Pleased to meet you!
Working together with your buddy... Ain't\nyouth grand!
Anyhow, I'm going on break. I leave the floor\nto you!
Let's give it 110%!
All right, you two, you're all done.
It was great working with you! Thanks for\ntoday.
Thank you for helping out. See you next time!
I can't believe how fast that went by.
Um, do you have any plans after this,\n{NAME1}-kun?
We just got paid and all, so I thought we\ncould stop somewhere on the way home...
Oh! Tomoko-san, {NAME2}-kun.
Kotone-san!
We meet again. Are you two on your way out?
On our way home from work actually.
Is that right? I should have come a bit\nsooner.
We've been working here part-time lately.\nWe were on the floor until a minute ago.
Is that right? I would have enjoyed seeing\nthe pair of you in action.
Um, {NAME1}-kun? Our shift's over, remember?
You two worked here today then, did you? What\na shame. If only I had come earlier.
I like to come here from time to time. The\npasta is really delicious.
Have you tried the limited-time special? The\nHeaping Hot 'N' Spicy Spaghetti!?
Oh yes, that dish looked quite tasty!\nI thought I'd like to try it at least once...
But I find myself daunted by the sheer\nquantity. It must be very high in calories.
You're right about that... One plate easily\nfeeds a table of three.
Oh! What if we all split it? I wanted to give\nit a try too anyway!
Oh, really!? You would?
What do you think, {NAME1}-kun? I bet the\nthree of us could pack it away no problem!
But I do feel bad, making you follow my whims\nlike this...
What he said. Plus we wanted to try it too!\nIf it's all right with you, that is.
Yeah! Today's the last day of the special. If\nwe don't eat it now, we'll "rigate" it later!
See? {NAME1}-kun's starving. We're up for it\nif you are, Kotone-san!
If you insist, well... By all means, lead\nthe way.
Here you go! One Heaping Hot 'N' Spicy\nSpaghetti, made to order!
It looks divine! And there's so much of it...
The three of you are sharing, right? We\nadded a little extra for you.
Thanks so much, Senpai!
Oh yeah, how did things go with your coach?\nWere you able to make up?
Ah, the bouquet brouhaha. I'm so grateful for\nyour help with that.
I'm pleased to say coach beamed at the sight\nof it. She even joked, "I wonder how much tea\nthis'll make."
We were back on good terms in no time. And I\nhave you to thank for it.
And for the pasta as well! I would have\nmissed the opportunity to try it without you.
{NAME1}-kun and I had been looking for a way\nto help you.
We're just glad we could be of some support!
It's really good to see you happy,\nKotone-san.
Support...?
Um, not that you need support or anything!\nI mean, it was just me being nosy! I mean\u2014!
When I said I wanted to help, I didn't mean\nyou did anything to make me think you need\u2014!\nUm, please don't worry about this!
No, it's not that! I'm sorry, please don't\nmisunderstand!
It makes me so happy that you two would be so\nconsiderate of me this way. Truly.
It's just, um...
Is rehab not going as well as it should?
I'm sorry.
How can I say this... Recently I feel like\nI'm being driven into a corner.
Oh no... That's... I mean, that sounds so...
Yeah... I think he's right.
Extended rehab can really take a toll on you\nmentally. Trust me, I know.
Me? Um, well...
Wha\u2014!? {NAME1}-kun!? You can't just ask that\nout of nowhere!
Fine by me. Shall we exchange details as\nwell, Tomoko-chan?
You've been such a good friend to me. I trust\nyou won't spread it around, yes?
Um! If you ever have the time, Kotone-san,\nwould you want to hang out maybe!?
It would be my pleasure.
I have more than enough free time. And I\nwould like the chance to repay your kindness.\nSo by all means, I'd love to.
I can't wait to hang out with Kotone-san! I'd\nbetter start thinking of places for us to go\ntogether.
You really helped me out today in a big way.
Hey, {NAME1}-kun! Are you free?
I thought I'd try to invite Kotone-san to\nhang out... Think you could join us?
Great! The three of us can go to Odaiba!
Okey-doke. I'll let Kotone-san know that\nwe'll reschedule.
This is the first time we're hanging out\noutside of work. Kind of weird, huh,\n{NAME1}-kun?
Hehe... Yeah, you're right.
Yes! I remember all of the days we've spent\ntogether, and they were all work!
Right!? What a lovely day!
Perfect for going out. I'm glad we got to\nmeet up on a day like this.
You know, ever since that time at the diner,\nKotone-san and I have been messaging a lot.
She told me all about herself. Her family,\nwhat shops she goes to, even her favorite\nbakery!
After talking to her, I realized she's really\na totally normal person!
Still... She hasn't said anything about her\nrehab. And I'm not even sure how to ask.
Oh. {NAME1}-kun, over there. I think\nthat's her...
Oh, you're here!
Yes! Um, you weren't waiting too long,\nwere you...?
Not at all. I just arrived myself. I had\nsomething on my mind is all.
Would you two be in the mood for a meal by\nany chance? My treat! As thanks for that\npasta.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Right, we can't accept! I'd feel bad...
Wha\u2014!? No, {NAME1}-kun! You have to reject\nthe offer with grace!
Did you two let me off the hook that easily\nwhen I tried to decline your pasta proposal?
I want to foot the bill, so please, don't\nstand on ceremony. Let's have fun.
Oh boy, look at the time. Sorry for keeping\nyou out so late!
Not at all. I left the entire day open for\nthis. My docket for tomorrow is mostly empty\nas well.
I couldn't have asked for a better diversion.\nI feel so much lighter now.
Let us know when you're in the mood for\nanother one! I'll rush right over.
And, um, if you ever need to talk about\nanything, you can talk to me... Okay?
I have so many people who've supported me\nthrough my injury. {NAME1}-kun, friends,\nfamily. So if I can be there for you...
I can't go back to my dream anymore, but if\nthere's any way I can help you return to\nyours, I...!
Anyway, um, yeah...! I'm sorry. I shouldn't\nbe nosing into your business...
No, not in the least.
I've just been thinking of myself... When in\ntruth, you have it so much worse than I do.
I could make my return at any time,\nand yet...
You shouldn't rush into anything, Kotone-san!\nYour fans will understand!
People all around the world are waiting\npatiently for you to grace the rink again!
Yes... They are.
I know rehab is really hard when you're going\nthrough it, but it'll be over before you\u2014
Kotone-san!? What's wrong!?
Forgive me. It isn't what you think...
My injury... already healed. I finished rehab\na long time ago...
If you're all better, then why...?
I had already completed my rehabilitation by\nthe time we met.
I wanted to return to the ice. Truly I did.\nIt's just... I couldn't.
The moment I put skate to ice, my legs start\nto shake... and my mind goes white...
Oh no. But... why?
In the past, I would see these awful comments\nabout me online in the time leading up to\ncompetitions...
They didn't faze me at first. It's\ncommonplace in the figure skating world.
But they stuck somewhere, in some dark corner\nof my heart. Then during rehab, they started\ngetting to me.
Did anyone truly want me to succeed in the\nfirst place?
Were more people hoping to see me go through\npain and suffering in rehabilitation?
No, that's not\u2014!
I know it isn't true... In my mind, I know.\nThe problem is my heart.
That's why being around the two of you\nrelaxes me so. You're just so sincere...
You've inspired me to face this.
Thank you for today. Truly. I hope we can do\nthis again sometime.
Hey, {NAME1}-kun. Are you doing anything\ntoday?
I've just got to do something for Kotone-san.\nI can't leave her like this.
Yes, I know it's none of my business. And I\nknow it won't be easy.
But if I do nothing and then she quits figure\nskating for good, well...
I just feel like I'll be stuck forever too.
Like my heart will go back to the moment I\nfound out I'd never play baseball again.
I need your help. Or, really... I just need\nyou by my side.
I feel like I can face anything when you're\nwith me, {NAME1}-kun.
I'm so grateful, {NAME1}-kun. Really...
Ever since our first shift together, you've\nalways been there for me.
I feel like I've come so far in my recovery\nthanks to you.
I know I can't be dependent on you forever.\nI know that. It's just...
Sometimes... Sometimes I think it would be\nnice if we could stay together like this.
Thank you, {NAME1}-kun. For everything.\nPlease, stay with me... just a bit longer.
You're so kind, {NAME1}-kun.
I'll try my hardest!
I think I'll stop by a restaurant on the way\nhome. Now, diner or burger shop? Decisions,\ndecisions.
Hehe... If you talk like that, I'll never\nstop relying on you, you know?
Huh? Wait, you don't mean...
Wait, am I dreaming? When did I go to sleep?\nWait, what?
Um, {NAME1}-kun! I feel the same way!
I've felt this way about you for the longest\ntime! Really, I have!
This isn't a dream, right? If I'm going to\nwake up, now's the time...
I just don't know anymore...
Even if this is a dream... I'd be happy\nstaying like this forever.
Stay with me, {NAME1}-kun...
Okey-dokey then. Let's have that talk next\ntime you're free.
Also, I wanted to talk to you about the whole\nsituation with Kotone-san...
Really? In that case...
Let's head to the job first. Today we're\nworking at a bookstore in Shinjuku. Let's\ngive it our all!
"100 Brass Band Classics"? Whoa.
Musicians are so cool. I couldn't read sheet\nmusic if my life depended on it.
I have a few friends in the brass band at\nschool. Ah... But that's not what I wanted to talk to\nyou about.
Yeah... I know.
I read up on Kotone-san on the internet.
Apparently she's been an incredibly\nhard-working figure skater since childhood.
Then she went on to win a bunch of\ncompetitions...
That was probably around the time I first\nheard about her.
Have you heard the name "Ice Queen" before?\nThat's what people started calling her.
Her beauty had something to do with it,\nof course, but...
Around then people started trashing her\nonline. For dumb reasons like, "she seems\ncold," "she doesn't smile enough."
It made me sick reading the things they said.\nThe kind of abuses they slung at her...
Anonymous comments like that are wallpapered\nall over the internet.
People who wrote some of the more extreme\ncomments were even convicted in criminal\ncourt.
Still, a verdict can't fix the damage done to\nKotone-san's heart.
Right!? Just thinking there are people like\nthat out there makes me so mad!
Maybe a little, but not enough.
You don't have to look very far to find it.\nBut I am a sleuth with a search engine.
She's strong enough to face the pressure of a\nworldwide tournament without batting an eye,\nand yet she gets treated so horribly.
I just keep thinking, isn't there anything\nI can do about this?
I can't say for sure just how much this has\naffected Kotone-san...
...but I can imagine.
Remember how I said I'm really bad with away\ngames?
Just me in the batter's box, with the\nopposing team in front of me...
And all I can hear is the cheering of\ntheir fans...
No one there to cheer me on...
Everyone on Earth waiting for me to\nstrike out.
I knew that wasn't actually true... But in\nthat moment, it was.
Even though my teammates were there on the\nbench. Even though there were people in the\nstands who came to support me.
Heck, when Motoha came to watch me in middle\nschool...
...you could hear her cheering from the\noutfield bleachers.
But I couldn't hear their support when the\nopponent's cheers drowned them out.
Somehow, I want to make sure Kotone-san hears\nall of the people rooting for her out there.
I'm sure that's all she needs. As long as she\nhas that, it'll all work out...
Still, it's the "how" I'm drawing a blank on.\nAny ideas, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun?
We'd get teammates on the bench to shout.
As for the fans... Get them to shout even\nlouder?
But all I know is baseball...
Hehe, you see that in amateur league ball\nsometimes.
Most arenas don't allow you to bring amps\nand stuff.
I've never seen one at a figure skating\ncompetition anyway.
Since high school, we've had the brass band\ncheering us on.
They really put their backs into it, our\nschool band. Each batter gets their own\ncheer song.
No matter how loud the opposing team gets,\nthere's no way they can drown out those\ntunes.
Friends in the stands would cheer too. All of\nthem with their megaphones going...
"Let's go, To-mo-ko!" "Let's go, To-mo-ko!"
Because of all that, I never felt that\nanxiety at games anymore...
That's it...
A cheer song! By a brass band! Something like\nthat is sure to reach her!
She'll have to know we're there for her!\nWe'll prepare a cheer song just for\nKotone-san!
I'll talk to my brass band buddies! Then\nwe'll get the pep up planning powwow\nunderway!
I mean\u2014! After work, of course!
Um, {NAME1}-kun? I kind of have a favor to\nask you...
{NAME2}-kun. Do you still have time\nright now?
I want to confirm a few more details before I\npull the trigger on Kotone-san's cheer song.
So... Do you think you can stick around for a\nlittle while longer?
I know I'm being childish and acting like a\nbig buttinski here, but...
I just have to see this through.
Okay. I'm sure this'll go off without a hitch\nif you're there with me, {NAME1}-kun.
Okay. I'm sure this'll go off without a hitch\nif you're there with me, {NAME2}-kun.
Thanks, but I'm not, I swear. I just have to\nmake this happen.
Thanks for all your help!
Now, to the pep up planning powwow! It's at\nthe diner by the way. My treat!
Now then, where to hold our pep-up planning\npowwow... Where do you feel like,\n{NAME2}-kun?
Oh hey, perfect timing, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun.\nI wanted to talk to you about Kotone-san's\ncheer song.
I thought we'd try to pull it off today. What\ndo you think? Can you make it?
Okay! So here's the plan.
{NAME_COOP_8}-kun, you'll invite Kotone-san to\nschool. Anything should work, just make it\nsound natural.
I'll meet up with the brass band club in the\nmeantime, then we'll come meet you when we're\nready.
Then we'll come meet you when we're ready.
Then once Kotone-san arrives at school,\nwe'll take her to the roof, and start the\nperformance.
I'll be counting on you, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun!
I see... Well, I want you to be there when\nit happens, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun. Let me know next\ntime you're free!
Let me know next time you're free!
The brass band's primed and ready! All that's\nleft is for Kotone-san to show up.
She should be here any second...
Tomoko-san! {NAME2}-kun!
I wanted to see you two, so I came as quickly\nas I could. Why did you want to meet here?
Well, we've got a surprise for you.
Surprise? Here at the school? I wonder what\nit is.
Hehe, fair enough.
So, um... Follow us, okay? This way!
What a lovely school this is.
Isn't it about time you let me in on this\nsurprise?
Do you hear something, Kotone-san?
I hear students... practicing for a concert,\nfrom the sound of it.
That's our school's brass band. You know,\ntrumpets, trombones, stuff like that.
Back in my baseball days, they'd play at the\nstadium to cheer on our team.
This isn't the full band, but it gives you an\nidea of what a cheer song sounds like.
Oh yes, you can hear much the same at\nKoshien.
Even at away games, when cheers for the\nopposing team were really loud, I'd hear them\nplaying and I'd know...
"My friends are here."
I envy you, I admit. Figure skaters are all\nalone during their routines.
Yes... I can't say I know the feeling. That's\nwhy I wanted you to hear this, Kotone-san.
I told my friends in the brass band that\nthere's someone I had to give a cheer no\nmatter what.
And a bunch of them said yes right away!
All right, everyone! Take it away!
Hey, hey, Ko-to-ne! Hit them with that slide\nchasse!
Huuuuuh!?
They're all your fans. You should've heard\nthem grill me about how I knew you.
I didn't tell them the details, but knowing\nit was for you was more then enough to\nconvince\u2014
Um... Kotone-san?
So, that surprise...
This song... You planned this for me?
Oh, yes. It's a riff on the song they'd do\nfor me at bat. Obviously the old version was\na bit diff\u2014
Ah, that makes it sound like some sort of\nshoddy hand-me-down, doesn't it? Sorry...
I'll add this song to my program at the next\ncompetition.
Your, uh, program?
I'll skate to this.
Huuuuuuuuuh!?
Wait, you're skating in the tournament!?\nYou mean\u2014!?
There is no way I could miss this.
No matter what words are thrown my way, this\nsong will reach me.
With this, I can get back in the rink. I know\nit. I'm ready now.
Would it be all right if I stepped out to\ncall my coach for a minute? Then I'd like to\nmeet those brass band friends of yours.
I must thank you two somehow as well...\nMy, so much to do!
Yeah, you should start there. The place you\nwanted to go back most.
Good idea. If you got hurt in all the\nexcitement, I'd never forgive myself.
Hehe. The brass band said the same thing. And\nthey want a picture together.
Still, we can do that later.
Go on! I bet you're itching to strap on those\nskates, right?
Would you two become my emotional support\ncoaches!? I'm absolutely serious!
Mission successful. Thank goodness!
Really...
After I quit baseball... I was full of dread.
All I had was the game. I had no idea what I\nwas supposed to do with my life without it.
But for the first time since then, I finally\nthought...
"I'm glad I had baseball in my life."
That was kind of heavy, huh?
When you're with me, all of these feelings\njust kind of bubble up, {NAME2}-kun.
I guess I let my guard down around you. It's\na little embarrassing to be honest.
But I feel like I've finally discovered what\nI can offer this world as I am now.
Or really, because of who I am now.
Thank you again, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun.
So. Would you still come with me to my next\npart-time job?
When I'm with you, {NAME_COOP_8}-kun, I feel like\nmy next dream is right\naround the corner.
I feel like my next dream is right around the\ncorner.
Thanks! Here's to more great shifts together!
As long as we're together, we can get through\nanything.
Yeah! We'll knock it out of the park!
Let's keep doing our best tomorrow! Fight on!
Um...!
Are you free today? I kind of have a favor\nto ask...
Oh! Well, um, in that case...
So, it's um... It's a little childish\nactually. I'm kind of embarrassed to ask.
I see... That's fine. Um, sorry for asking so\nout of the blue.
The thing is, um, I'd like to get a part-time\njob. Now that I've quit baseball and all.
And I actually found a job that seems pretty\nnice! It's at a cr\xeape shop in Shibuya.
So... I was wondering if you wouldn't mind\ncoming with me to check it out?
Oh... Are you worried about me working with\nmy arm?
Well... To be completely frank, I am. Not to\nmention my arm's kind of...
Yeah. I'm totally fine now.
They said it won't heal any further than\nthis. But it doesn't hurt, or interfere with\nmy daily life at all.
At this point, it's all down to whether\nI feel ready or not. So, um, that's why\nI thought...
...if you came with me, {NAME1}-kun,\nI should be able to handle it. Probably.
Really? You will!? Thank you so much! Okay,\nI'll be ready in two seconds!
Ah, I am so glad you two showed up. Our usual\npart-timers canceled at the last minute.
Sorry about this... It looks like they got\nthe wrong idea when you showed up with me...
Sorry, thanks. I really appreciate it.
Hehehe... I suppose I do. I'll pay you back\nfor sure, just you wait!
Hearing you say that makes me feel much\nbetter... Thank you.
Okay, you kids're on cr\xeape duty. Wrapping's\na cinch, and cooking's not too hard either\nonce you're used to it.
Wait... It sounds like you're leaving us to\nfigure out the whole kit and caboodle by\nourselves.
Thing is, I'm not really good with teaching,\nsooo... Look, there's a manual for everything\nover there.
Otherwise you can look up tutorials online,\n'kay? Knock yourselves out.
Welp, g'luck kids. Byeee!
Seriously? They're just throwing us to the\nwolves? Okay, um, where's that manual...?
Let's see... So first there's different\nflavor bases... Cream... Matcha...
The recipes are pretty straightforward... For\nChoco Banana Cream, put chocolate sauce on a\ncream base, et cetera.
As for cooking the batter itself, I've seen a\nbunch of videos on the subject already.
Well, no way out but through! Ready to tackle\nthe wild world of cr\xeape making,\n{NAME1}-kun!?
T-There...!
Ohhh, now those're some good-lookin' cr\xeapes.\nYou kids are naturals.
A good thin layer, with a nice tight roll.\nThis can't be your first rodeo.
Oh, no. We just followed the manual and\nwhatnot.
It was always my dream to run a cr\xeaperie when\nI was a little girl.
Huh, you don't say?
I guess dreams really do come true!
Oh! Yes, you're right! They really do!
Looks like I can leave everything in your\ncapable hands after all. Have at it, kids!
Ah, yes, you can count on us! Ahahaha...
I've wanted to do this since way before I\never started baseball.
Consider this a dream fulfilled!
Excuse me, can we order?
Yes, one moment, please! Um, do you think you\ncould help some more, {NAME1}-kun?
Great work today, kids. We got way more\ncustomers than usual.
I put a little extra in your pay for today.\nYou've earned it.
Whew... That was way more tiring than I\nthought it would be.
But look! I finished my first part-time job!
You were a huge help today! Thanks for coming\nwith me on such short notice.
I don't think it would've gone so smoothly\nwithout your help, {NAME1}-kun.
If I keep this up, I think things should\nwork out!
Hehe! Thank you!
Well, I am still a newbie and all... This\nfeels like just the bottom of the first\ninning.
Oh, believe me, I'm aiming for the bleachers!\nAhahaha!
You know, I always struggled with playing\naway games.
Knowing somebody's supporting me in the\nstands really puts me at ease. It's kind of\nchildish I guess.
Hey, um, {NAME1}-kun?
If it's all right with you, could we work\ntogether again sometime?
When you have the time, of course! Totally\nunderstand if you can't. So, uh...?
Really? You mean it!? Yaaay! That's great!
All right! On to the next gig!
Fight on!
Oh, {NAME1}-kun!
Do you remember those part-time jobs we were\ntalking about? I found one I'd like to try.
So I thought, well... if you're free, we\ncould do it together?
Oh! Really? Then let's go! This time it's a\nbeef bowl place in Shibuya.
Oh... Well, that's all right. Sorry to spring\nthis on you.
I've never stood on this side before. It's so\nhigh up! And a little nerve-racking.
Looking forward to working with you,\n{NAME1}-kun!
By the way... About what the boss was\nsaying...
Apparently some customers have been causing\nthem trouble lately. Stuff like spiking the\nwater pitchers with spice...
Uploading pictures of leftover beef bowls\nthey've tossed onto the floor...
The boss seems very upset about it. He says \nthey're acting like Menaces.
Think there's anything we could do to help?\nI'm sure it's easier said than done, but...
Yeah! I was hoping you'd say that!
The police... They need evidence before they\ncan do anything. Just like with my incident.
Sounds like they keep their backs to the\ncameras or stay in the blind spots.
Maybe if we see any suspicious behavior...\nwe could go for a pickoff? That should\nwork...
Oops, baseball speak. A pickoff is when the\npitcher and first baseman tag out a runner\nwho's trying to steal second!
Oh. But I guess there are no pitchers here\nbut the water kind, eh!?
Okay, let's get this beef bowl bonanza\nstarted! Fight on!
Oh, welcome! Please take a seat wherever\nyou like!
Psst, hey, {NAME1}-kun.
That customer over there. Does he look a bit\nsuspicious to you?
Do you think he's one of those troublemakers\nthe boss was talking about?
Let's keep an eye on them. Just in case.
Well, it looks like we're running low on\nwater. Maybe they're just trying to flag down\nsome staff?
I was a catcher after all. Gotta keep an eye\non the entire field.
No one's eager to steal a base if they think\nsomeone's watching them.
I'll go bring over a fresh pitcher of water.\nCould you keep watch, {NAME1}-kun?
Pardon me! More water to keep our fine\ncustomers hydrated!
Thank you! Have a nice day!
Yeah, that was sketchy with a capital S.\nThink he was up to something?
Ah! {NAME1}-kun! Over there! Crime in\nprogress!
I'll go tell the boss! And the police!
Hey! What's your problem, asshole!?
The police are on their way! There he is,\nBoss! That guy!
What!? I dunno nothin' about nothin'!\nLemme go!
You took a video of that, didn't you!? Heck,\nyou're still recordin'!
Don't let him delete it! Put the phone over\nthere and don't let him touch it!
The boss is thrilled! We caught the perp,\nand kept collateral damage to a minimum.
He said sales were good today too. Foot\ntraffic is up from the sound of it.
Which means a fat paycheck for us! Woohoo!
It's been a while since I got to put my\nfielding skills to good use. It felt pretty\nnice.
Ehehe, thanks!
You know! Surveying the field and all that!\nThwarting the stolen base attempt...?
Right? I slugged that pitcher like a pro!\nWait, you know that's not what pitching\nactually is though, right?
Anyway... I wouldn't have been able to do a\nthing if I were here by myself.
It'd be nice to work together again sometime.\nAh, I mean, if you want to, {NAME1}-kun.
Thanks for today!
Hi, {NAME1}-kun. Would you happen to be\nfree today?
I've got another part-time job in mind. Do\nyou think you could come with me maybe?
Really? Great! This job's at a convenience\nstore in Shibuya.
I hear there are lots of things to do, so\nit'll be busy... But I think we'll make it\nwork!
Ah, I see. Maybe I'll take it on another\ntime then.
I'd like to ship this golf bag. Oh, and I'd\nlike to pay my water bill.
Yes, sir! Let's see... That'll be 4,400 yen.
Thank you very much!
Phew... Finally, a bit of a lull.
This is even harder than they made it sound!\nThere's a ton to do, and a constant stream of\ncustomers.
If you weren't here, {NAME1}-kun, I'd just\nbe freaking out behind the register.
I think I'm getting the hang of this though.\nOne step at a time, right?
Let's keep it up through to the end of our\nshifts!
Tomoko-chan? Is that you?
Oh! Yeah, it's me. Hello!
This is my neighbor.
Who'd have thought we'd meet here of all\nplaces! I didn't know you had a part-time\njob.
It's a recent thing, I've got time to spare\nthese days. Oh, do you need a bag?
Yes, please. And yes... That must have been\npretty tough on you, huh?
I heard about your shoulder from your mother.\nSuch a shame. You were aiming for the pros\ntoo, weren't you?
Um... Yeah, well, you know...
It was that, what was he called, Subway\nSlammer? One of those "Menaces," right?
Some people said it was an accident, but\ngiven the circumstances, I have to think\nthat's what happened. You poor thing.
Whoops, sorry! Look at me gabbing away!
Have a good shift, Tomoko-chan! I'll be\ncheering you on!
Uh, yes. Thanks a lot.
Huh? Ah! Sorry, sorry! Welcome!
Oh, um. No, I'm fine... Ah, welcome!
W-Welcome!?
That'll be 181 yen! Do you need a bag?
No... I'll take it as-is.
H-Have a nice day.
I think I might've upset her...
Wait... Was that...?
No, not exactly.
Oh, yes, I'm fine. That interaction didn't\nbother me or anything.
Huh? Oh, uh... Sure. She was beautiful, no\ndoubt.
But I swear I've seen her somewhere before...
Ahhh, it finally ended...
You helped me so much today... Sorry for\nbeing such a burden.
I've always been bad with that sort of thing.\nI make one fielding error, and I just can't\nget back on track.
Motoha and I were battery mates since\nelementary school, and she was always\ncovering for me.
I've been doing my best to function on my own\never since she quit, but...
Before I know it, I'm right back where I\nstarted.
Thanks. I'll do my best!
You're right. I'll try to be a little easier\non myself.
Hehe! With you backing me up, I bet I'll be\nback on the horse in no time.
Right. Enough being a gloomy Gus!
We finished our shift no problem! And we've\ngot the pay to prove it!
Really, {NAME1}-kun, thanks so much for\ntoday. Let me know next time you're free,\nokay?
Oh, hey, {NAME1}-kun! How's your day\nlooking?
A shop I frequent is looking for some extra\nhelp, sooo, I was thinking that, uh, maybe\nwe could...
Have you been to the drugstore in Shibuya?\nThat's where we'll be working today!
Ah... It's okay. Uh, sorry to bother you.
Oh wow, this takes me back. I haven't been\nhere in forever.
I came here all the time during my baseball\ndays. Working here is a first though.
They sell a lot of good stuff here. Sports\ntape, cooling sprays, the works.
I used to stop by here all the time after\npractice. Even the staff knew me.
Hey, Tomoko-chan! Welcome, welcome!
Good to see you again! Oh, I guess I should\ncall you "Boss" starting today.
Ahaha, I suppose you're right. So, how's your\ninjury doing?
Oh, it's fine now! It doesn't even hurt\nanymore!
Good to hear. Lots of stuff to lift and move\naround at this job, so don't push yourself,\nokay?
Right, then! Let's do it to it!
Something I always used to think when I came\nto this store as a customer...
...was that they really ought to put all of\nthe foodstuffs closer to the entrance.
There are plenty of students like me that\nroll through here on their way home from\nschool.
They're all exhausted and hungry after club.\nI'm sure they'd want a cheap, easy snack to\nfill themselves up.
Look at me acting like I own the place...\nI can't just rearrange things however I like.
True. No harm in asking, right?
Fair point. There's a reason he put\neverything where it is now. I'd better give\nit a think.
Thanks for saying so. At the very least,\nI'd better ask for the manager's permission\nfirst.
Um... Do you happen to sell cooling spray?
Yes, you can find it in the aisle over\u2014
Oh, don't you work at the convenience store?\nHim too...
Oh, yeah! You came by the other day,\ndidn't you?
So, you work here as well.
Yes. Well, part-time, anyway.
Um... Have we met somewhere before?
What? We met at the store...
I mean yes, but before that, I could have\nsworn... Hmmm...
Oh! You're that figure skater!
Um, please don't say that so loudly... I'm\ntrying to keep a low profile...
Ah, sorry! I just got a little excited.
How nice of you to remember. Not many still\ndo so long after my injury.
I guess you don't follow sports news,\n{NAME1}-kun?
She's an amazing figure skater. Multiple\nworld championship winner amazing.
You bet! I've only seen her in videos, but\nplenty of people I know are fans too.
I have friends who've bought tickets to see\nher in person. Her routines are always\ngorgeous!
What!? You don't know who she is!? That's a\nworld-class figure skater standing in front\nof you!
She's won all sorts of competitions. And\nshe's on the news ALL the time.
Well, I haven't been doing much of anything\nsince I got injured before the last\ncompetition...
I was quite surprised when I heard about you.\nAnother bird with broken wings so close by.
It's difficult, isn't it? I'd want to get\nback to my sport as soon as possible, if only\nI could.
Yeah... You're not wrong about that.
Oh, but, I'm actually doing fine now. My\nrehab's been over for a while!
And I've got people cheering me on everyday\ntoo. Like {NAME1}-kun here!
Hehe, the pleasure is mine. You two must be\nquite close to work jobs together like this.
Ah, um, I guess we are!
Anyway! Has it been decided when you'll make\nyour big comeback?
Well... I'm sorry, I'm afraid it's still up\nin the air...
Oh, no, I'm sorry! It was insensitive of me\nto ask...
I managed to finish up my rehab, but it was a\nreally hard, painful process.
You're right, it's really quite...
Oh, but the rehab I went through must be\nnothing like what you have to do to get back\nin the rink, right?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to act like I know\nexactly what you're going through when I\ncouldn't possibly...
You wanted cooling spray, right!?
We have it in that aisle over there, kind of\ntucked away. Here, let me show you.
Tomoko Noge-san, right? And\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Thank you for all of your help. I appreciate\nit.
Please come again! This shop's got the best\nselection around.
Yes, I will. Do you two work here often?
Work often, yes. Here, not always... But we\nwork in a lot of shops around Shibuya\nStation.
But we work in a lot of shops around Shibuya\nStation.
I come around here quite a bit. Perhaps we'll\nmeet again.
Really!? Yes! I'd love that!
Wonderful. Well, until then.
Have a great day!
She knows our names now. That makes me kinda\nhappy.
Though when I asked her about rehab she\ndidn't have the best response, huh?
I just hope she's okay...
Yeah... I'm sure you're right.
You think? That's kind of you to say.
You two done stocking the shelves? We've got\na whole other box of inventory to put out.
Oh, yes! We can handle it!
Right, I just remembered! Let me talk to the\nmanager about rearranging the merchandise.
Hey, {NAME2}-kun. Do you know any place\nwhere I can study in peace?
I have a quiz on a subject I'm not good at\ntomorrow, but both the library and diner are\npacked today.
I was thinking that if I found somewhere\ngood, then maybe we could have a study\nsession together...
Huh!? Would that be okay?
Well, if you say so...
Oh... that's too bad. Thanks anyway. I'll try\nlooking elsewhere.
Don't mind me...
Sorry. My schedule was packed with shifts\nlast week, so I didn't get to study much...
...Um, {NAME2}-kun. I know I should've asked\nearlier, but... Me coming over on the fly\nlike this... did I inconvenience you?
Honestly, I didn't expect our conversation\nearlier to lead us straight here.
I didn't even get anything to thank your\nparents for having me over!
W-Well, I suppose I should at least introduce\nmyself to them... It's the least I could do\nfor barging into your home like this.
Come to think of it, I do recall hearing that\nyour parents are away...
Sorry, everything's just hitting me at\nonce...
But I'm happy we can study together in peace\nwithout having to worry about others.
All right, then. Let's get started, {NAME2}.
Ready to hit the books again, {NAME2}? Also,\nwanna hang out when we're done?
Hi there. Would you happen to have time\ntoday?
Of course, I totally get it if you have other\nplans...
Great, thanks a lot!
Ahh okay, no worries, then. Thanks anyway.
It's my grandma's birthday soon. I thought\nI'd put together a bouquet for her.
She's pretty spry for her age, though her\nhealth's taken a turn for the worse recently.
Grandma's always been there for me so this is\nmy way of saying thanks.
Still, I can't tell a daisy from a dandelion!\nI could really use some help here...
Great, thank you so much!
Yeah... I guess you're right. Well then, I'll\ngive it my best shot!
By the way, are you doing anything after\nthis?
Once we're done buying flowers, why don't we\ntake a look around the shops here?
I don't know about you, but I really enjoy\nthe vibe of underground malls.
There's something new around every corner,\nso you'll never get bored.
I've been coming here to check out the odd\noutlet or boutique lately.
I used to come here just for the sake of\nshopping. Now I'm all about enjoying the\natmosphere and interior decor too.
Maybe my new part-time job's given me an eye\nfor detail? Or retail, I guess you could say.
Are there any stores around here that you'd\nrecommend? If so, let me know!
And hey, if they have an opening, you should\napply! You'd be surprised at the things you\ndiscover in a job.
Talk about a city that never sleeps...
I have an errand to run at the bookstore,\nbut it feels weird coming to this part of\ntown alone.
Shinjuku has a ton of great shops, so I come\nhere a lot with someone or another.
That person would often be Motoha. We'd check\nout the bookstore, go see a movie...
She's been hard to get a hold of lately, so I\nfound myself putting off this errand.
So, um, you see... I'm glad you could come\nwith me.
Hee hee... Thanks all the same.
W-Well you're not wrong... There are a lot of\nweird shops around here...
At any rate, I'll be done soon. The bookstore\nis just up ahead.
This is the only place I know that sells\nminor league baseball magazines, you see.
So... Are you doing anything after this?
Since we're here now, it might be nice to see\na movie or something, don't you think?
I never come here on my own, so there's still\nlots of places I haven't been to.
Oh, and I bet there are places around here\nlooking for part-time staff.
Since starting my part-time job, I haven't\nreally decided what to do with my wage.
At first I thought about buying gifts for my\nfamily, or maybe my friends...
But when I stopped and thought about it,\nI haven't done anything to thank you,\nhave I?
The last thing I'd want is to get you a\npresent that you end up not liking though...
So I talked to Motoha about it, and the idea\nof taking you to Suidobashi came up!
I don't know if a place like this is your\nkind of thing, but at any rate, today's all\non me.
Rides, food, the sky's the limit! So, no\nholding back, okay?
Hey, I meant what I said. This was all my\nidea, after all! Go for it, I mean it.
That's right! Now then, what do you want to\ndo first?
Should we try a roller coaster? Or the Ferris\nwheel? I heard good things about the food!
This is also my first time here too, so I'm\npretty much down for anything.
Oh, and I want to get Motoha a souvenir. Let\nme know if you want me to get you anything,\n{NAME1}-kun.
Say, wanna do this again sometime? When our\nschedules line up, that is.
There's plenty of stuff we didn't get to try,\nso maybe we can save those for next time!
There's a baseball stadium near this park,\nyou know.
Motoha and I would come here a lot after\ngames when we were little.
When she brought it up today, I found myself\non a trip down memory lane.
Oh! Um... But of course, that's not the only\nreason I wanted to come here today!
A friend of mine works at one of the\nrefreshment stands around here...
I told them about my part-time jobs, and they\nasked if I could help out, too.
They only need me when things get super busy,\nso I figured I'd give it a shot.
This place reminds me of my baseball days,\nso I kind of want to process my feelings.
I thought that, um, maybe if I came with you,\nthen I could handle things a bit better.
I know, talk about selfish, right? Sorry to\ndrag you out here like this.
If you're sure... Thank you. It means a lot\nto me.
Hee hee, thanks. Really, though... Having you\nhere helps a lot.
Okay... I think I'm ready now. I'm doing\nthis.
Mind if I ping you on days I'm working here?\nMaybe I can treat you to something.
I'm a big fan of Inokashira Park, you know.
My grandma loves taking walks, so we came\nhere a lot when I was little.
The scenery is just so soothing throughout\nthe year\u2014the blossoms of spring, the foliage\nof fall, you name it.
Hmm? Oh, no, I don't have any particular\nplans in the park today.
I heard they're holding an information\nsession nearby for Tokyo volunteers, though.
I want to go, but I get nervous just thinking\nabout it...
Then I remembered how you helped me out with\nthose part-time jobs. Thanks to you, I was\nable to walk right in there!
Because of that, I didn't have to feel so\nanxious...
Oh, n-no, it's nothing all that grand...
Eh heh heh... Actually, I haven't put much\nthought into it, either.
I just want to experience more than just\npart-time work. That's all, really.
What about you, {NAME1}-kun? Are you\ninterested in volunteering?
Unlike part-time work, the only money you get\nis for your travel expenses.
Still, you get to do all sorts of cool stuff!\nHelping cats get adopted, things like that.
I'll let you know when I hear about anything\nthat sounds interesting, okay?
Whoa! Is this... for me?
I'm super happy right now! You know, I've\nwanted something like this for a while!
I can't believe I got a present from you!\nThanks so much! Ehehe...
This is for me?
I was just thinking I wanted something like\nthis. Thanks! I'm really happy.
What do you wanna do? I'll let you choose\nwhere we go.
Oh... That's fine. Maybe next time, yeah?
Hey, I was thinking the same! Let's go then!
I dunno...  I'd rather go somewhere else,\nif that's okay? Sorry.
I heard that store has some new stuff for\nsale. Want to go check it out?
Where should we go today? There's so many\nchoices, I just can't choose...
Hey, what do you want to ride today? I was\nthinking...
Coming to this park always helps me relax...\nThanks for coming along with me.
I love places with so much green around. It's\nso soothing.
Excuse me, miss. You can't take individual\ntomatoes out of there.
These here are sold individually. Those are\nsold by the pack.
Sorry! I misread the explanation! So then,\ncan I take from this? Wait, no...
Huh? Oh! Thank you so much!
Sometimes I have trouble reading Japanese...
Um, these are on clearance because the\nexpiration date is soon, right? But it's\nstill okay if I eat it today?
And this produce is on sale, but it's not any\ndifferent from the regular produce?
Does that mean the same produce outside the\nbargain box is discounted too? Or not?
...is discounted, too? Or not?
Phew! Thanks so much for explaining all that\nto me! You were a huge help!
Actually, do you have a bit more time to\nspare?
I'm an exchange student from Sichuan, China\nstudying at a Japanese college. I live around\nthis area.
Japan's still such a mystery to me. This sort\nof thing happens pretty much on the daily.
And you're, um...?
Ah, {NAME1}-san! Got it! You shop here\na lot?
Ohhh! Then today's my lucky day for sure!
Whoops, I just remembered! I gotta go buy\nsome tea...
Do you know any place around here that sells\ntea in bulk, {NAME1}-san?
The boxes I found here are baby-sized! I'm\nused to buying waaay bigger ones back home.
Yeah, I figured there were none around here.
I still don't know many people around here,\nand there's a lot of stuff I don't understand.
Like the other day, the light went out in my\nroom, so I had to call the landlord, and it\nbecame this whole thing.
I know fluorescent lightbulbs, but what the\nheck are "incandescent" ones? I've never even\nseen those at the store.
That's why, um... If it's all right with you,\nI have a bit of a favor to ask.
Please be my friend!
You mean it!? Thank you so much! I really\nappreciate it!
Awww... Pretty please, with sugar on top?\nI could really use a friend right now...
Of course! You just did me a huge solid back\nthere. You seem like a great guy!
Thank goodness! Pleased to meet you, friend!
Oh, but I guess there's nothing for you to\nget out of this, huh?
Relationships are about give and take, right?\nI can't be the only one benefiting!
I'll think up a way to thank you by the next\ntime we meet!
Now let's track down some tea, huh!?
Gonna find a shop\u266a that sells some tea!\u266a\nI can practically taste those leaves already!
Hey, {NAME1}-san! Have a second?
There's something I wanted to get your\nopinion on.
Hurray! Thank you! Let's walk and talk.
No worries! Let me know when you have time.
I've been having a bit of a problem lately.
Before coming to study abroad, Mama and Papa\nsaid to me...
"Go learn and experience other cultures."
Of all the countries, I figured Japan\nwouldn't be too difficult for me to wrap\nmy head around.
Still... Once I got into my exchange program,\nthe wind kinda fell outta my sails.
Since then I haven't felt very motivated\nabout my studies.
Hmmm... I was actually hoping you could help\nme figure that out.
Nope... No good at all.
I do, that's who! After all the money my\nfolks shelled out for this, I have to!
But... When I stop and think about it,\nthere's nothing I really want to do in Japan.
I mean, I like studying the language, and my\nlife here is far from boring, it's just...
I find myself thinking, "Why exactly did I\ncome here?"
It's kind of funny when you think about it.\nI'm the one who chose this.
Yeah. Really tough.
Ah, sorry... I might not seem that worried,\nbut it really is a problem.
You might be right, but if this keeps up I'll\nbe in real trouble!
If I had to guess, I'd say I was missing\nsomething from the start.
Once I chose Japan, Papa got serious about\nmaking sure I study hard and learn a lot. But\nthe thing is...
I don't think I ever thought about why it's\nimportant to study other cultures.
Now here I am all the way in Japan, but it\nfeels like a waste.
What would you do in my shoes?
You're so right, {NAME1}-san! I was thinking\nthe same thing.
Sorry to throw this at you out of the blue,\nbut it's important to me.
I never realized before, but having nothing\nto do is actually soul-crushing.
So, would you help me figure out what it is\nI want to do?
Oh, wait. Does this not mean "please"? Um,\nhang on, was there a more polite way to do\nthis?
I need to find my reason for being in this\ncountry. Please, please, PLEASE help me!
Thank you so much! You're my own personal\nZhuge Liang!
Trust me, I know how vague a request this\nis... But you're doing me a huge solid by\nhelping!
I'm sure you'll be able to help! Like, all\nthat stuff you taught me at the supermarket?\nSuper helpful!
Um, but if this is too much for you,\nI totally understand, {NAME1}-san...
Thank goodness. In that case, {NAME1}-san,\nI'm going to call you "Sensei" from now on!
Oh! And I've been thinking...
As thanks for helping me out, I'll give you\ntons of tools and recipes I know!
Hehe, gotta look out for each other, don't\nyou think!
Now you're officially my trusted advisor\nand buddy, Sensei!
Hehe, I'm counting on your guidance!
Man...
Here I was, stuck by myself with these\nthoughts swirling around my head about what\ncomes next.
But after talking to you, I'm starting to\nfeel excited about the future.
Thanks for the advice, Sensei!
Oh, hello there, Yaoling.
That's my dear neighbor, Yukimi Fujikawa.
Super courteous, that one. She may be younger\nthan me, but I respect the heck out of her.
Wait. Now that I think about it, you're\nyounger than me too aren't you, Sensei?
Agh! I gotta get my act together! I have to\nfind a purpose fast!
'Sup, {NAME1}-san! There's somewhere I wanna\ngo with you today.
Do you have time right now?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! So I want to\ngo to Jinbocho.
Ever since I was little, reading about other\ncountries helped me feel closer to them.
So, I figured that reading up on Japan...
...would make things feel a bit more familiar\nto me!
That's okay. Let me know when you're free.
Yaoling and I came to\nBook Town in Jinbocho.
Ooh! I heard about all the bookstores here,\nbut the stories don't do it justice!
I heard from my Japanese teacher that some of\nthe booksellers here are chummy with Chinese\nliterary masters.
Oh my gosh I'm so fricken excited! Come on,\nSensei! The browsing awaits!
Huh? This whole shop only has books by a\nsingle publisher!
How do they even stay in business?
Ah! That store is full of scripts from movies\nand TV shows!
Whoa... This place has WAY more than just\nsecondhand books. Amazing!
That store sells needles for vinyl record\nplayers...
Never thought I'd see a record outside of\nthose old-timey Hong Kong movies!
*pant* *pant* There's... so much... left to\nsee...
But I've got a serious case of jelly legs...
Yeah, you're right... I went a bit too hard\nout the gate.
Oh man. Realizing now I should've gone in\nwith more of a plan. Sorry...
Yeah, you're right. Slow and steady wins\nthe race.
Oh, you know I hear Jinbocho's famous for its\ncurry. Let's take a break for a bite!
Phew! That sure was tasty! I see why it's\nfamous.
Spicy food always perks me up.
I am from Sichuan after all!
Couldn't call this spicy where I come from.\nMore like mild I guess. Tasty, though.
But you'll never know what something's really\nlike without trying it for yourself.
With all these books here, I expected there'd\nbe more students.
Maybe the other kids are lacking purpose in\ntheir studies too.
You think so too? I guess it's no problem for\nsome people...
I'm right there with 'em. Searching for a\npurpose.
Well, if they've got something to be\npassionate about, that's amazing in its\nown right.
But why was Papa so eager for me to study\nabroad?
I never heard him talk about foreign\ncountries or anything before. Hmm...
Reasons... Like wanting me to experience life\noverseas somewhere? Japan or otherwise.
I guess he wants me to learn something from\nstudying abroad.
Thank you so so so much! Just hearing you say\nthat's enough to get me motivated again!
Papa never really explained his thought\nprocess, so it's hard to say...
But now I have my wonderful sensei to help me\nfigure it out, so I'll think on it real hard!
Oh! Let's go to yum cha at one of those shops\nover there!
I'm actually a bit of an expert when it comes\nto tea and dim sum.
Consider it thanks for hanging out with me\nall day, Sensei!
Hmmm... You can't go wrong with milk tea,\nbut I really think some Longjing would hit\nthe spot right now.
But maybe something sweet would be best to\nfill you up after all that browsing.
Hey, {NAME1}-san! I wanna go somewhere with\nyou today.
Do you have any plans after this?
Hurray! Thank you! All aboard for adventure,\nchoo choo!
I see... Well, gimme a holler next time\nyou're free then!
Yaoling and I came\nto Harajuku...
Oh boy, so this is Harajuku! Just look at all\nthe hustle and bustle!
Jinbocho was so old-school...
So I figured we'd go see where all the kids\nhang out this time!
Holy cow! All the people here are so trendy!
I thought you only saw them in Akihabara.\nHarajuku sure is somethin' else!
You don't say! This whole place reminds me of\nthe huge shopping malls in Chengdu.
Just like here, there're tons of people\ncelebrating the stuff they're into.
This place is just as packed! And there're\nclothing stores and accessory shops\neverywhere!
No wonder it's such a fashion hotspot! And\nit's not just luxury brands either.
You can find quirky shops with cheap items\nall over.
They're called thrift stores, right?
Yaaay, I got it right! So this place is about\nmore than just buying fashionable clothes...
It's about putting together a style all\nyour own!
Whaaat the\u2014? Look at the sweets those guys\ngot! Even the snacks here are funky!
Strawberry skewers, rainbow cotton candy...\nCHURROS!?
So much trendy stuff!
Still, if you're in Harajuku, it's gotta be\ncr\xeapes, right? I saw that on TV.
I'd prefer spicy over sweet though... Do you\nthink they make spicy cr\xeapes!?
I'm just kiddiiing! Well, mostly. I certainly\nwouldn't say no if they had it.
Ah! There's a cr\xeape place right there. I'll\ngo buy a couple.
This one's blueberry and sour cream. And this\none with the lettuce is...
Yeah! Check it out! The Killer Cayenne\nCrunch! Hehe, just messing with you.
This is a savory tomato-sauce cr\xeape.
I thought it looked yummy like a pizza.
Even my eye for spice couldn't suss out a\nproper hot cr\xeape.
Go on, take whichever one you like!
Seeing all these young people here today\nkinda boosted my spirits.
I mean, I know I'm also young, so maybe that\ndoesn't make a lot of sense, but...
All the kids here look like they're having so\nmuch fun.
They're totally focused on the things they\nlove, regardless of what people think.
They know exactly why they're here...\nUnlike me.
Yeah, for sure. I should find my own path\nwithout comparing myself to others.
I know you're right, but I'm way too restless\nfor that, heheh...
Oooh, Sensei, you sound like one of those\nwushu masters! Way cool!
Thanks for today, Sensei. Here's a little\nsomething for you.
All of the dishes in here are delicious. They\nget the Yaoling seal of approval!
All right, let's call it here for today. I'm\ngonna try to make a spicy cr\xeape at home!
See you again, Sensei!
Oh, hey, {NAME1}-kun. I could really use\nyour advice today...
Are you free?
Hurray! Thanks! Okay, let's get our walk and\ntalk on!
Aw, okay... Well, let me know when you're\naround.
Today, we're having a strategy session.
Jinbocho and Harajuku were so cool, and I\nlearned a whole bunch from them.
That got me thinking, the next place I want\nto go is\u2014
Oh, Fujikawa-san.
Oh, come on, I told you about her before.\nShe's my next-door neighbor!
Exactly! The girl right next door! We chatted\na bit outside the movie theater the other\nday.
Hehe, we've gotten a bit closer since then,\nyou kno\u2014
I don't care how you feel about it.
Just do as you're told. THAT is the\nproper way!
Yes, Mother.
Yuki...
Poor Yukimi-san... You think she's okay?
She looked so sad... I can't help but worry\nabout her.
She told me a bit about herself before. She said\nher father died when she was little...
And her mother worked herself to the bone,\nbuilding a company from the ground up.
She's raised Yukimi-san to be her successor.\nPretty harshly, from the sounds of it.
Still, that's no way for a mother to talk to\nher daughter! Not at all!
I hate to think what Yukimi-san must be\nfeeling...
I know she might seem a little stiff at first\nglance, but I've seen how kind she is.
You should see the tranquil look on her face\nwhen she pets the neighborhood dogs. She's\nsuch a sweet girl!
Exactly! I can't look the other way after\nseeing her get yelled at like that.
You're not wrong, but that kind of family\ndynamic clearly isn't normal...
I don't know all of the details either... But\nher mother says stuff that makes her cry.\nThat's not right.
I'm here now trying to figure out what my\nfuture's supposed to be.
But the idea of someone else deciding my\nentire future for me...
Someone who refuses to take anything I think\nor feel into consideration...
I don't think I could take it...
Wow! That's a great idea, Sensei! You've got\nthe answers for everything.
We'll do just that. The poor girl's at her\nwit's end, I can tell.
Next time we'll all hang out! You, me, and\nYukimi-san makes three!
Oh, and leave the location to me!
There's a place I wanted to ask you about\nanyway.
Thanks as always, oh wise and powerful\nSensei!
I hope you're looking forward to next time as\nmuch as I am!
Oh, Yukimi-san! I'm so glad you could make\nit today!
You remember {PLAYER_NAME}-san, right?\nHe's my sensei!
He's been teaching me all sorts of things\nabout life here in Japan.
The pleasure is all mine. Thank you for\nextending the invitation.
Ah yes, outside of the train station. You\nwere with Yaoling-san then as well.
I see... A master-disciple dynamic, was it?\nPleased to meet you.
And this is Yukimi-san, the nicest neighbor a\ngirl could ever ask for! Hehe.
Okay, let's get this train a rollin'! It's\na bit of a hike, but I promise it'll be\nworth it!
Behold! Asakusa! Just look at this crowd.\nIt's like a festival!
Check out all the sweet treats! Rice\ncrackers, dango, even baby castellas!
Oh, but if we're gonna try them all, we'll\nneed some tea too.
I don't know about baby castellas, but I\nthink Japanese tea would go best with the\nother snacks.
Hmhm, exactly right, Yaoling-san. I see\nyou've done your research on the area.
Wait, I was right? WOO! All right, let's take\na tea-filled tour of Nakamise Street for some\nyummy snackaroos!
Oh boy, this is the life! My tummy's filled\nto the brim!
You two invited me here today to lift my\nspirits, correct?
Pfff, whaaaat? Nooo...
You have my utmost thanks. Also...
Please accept my sincere apologies for my\ndisgraceful display the other day.
Please, don't apologize.
More importantly, are you okay? It sounded\nlike your mother said some really harsh\nthings to you.
It was my fault for not listening to her.
Not just anyone could manage raising a child\nand running a business all on her own.
Yes, Mother's way of speaking may seem\nharsh...
But she does so out of necessity because\nshe holds herself and others to a higher\nstandard.
I get where you're coming from, but you're\nher daughter.
Mother knows best. That's the way it's\nalways been.
My inability to comprehend that fully is just\nfurther proof of my inexperience and\nimmaturity.
Yes, he's right. Are you really happy being\ntreated this way, Fujikawa-san?
You plan on helping out with your mother's\nwork when you're done with school, right?
Isn't there anything else you want to do?\nWant to be?
What I want...
I want... to help people in trouble. I want\nto fight for them... as a lawyer.
But what does it matter what I want?\nEverything my mother does is for my sake.
It seems like everyone's headed home. Shall\nwe retire for today as well?
Thank you for your invitation. I had a\nwonderful time with you.
This may not be an adequate expression of my\ngratitude...
But please allow me to invite you both to\none of my favorite places in return for your\nkindness.
I believe it will help greatly with\nYaoling-san's efforts to learn more about\nJapan.
Ah, yes! For sure! We'd be happy to join you!
That's right! We do! Of course, we'd be happy\nto join you!
Uh, right! I'm sure it will be. Thanks for\nthe invite! We'd love to join you.
Wonderful. I'll be on my way home then.\nI look forward to the next time we meet.
Phew! Glad to see Yukimi-san's doing better\nthan I thought she'd be...
Still, I'm worrying about this stuff with her\nmother even more than before.
At the very least, we've made plans to meet\nagain. It seems like it'll take time, but all\nwe can do is keep talking to her.
Thanks a bunch for today, Sensei.
Since you made the effort to visit the temple\nwith me, here's this charm I bought!
See you!
Yo, {NAME1}-san! So I was thinking we'd\ninvite Fujikawa-san to hang out today.
Do you have some time?
Great! Let's meet up on the train platform!
That's a shame... Let's give it another shot\nwhen our schedules line up.
What sort of place are we going to today?
Hmmm... A place of respite, I suppose?\nI would be remiss if I ruined the surprise.
Here we are. This caf\xe9 was once a traditional\nJapanese house! This floor and transom are\nprime examples of Japanese architecture.
Whoa! So this is what they look like... The\nnatural woodgrain look is really soothing.
Pardon me.
Whoa, is this, like, REAL matcha? And the\nsweets look so fancy!
While not a proper tea house per se, the fare\nthey serve is more than adequate for the tea\nceremony.
Experiencing them in a carefree atmosphere\nsuch as this seemed a perfect opportunity for\nenriching your knowledge of Japan.
Yaaay! Thanks, Yukimi-san. Learning with tea\nand treats is the best!
Though they provide authentic earthenware,\nI believe we can forgo the usual formalities.
Hmhmhm! Every aspect, from tea temperature\nto the order the sweets are brought out, is\ncarefully choreographed.
All devised for the sake of the customer's\nenjoyment.
The tea ceremony is the very embodiment of\nJapan's culture of wholehearted hospitality.
Wow, Yukimi-san. You sure know a bunch about\ntea ceremonies.
Mother says such knowledge is essential for a\nbusiness manager to possess.
I studied flower arranging for the same\nreason.
Ahhh, I see.
Go on, Yaoling-san. Give the tea a try.
Hmmm. I see what you're saying about this\nplace.
At first, I was a bit hesitant about the\ntea's bitter aftertaste and the slight\nblandness of the sweets...
But the flavors complement each other\nperfectly!
This combination could've only come from a\nwhole bunch of trial and error, no doubt.
Not even a little. But I'm kinda glad you\nthink so.
Hey! Rude! I mean you're right\u2014but rude!
It's true, I know. Go on, now. Keep the\npraise coming!
I believe Yaoling appreciates the finer\npoints of tea quite well.
I am very glad I brought you here.
There is one thing I'm curious about. Ah,\nexcuse me!
Would you happen to have any yellow tea,\nor perhaps pu'er tea?
I bet they'd go really well with this sweet\nbean jelly.
Ah, I beg your pardon, miss. I'm afraid we\ndon't have any at this establishment.
Oh, really? That's too bad...
Ah, then maybe, would it be possible for my\nnext cup of tea to be a bit hotter?
My deepest apologies, but the experience we\noffer here is...
Yaoling-san. The tea ceremony is a\nconversation between the proprietor and\nthe customer.
The latter consumes what is provided,\nlearning of the unique flavor the former has\nworked to develop.
Proper etiquette dictates the customer\nstrive...
...to accept and appreciate what they've\nbeen given.
If you want to understand Japan, accepting\nthis principle is crucial.
Accepting... Hmmm...
Learning isn't about accepting what you're\ntold at face value.
I appreciate that this place put a lot of\nthought into how it serves everything.\nAnd everything was real tasty.
Still, I can't help but think of a few things\nhere and there I would personally do\ndifferently...
I just expressed my thoughts... Is that a\nbad thing?
Oh! Um...
Yukimi-san, you said before that your wants\ndon't matter because listening to your mother\nis the right thing to do.
But I don't think that's right. I saw the\npain in your face.
You have things you want to do. A purpose of\nyour own.
Yet here you are taking your mother's word\nas gospel.
Can you seriously just accept that!?
What does that have to do with anything!?\nYou know nothing about me or my life!
I apologize... I misspoke\u2014
No, I'm the one who should apologize.\nI didn't mean to get on your case like that...
Sorry about today, Sensei.
I just felt like I had to say something, and\nI had to say it there.
Accepting tenet is how that caf\xe9 does\nthings... I get that now.
Painfully so...
And of course I feel bad about calling\nYukimi-san out and troubling the staff,\nbut...
Even so, it just bothers me...
Why is it so important to behave exactly how\nsomeone else expects you to?
But maybe I'm being a hypocrite...
I mean, I came all the way to Japan to please\nmy parents.
Maybe I'm just projecting my problems onto\nYukimi-san.
Yeah? You think so too, don't you, Sensei?
I probably could've phrased things better\nthough.
I feel a bit better now. Well, that's all I\nwanted to say. Later, Sensei...
Howdy do, {NAME1}-san! Yukimi-san asked me\nwhich day would be good for us to hang out.
Does today work? Too sudden?
Great! She wants to meet in Asakusa. Let's\nhead on over!
Oh, all right. I'll just let her know. We'll\nfigure out a day that works for all of us.
I've been thinking about what to say to\nYukimi-san.
She's such a kind person. I know that better\nthan anybody.
Despite that, I went in guns blazing without\ntaking a second to think about her feelings,\nand made her really upset.
That's a great idea! I knew I could count on\nyou, Sensei.
Yeah, I have to do this properly. I'll need\nto make an opportunity to apologize and talk\nit out.
Yeah, I don't wanna just hit her with a\ndrive-by apology. We need to sit down and\nhash things out.
Yukimi-san is really earnest. I'm sure if I\nsit down and talk to her seriously she'll\nlisten, right?
I've decided to invite her to Chinese tea.\nThat's the least I can do, but...
I'm really worried.
Saying I'm sorry for what I said just for the\nsake of making up doesn't feel right.
Because I'm not sorry for what I said. I said\nit for her sake!
So what then? Make up superficially? Lie and\nsay I didn't mean what I said? That won't\nhelp Yukimi-san.
Hit her with the truth... Yeah... Hit 'er\nwith the truth!
Yeah... I have to be upfront and express\nmyself clearly. It's not just about getting\nforgiveness.
Well, when you put it that way, there's\nreally no other path forward, is there?
The whole point is to understand each other.\nCan't go avoiding the heart of it.
Thanks a million, Sensei!
Even when I'm at my lowest you're always\nthere supporting me.
Phew! I feel sooo much better. Thanks,\nSensei.
I think I'm gonna do a little shopping now.\nWanna come with?
I'd love to get your opinion.
Come on! Swashbuckling shopping and\ntea-sipping adventures await!
Oh boy... I can't believe we shopped all the\nway from Shin-Okubo to Shinjuku.
My feet are killing me, but I had a really\ngood time!
There's loads of long-standing Chinese food,\ntea, and sundry shops around here...
Great for times like this!
Now all that's left is to prepare for battle!
The whole point of this tea party is to sit\ndown with Yukimi-san, so I'm real motivated.
Exactly. I've gotta be ready to give it\nmy all.
Yeah! Thanks! Believe me, I'm just getting\nstarted.
Yukimi-san's just so put-together...
If I don't take this seriously, there's no\nway she'll hear me out.
That's why I've really steeled myself\nfor this.
But that's not the only reason.
I can't help but get excited when my favorite\nChinese tea is in the mix.
There's no way I can let myself lose on my\nhome turf.
Anyway, thanks so much for today, Sensei.
If I'd had to deal with this on my own,\nI would've stewed over it until I ended up\nspitting out some half-hearted apology.
Still, why do you always stick by me, Sensei?\nYou're always here when I need you...
You're so busy with school and all, but you\ntake the time to go shopping with me and\nstuff...
Sorry for asking such a weird question! Um,\nanyway! I'm looking forward to the tea party!
Huh? Special? Wait, so, that means...
If you use words like that, I... I might read\ninto it a little bit, you know...
Or... Are you saying what I think you're\nsaying?
O-Oh boy, this is sudden. Um... I've felt the\nsame for a while...
So, Sensei... Would you happen to have...\na little more time to spare?
Ah... Um, I'd like to talk about what\nhappened with Yukimi-san the other day.
Do you have time today?
Great. Let's walk and talk.
Oh, Sensei! I'm thinking today's the day to\ntalk to Yukimi-san.
Great! Let's head over right away! Today\nwe're headin' for Yokohama.
Oh, okay... In that case, let's pick a time\nwhen we're all free.
I am quite looking forward to trying your\nChinese tea recommendations, Yaoling-san.
I'd hope so! I've prepared only the best for\nyou, Yukimi-san. Ah, over here!
Today's a special menu I personally asked\nthe owner to prepare.
First we have this Chinese tea, aaand...
This Japanese sweet bean jelly to go with.
The tea is a faint yellow... with a unique\naroma.
Please, try it with this tea too. Let me pour\nit now so the flavor doesn't get too strong.
This deep indigo color... Or perhaps it is\nmore of a light crimson? Both are exquisite.
The first tea is huangcha. A yellow tea, rare\neven in China.
The second is a diluted pot of pu'er.\nA fermented tea you can find anywhere.
Softening the flavor helps it pair better\nwith the sweet bean jelly.
And lastly, we have lotus seed soup.\nA Chinese sweet made with powdered sugar\nand corn syrup...
Accompanied by Japanese sencha green tea.
I think you might find this dessert similar\nto simmered Japanese red beans.
I know you don't see lotus seeds used in\nJapanese sweets very often, but they're used\nas a paste in Chinese sweets regularly.
They're milder than beans, so they suit\nJapanese tea quite well.
The rich history of Chinese tea varies\ngreatly by region.
I tapped into a few of their distinctive\nflavor profiles to produce this meal.
Given the regional diversity, it's no\nsurprise that there're infinite ways of\npairing teas and sweets together.
That's what I think, at least.
You may be right, Yaoling-san. Every pairing\nyou gave me was delicious.
Even so, please remember what I explained to\nyou before regarding the tea ceremony.
The crux of it lies in creating a deep\nunderstanding between proprietor and\ncustomer.
Its established form and etiquette are all\nfor the sake of that purpose.
The customer is there to comprehend the\nintentions of the proprietor.
This may be difficult to understand from the\noutside, but that is how it is.
Neither party is meant to share ideas\ncontrary to what's been decided, no matter\nhow respectable they might be.
As such, this is not comparable to the\nculture of tea ceremony.
If you value everything by tea ceremony\nstandards, we'll never understand each\nother...
Yeah, you're right. No point in any of this\nif I back down now.
You know, Yukimi-san, there's something I've\ngotta ask after hearing you say that.
Do the beliefs you have about tea ceremony\nreflect your own personal feelings?
Or are they just something somebody told you\nwas proper?
People often talk about the millennia of\nhistory behind Chinese cuisine.
But you know, chilis didn't come to Sichuan\nuntil about 500 years ago.
If people back then had decided that chilis\nweren't a proper Sichuan seasoning, well...
Mapo tofu wouldn't exist anywhere in the\nworld.
Even if you want to hold the tea ceremony in\nhigh regard, that's an unshakable reality.
It's hard to say if something's actually\nvaluable unless you assess it for yourself.
Personally, I have no idea if other people's\n"right ideas" are right for me!
I mean, the only person who can decide what's\nright for me is me!
Ah, um... Sorry. I just can't stop talking,\nhuh?
It's just, I think you're the nicest person\nin the whole wide world, Yukimi-san...
And I know there's something you really want\nto do with your life. So...
So I just want you to live the way you\nwant to.
Yes, I see that.
Hmhmhm! Strange. My heart feels so warm and\nfull right now.
I've gained so much from our tea party today.
You have my thanks, Yaoling-san. When it\ncomes to tea service, your acumen is\nunquestionable.
Did I get through to her...?
If you think so, Sensei, then... I'm sure\nit'll be all right!
Yeah, fair enough. Here's hoping she heard\nwhat I had to say.
Yeah... For now, that's about all we can do.
At least I was able to get everything off\nmy chest.
Thank you for today, Sensei. It's hardly\nenough to express my gratitude, but here.
You know, it's thanks to chilis and Sichuan\npepper that we have mapo tofu and\nmouthwatering chicken.
I really admire the ingenuity of the people\nwho came up with that!
Oh boy! Not gonna lie, that was exhausting...
Follow me. I know another spot where we can\nrelax a bit.
You don't mind, right?
Sensei! Hey! Are you free today? I've got\nsomething important to talk to you about.
Hurray! Thanks! I wanted to update you about\nthe Yukimi-san sitch as soon as I could.
Oh, I see... Come back and hear me out when\nyou've got a minute.
So I talked to Yukimi-san after the tea\nparty, and she thanked me again for\neverything.
She really appreciated how concerned I was\nfor her.
And get this, she apologized for labeling me\nan aimless slacker.
Aimless slacker! How much ruder can you get!?
Still, she's gotten to the point where she\ncan tell me how she really feels straight up.
And she said I opened her eyes to a lot of\nstuff at the tea party. Hehehe!
Oh. And Yukimi-san plans on talking things\nout with her mother.
She really wants to become a lawyer\nafter all!
She wants to help people in need; the same\nway she wanted to help her mother way back\nwhen.
Such a nice sentiment, don't you think?
You know, I feel like I learned a lot from\nthis experience.
Coming to Japan to study doesn't mean I have\nto follow their way of doing things without\nquestion.
And I also can't go pushing my own beliefs\nonto other people.
Hearing, understanding, and respecting all\nthe different ways of thinking out there...
You have to strive for that or you'll never\nmove forward. That's what Yukimi-san\ntaught me.
That's how I want to live my life from\nnow on.
I have to face things, or actually, I WANT to\nface things head-on.
Maybe... that's what Papa wanted me to learn\nall this time.
Hearing or reading stuff secondhand isn't\nenough to understand something.
You have to go to other places, where your\nsense of common knowledge and way of thinking\ndoesn't totally translate.
Through experience, through anger and tears,\nhe wanted me to find my own answers.
You think so too, Sensei?
You're hardly the talkative type, but you say\nsmart things when you do talk.
Ahaha, maybe I made it sound a little\ndramatic, but I'm actually serious.
Right? I feel like the Monkey King when he\nfinally ascends to enlightenment!
I want to learn about Japan more than I ever\ndid before.
It took me awhile, but I think I finally see\nthe point of me studying here...
And it's all thanks to you, Sensei. You'll\nkeep helping me out from now on, right?
By the way, I'm not taking no for an answer.
All right, so first I need you to tell the\nlady at the supermarket to start selling tea\nin bulk already!
Just kidding. Japan has its own way of doing\nthings. I get that now.
By the way... You really know how to attend\nto an older woman, don't you? Hehe.
Oooh...! This is for me...!?
I'm so happy! I've actually wanted this for a\nlong time!
Seriously, thanks so much! A gift from\nSensei... It's like a dream!
Huh? Is this for me?
Thanks a lot! I'm really happy.
Hehe... Sensei, know any cool places we could\ngo? I'll leave it up to you!
Oh, that's too bad. Let's hang out some\nother time!
I've had my eye on that place for a while!\nGreat minds think alike, huh, Sensei?
Hmm... That's maybe not the best choice right\nnow. Any other ideas, Sensei?
Are you free today, Sensei?
I wanna learn more about Japan, so I'm out\nexploring today. Wanna come with?
Awesome! I'm looking forward to learning\na lot from you!
Too bad, but no worries. Let's go some other\ntime, okay?
So this is your neighborhood, huh.
It's so cool! It's got that "residential"\nvibe if you know what I mean.
Just look at all the winding side streets\ncrammed with niche shops! The big city can\nfeel suffocating sometimes.
Produce stores, restaurants... Ooh! And is\nthat a Japanese confectionery I see!?
Those mitarashi dango are making my mouth\nwater! Mind if we go buy some?
Thanks! Aww, you're always so kind to me!
I guess this is your backyard, after all. If\nyou insist then... okay!
Hah, you're quite the foodie, aren't you,\nSensei? No wonder we get along.
Whew! Here I thought I'd be checking out\nthe streets, but turns out it was mostly\nthe eats...
But hey, as long as we're having fun, right?\nThat's what matters.
I'd love if you could show me around\nZoshigaya again sometime, Sensei.
I'm always eager to learn more about your\nneck of the woods.
So this is your school, huh, Sensei? It's\nbeautiful.
Nice and close to the station, too. Although\nyou'd still have to dash if you forgot your\numbrella...
Shimo-Kitazawa... This place's oozing with\nculture! At least that's what my language\nteacher said.
Tons of places to eat, too. You won't be\nwanting for options on the way home!
That's me! Haven't you ever heard the phrase\n"food is culture"?
A quick treat after class is what puts the\n"high" in "high school life."
Oh, you know me so well. No snacks, no life.\nThat's my motto.
Now, I'd say this is the perfect chance for\nme to see one of your favorite haunts!
But as curious as I am to see what a day in\nthe life of Sensei looks like...
All this talk of food has got my stomach\ngrowling!
I'm in the mood for something sweet\u2014no wait,\na giant hamburger!
There must be plenty of great spots on the\nway to the station, right? Let's go, go, GO!
I've been curious about this place for a\nwhile...
It's even more amazing than I'd imagined on\nthe inside.
The worn corners of the altar and the\nsmoky stained glass tell a wonderful story\nof its past.
I'd love to take a closer look at the statues\nand equipment they use for Mass...
Honestly, though, it's all so solemn and\ndignified in here. Don't wanna get in\nthe way.
Better to just come and soak in this space\nfrom time to time. Doubt I'd ever tire of it.
Oh yeah, I heard that a pro shogi player\ncomes here to mull over her strategies...
You know that rumor, Sensei? Or better yet,\nhave you ever met her?
Even though people are constantly coming\nand going, it's pretty quiet here, so it's a\ngreat place to think.
If you ever run into her, tell me what she's\nlike! Inquiring minds want to know.
I see... It's totally possible I heard wrong.\nStill, it's a cool story, right?
A pro shogi player, practicing in a church\nto escape the hustle and bustle of the city.
I'll be back again soon for sure. And when I\ndo, you'll come with, won't you?
Ohhh! So these are the "monjayaki" I've heard\nso much about!
They're totally different from what you'd\nusually expect from Japanese cuisine...
They say it tastes like the kind of food they\nserve at stalls during street festivals.
Welp, let's get cooking! Lessee: first, saut\xe9\nthe dry ingredients, creating a... donut\nshape?
Then, add the remaining batter to the center\nof the donut, bring to a simmer, then mix it\nall together.
Aaand we're done. Oh boy, the smell of the\nsauce alone is making my mouth water.
Time to dig in! Mmm-mmh!, now that's a unique\nflavor!
The mochi and cheese make every bite taste\ndifferent from the last one.
It's like anything goes if it's tasty. Kinda\nscreams "Japan," if you ask me.
Monjayaki kinda captures that side of Japan,\ntoo. Don't you think, Sensei?
That was just my impression. Sounds pretty\ndeep when you think about it, right?
What makes a monjayaki gradually changes\nover time.
Ah! It'll burn if we keep chatting like this,\nSensei. Let's dig in!
Whoaaa! We're so high up! You can see the\nentire skyline of Tokyo from here!
I know it's a broadcasting tower, but it's\nabout as tall as the skyscrapers in Shanghai.
The area around here's cool, too. They\nplopped a modern marvel smack-dab in the\nold district.
You've got a river, greenery, and a range of\neateries... I could never get sick of\nexploring this place.
Once we're done soaking in the view, where\nwould you recommend we go next, Sensei?
Ooh, so you mean the rivers around here\naren't just for show?
Shinjuku and Shibuya are great, don't get me\nwrong, but old Tokyo's on the east side.
Along the riverside too, according to what\nI've read. I'm guessing we'll be able to\nsee it?
Ahh, I've heard of that place. They say you\ncan see a ton of penguins inside...
I wonder whether they get on well... How do\npenguins even view friendship anyway?
We still haven't checked out the shop below\neither. Could go look for some souvenirs...
There's no way we can see all of this in one\nday, that's for sure.
I think I'll be coming back here again soon.\nNo, you can count on it!
It's nice how you can see famous spots of\nTokyo you'd usually only see on maps, and\nunravel their history.
It's always so nice around here no matter\nwhen you come, huh? It's got such a relaxing\nvibe.
Yeah, I can really get a feel for Sensei's\neveryday high school life here!
It's so quiet, and you can feel the natural\nenergy and stuff... It's, like... majestic,\nI guess? Yeah, that's the word!
It's a dish with more of a history than I\nrealized... You could call it Tokyo's secret\nspecialty, huh?
Being up high is super exciting, right? I can\ntell you think so too!
Ah, Sensei. It's, uh... I know it's sudden,\nbut...
Today, I'd really like to see what your place\nis like!
Really? That's okay? Thank you so much! I was\nkinda nervous, but I'm glad I asked!
Ah, I get it. That's too bad. Maybe some\nother time. I'd really like to come over!
Hmm, I see, I see. So this is the kind of\nhouse Sensei lives in.
Considering you live alone, everything's\nsuper neat and orderly. I'd expect no less\nfrom Sensei, of course!
Ah, as for the state of my own room... I am \nnot taking any questions at this time,\ngot it?
After all, today we're just checking out\nSensei's room, and...
Having some tea!
Hehe. This is a super-fancy craft tea I\nbought. I hoped we could try it together,\nSensei!
...The flowers should be blooming now. Now,\nplease... partake? Enjoy? What do people\nusually say here?
I know, right? Whoever came up with this\nmust've been a genius, don't you think?
With all of the flowers floating around, you\ncan really enjoy this tea before you even\ntake the first sip.
Totally! I don't know all the details, but...
It seems they take the tea leaves, wrap them\naround the dried flowers, and tie them all by\nhand one by one... I think!
Here you go, Sensei, enjoy it while it's hot!
After we finish this one, we can try the\njasmine and peony flowers next. Well, enjoy!
Hehe. I brought something special for you to\ntry, Sensei.
Hey, {NAME2}... Sorry, I was chewin' on\nan idea...
Oh, but since you're here...
Totally out of the blue, I know, but are you\nhungry right now?
Perfect. There's something I wanna talk to\nyou about.
This isn't the place for it, though. Let's\nhead on over to Ogikubo.
Okay, no worries. Sorry to keep you.
I've been wantin' to try this ramen shop for\nforever now.
It's your classic Chinese-style ramen.
I dunno about you, but when I hear\n"old-fashioned ramen," this is what comes\nto mind.
Well, eat up. Your bowl's on me. Let's talk\nafter it comes.
Whew, well, that hit the spot.
The broth had that dashi taste with hints of\nseafood you can find in pretty much every\nJapanese dish...
...but the intentional, uneven thickness of\nthe noodles gave the dish a unique texture\nand brought it all together.
Oh, sorry. I just blurted out what I was\nthinkin'.
Oh, right. When I get lost in thought, I lose\ntrack of what's goin' on around me.
I wanna open a ramen shop in the future.\nA place that serves my ideal bowl of ramen.
But what flavors do I think are best? The\nmore I think about it, the more I don't\nknow...
If I remember right, {NAME2}, aren't your\nparents traveling now?
Does that mean you usually eat alone?
If it's okay with you, could you help me find\nmy ideal flavors ?
Whenever you've got time or your stomach's\ngettin' grumbly is fine. We'd just follow my\nnose...
Then I'd ask you a question or two. You just\nhave to tell me what you think.
Easy enough, right? And I'll even treat you\nfor your trouble!
Good question... I know it sounds strange for\nme to say it, but I'm a bit of a contrarian.
You're kind of the only one I can ask to do\nthis. Plus, I'm a bit of a contrarian.
I don't need nuanced responses. Just tell me\nif you think it's good or not.
I've been told by Pops a number of times\nI have to listen to other people's opinions\nmore.
But if I'm going to get the same opinion,\nI should get it from someone I can trust,\nright?
I thought at least you wouldn't be weird with\nme and have a flexible enough schedule.
I thought you'd have a flexible enough\nschedule.
Please? How about I broach it this way... You\ncook for yourself sometimes, right?
I'll even teach you some easy-to-make and\ntasty recipes. How's that sound?
I owe you big time!
Hey, I'm still on a high schooler's budget,\nso go easy on me, okay?
Yeah I am. No way am I lettin' you pay.
I need to recoup all the time I lost doin'\nthis on my own. I'm definitely gonna find my\nideal flavors.
Well, as promised, I'll teach you a recipe.\nBut we should leave now that we're done\neating.
Oh, {NAME2}! Perfect timing.
I'm off to try somethin' new. You comin'?
That settles it then.
It's a bit far, but I'm headin' to\nTsukishima. A place there caught my eye.\nLet's go.
I see... Well, maybe next time, then.
Man, it feels like forever since the last\ntime I came to a monjayaki place like this...
Nah, we're after ramen, remember?
Don't you worry. We'll be slurpin' down some\nnoodles.
You're a regular? Then did you know about the\nside menu here?
Sometimes you can find restaurants where the\nsides are as popular as their signature dish.
The ramen at this restaurant is excellent,\nor so I've heard.
That said... it doesn't feel right to come\nto a monjayaki restaurant and not order\nmonjayaki.
We're gonna be eatin' ramen after this, so I\ngot us an order of the simplest one to split.
I can go ahead and grill this bad boy up for\nus, if that's okay with you.
All right. Here goes nothing.
Sorry, {NAME2}. I got in the zone. You see\nthis crater-lookin' space in the middle?
That's where you pour the rest of the batter\nstill in the bowl. You can do the honors.
I've heard some people like to dump half in\nfirst, but let's just do my favorite: goin'\nall in.
All right. Shall we? I'm starving.
I'm getting a dashi base with a hint of tea\nleaves in the batter. This flavor...\nVery nice.
It gives the dashi a lighter taste that won't\noverpower any later add-ins like sauce or\nseaweed flakes.
This restaurant balances high-quality food\nwithout sacrificin' chances to bring in a bit\nmore money with extra toppings.
If I'm already blabberin' this much, the\nramen is probably gonna be out of this world.
Totally. I haven't forgotten. Let's move on\nto the main event.
I'm tempted, but we've gotta leave room for\nthe ramen.
Here it is... The miso butter corn ramen.
The regulars here refer to it as the secret\nsignature dish.
Let's dig in!
Unbelievable!
Oh, uh, sorry. It's just that this ramen is\noutrageously good!
They probably used the same dashi that was in\nthe monjayaki. The tea leaf flavor gives it\naway.
What's amazing is that it still retains its\nunique taste despite the strength of the\nmiso.
[Redacted]
It goes well with both the noodles and\ncorn. Versatile... A vague but accurate\ndescription.
The dashi is so perfect that it can both stay\nas it is or become anything else...
If a monjayaki restaurant is this good,\na shop specializing in ramen has big shoes\nto fill.
I felt the same when I tried the ramen in\nOgikubo, but I think character is key here.
Ramen with character... What would my unique\nspin on it would be...?
My obsession with the broth, huh...?
Stickin' to the basics, huh...?
I think Pops said somethin' similar. That I\ncan't slack off when it comes to even a basic\nramen broth.
A ramen with a focus on its dashi... Yeah,\nthat's exactly what I'm aimin' for.
Come to think of it, I can't do anythin'\nother than what Pops taught me.
I was so overwhelmed by the flavors of this\nplace that I almost missed that...
Thanks, {NAME2}.
Shoot, the monjayaki is burnin'! And the\nnoodles are gonna lose their bounce. Let's\nfinish eatin' quick!
Hey, {NAME2}. I'm off to try somethin' new.\nYou comin'?
Well, then, that's perfect.
But before we go... I wanna pick your brain\na bit.
Gotcha. Let's go another time.
You remember that monjayaki joint, right?\nIt made me think about runnin' a business.
I think the best time to eat ramen is when\nit's been freshly made...
I mean, who in their right mind wants to eat\ntakeout ramen? Am I right?
Good point. Maybe I'm just pickier than\nmost...
Oh yeah, you've got a point there.
Anyway, I decided to try out a takeout spot\nI've been scoping for a while now.
Smartphones are crazy, huh? You can just\nphone 'em up and grab your food when\nit's done.
Here it is. The soupless tantanmen that\neveryone's been buzzin' about.
It's a type of ramen called "mixed noodles."\nBasically, you mix the noodles yourself with\nthe sauce below them.
Well, let's eat. Oh, uh, you gotta really go\nto town when mixin' it, okay?
IT BUUURRRNNNSSS!
What the hell!? My tongue is on fire! Are you\nokay, man!?
I think I added too much chili paste. It did\nsay "to taste" on the packet...
Uh, {NAME2}. I'm kinda ashamed.
I'm ashamed of my short-sightedness.
To be honest, I didn't think this could hold\na candle to the monjayaki place. But I was\nwrong.
Uh, no, it has nothing to do with me addin'\ntoo much chili paste.
I underestimated what takeout could be.\nI thought it was just a worse version of\nrestaurant food.
But hey, just look at these noodles.
They're springy and made to be enjoyed cool.\nIt gives 'em this texture that won't quit\neven if they're not eaten immediately.
There are even reasons for the lack of soup:\nit prevents spillage during transport and\nkeeps the noodles from absorbing it.
But it's a shame. The texture would be better\nif the ingredients were cut larger...
No, wait. They've taken that into\nconsideration too!
Ah, sorry for yelling out of nowhere. But\nhey, look.
The ingredients are finer than the ones\nserved in restaurants, so it's easier to mix.
Customers pressed for time opt for takeout.\nThey don't have the time to sit down and eat\nin a relaxed place.
It's quick to mix and quick to eat. The\ningredients are small on purpose.
Takeout's delicious even when cold. It\nreminds me of the packed lunches my mom\nwould make...
Oh, hey, sorry about that. My mouth got away\nfrom me all of a sudden.
Now I just eat whatever I want, but I used\nto bring lunch from home back in middle\nschool.
My mom was a nurse and sometimes had to work\nthe graveyard shift.
But she still prepared my lunch for school\neach and every day.
That was absolutely delicious.
Well, {NAME2}. I think I was a bit na\xefve\nabout this.
I never really thought about it before, but\nyou can see the hard work people put into the\nfood you eat every day.
The more I'm tryin' to level up my palate\nwith you, the more I realize how amazin'\nfood is.
Yeah... I've realized that, as a chef,\nI still have a long way to go.
Hmph... I guess even being able to make that\nrealization shows I've grown a bit.
Heck no, I'm not about to give up now. I'll\ndo whatever it takes to become a chef of\nthat caliber!
It's like you said. This is no time to be\ngettin' so down.
And the same applies to you, too. I'm not the\nonly one on this journey anymore.
Do your lips feel a bit tingly? It must be...\nthe... Japanese pepper... kickin' in...
I need some tea... But before that...
That's perfect, then.
There's something at that spot in Ogikubo\nfrom before that's caught my eye.
Nice. They still have what I'm looking for.\nLet's go.
No worries... Well, next time then.
This place sometimes offers a special ramen\nfor a limited time only.
It's announced the day of, and they only make\nso many bowls, so it's hard to get.
They just happened to be doin' it today,\nso it looks like we're in luck.
And here it is. The curry ramen set meal.
It's a popular kind of ramen in Niigata. That\nmust be where they got the inspo for this.
Look, it comes with rice and pickled veggies\ntoo. What a great deal.
I mean, curry udon is a thing, so it's not as\nunusual as it is rare.
Me neither. I've never had it at a restaurant\nbefore.
Good point. It is a lot of food... You did\nsay you were hungry, though!
Plus it's gonna taste like curry, so I'm sure\nit won't disappoint. Let's dig in.
Oh, right! Don't slurp too fast or you'll get\ncovered in curry.
When it comes to what I imagined curry ramen\nto be...
...this is anythin' but!
They used the soup from the shoyu ramen we\nhad before to thin out the curry.
What do you think of the harmony of the broth\nand noodle thickness? They must make the roux\nfrom scratch!
Do you know how?
How to make a curry roux from scratch. Most\npeople use store-bought products, yeah?
Oh, sorry. When I get absorbed in something,\nI forget what's goin' on around me.
Oh, right. I was talkin' about curry roux,\nwasn't I?
Oh yeah? No problem then. If you're PSYCHIC.
But we're talkin' about how to make a curry\nroux here.
Making one takes lot of time and effort. You\ngotta fry the flour in butter slowly, so it\ndoesn't burn.
I bet this place prepares the regular menu at\nthe same time. When does the chef find time\nto sleep?
What a feast that was. Let's get outta here.
Oh... right. It's crazy to think that there's\neven more where that came from.
Put this in too. Noodles are good and all,\nbut with curry you gotta have rice as well.
Well, that hit the spot! Curry is way, way\nbetter with a side of rice.
I guess the chef knows that as well and\nthat's why they made it into a set meal.
Ahhh, I'm stuffed! What a satisfyin' meal\nthat was.
It tasted great and all, but they really made\nsure that you enjoy each and every bite.
That's customer consideration for you... You\nget so much outta a single bowl.
Consideration...
Ahh...
I remember once when I was a kid, I was\nhavin' ramen with my dad at home...
At the time, somethin' or other always had\nmy attention, so I didn't have much of an\nappetite.
Outta nowhere, my dad poured curry into my\nramen.
Bein' a child and all, I thought I had upset\nhim somehow.
I mean, he was never really a talkative guy,\nnor was he around much at home with his job\nas a truck driver...
But now I think maybe he'd had it in Niigata\nand thought I should try it.
Well, there's no way to know now, since\nhe's gone.
Like I said before, my parents are divorced\nand I now live with my mom.
I wanna open a ramen shop, but I also want to\nmake my mom's life easier...
Sorry. I know this has nothing to do with our\nsearch for my ideal flavors.
D-Does it? I mean, doesn't everybody care\nabout their mom?
Quit bein' all weird and pointin' it out like\nthat, man, haha.
Oh no!
Dang it, I got curry on my pants! My mom will\nhave my head if she sees it!
I see... So that boy is Shun Kano. He looks\nlike he has a promising future ahead of him.
Good to hear.
We're hittin' up a diner today. I heard they\njust started a collab menu with another\nbig-name restaurant.
They're doin' it at all locations, so we'll\ngo to the Shibuya branch since it's closest.
Oh, okay... Another time then.
Yep, yep. That's what it looks like. The\nshop's spicy tsukemen.
The red one's got chili peppers and fish\npowder in it. Fish powder is basically ground\nup dried fish.
Dissolve it as much as you want in the sauce\nand then dip the noodles in it before eating.
I've had this tsukemen at the main chain.\nIt's one of my personal favorites.
I wonder what led them to collaboratin' with\nthis diner chain... Time to find out.
What a great meal. I see now. That's what it\nwas all about...
I think they've taken a different approach\nwith the tsukemen from the one they've done\nbefore.
Sorry, I mean they've added unique touches\nthat you'd only find at a diner.
Oh, you finished yours too? Pretty tasty,\nyeah?
The noodles are thinner than at the main\nrestaurant and boiled to be a little softer.
They changed the fish powder mix and even\nlowered the spice to suit the family-friendly\nsetting.
They're tryin' to reach more customers\nwhile still maintaining their signature\nspicy-but-oh-so-good taste.
The order of operation has also been very\ncarefully thought out.
They've changed the production process\nso that even inexperienced line cooks\ncan make it.
Effort leads to labor costs, which are hard\nto avoid if you want to maintain the flavor.
But just because you've perfected somethin'\ndoesn't mean it can't still be just as good\nin another form.
Of course, that's easier said than done...
I can't believe that a single bowl could\nreveal so much...
You're truly one of a kind, aren't you,\nShun Kano-kun?
And you are?
I was just thinking of dropping by to chat\nwith you tomorrow. But it looks like fate had\nother plans, hm?
You're a food consultant!? For one of the\nbiggest companies out there!?
It's more than a big deal!
You have no idea!
Everyone in the food industry knows her\ncompany. They're the cream of the crop.
And she's a food consultant for them!
She develops recipes, plans events, and is,\nlike, one of the truest culinary\nprofessionals!
Such high praise. Why, thank you.
What interest would someone like you possibly\nhave in me?
We're in the process of planning a major\nramen-themed event called Ramen Promenade 2.
Kano-kun, how would you feel if I asked you\nto enter the competition with a ramen of\nyour own?
Ramen Promenade is a big ramen event\nfeaturin' famous ramen shops from all over.
What business would I have bein' there?
I saw the Food Fight video. You caught my eye\nwith how you were able to impress Miyazawa.
Well... News travels fast. Like news of how\nyou managed to whip up a bowl that left a\ncertain someone lost for words.
Naturally, in the event that you win the\ncompetition, you will be handsomely rewarded.
A reward, huh?
So? What do you think?
My mom...
What do you think, {NAME2}?
I... I'll...
Yeah. You're right. It's my decision to make.\nI'll...
It'll make things easier for my mom... It's\nalso a way to give myself more credibility as\na chef.
Hehe, that should make for an interesting\ncompetition this time around.
The event's theme is "ramen that will be\nforever loved by one and all."
Ramen that'll be loved by everyone, huh...?\nSo more traditional ramen then?
Not exactly. It's a world-class event, so a\ndegree of innovation will be required.
Please do contact me when you've decided on\nyour ramen... I'll be waiting.
It's kinda lame, but I was honestly really\nrattled by what Serizawa-san said earlier.
But I'll get paid if I win the competition,\nso I'll just have to swallow my doubts as\nbest I can.
It's all thanks to you givin' me the push I\nneeded.
Thanks, man.
I feel like I get the theme. I mean, what's\nnot to love about ramen? But how would I\nspice it up?
I still don't know what flavors I think are\nbest... I have so much work to do.
But let's not put the cart before the horse.\nHere ya go, as promised, {NAME2}.
Hey, {NAME2}. Wanna grab a bite? I'd like\nyou to try something.
I've finished a prototype to enter for the\ncompetition menu. I'd like to hear your\nthoughts on it.
I'll put on the finishin' touches, so just\nhang on one more sec.
This is it. I call it the ramenburger.
It's freshly made. I prepared it at home and\njust finished it in the home ec room.
I got permission to use the room first,\nof course.
Ramen's a pretty handy pick when you wanna\neat out, but you can't exactly eat it on the\ngo, can you?
But what if you could? Wouldn't that make\npeople happy?
Both ramen and hamburgers are restaurant\nstaples that fit that theme of "loved by one\nand all" to a T.
Then by combinin' the two, I can give ramen\nthat element of innovation they're lookin'\nfor.
I'm thinkin' of goin' with this, but what do\nyou think, {NAME2}?
I know. That's the most important thing.\nI don't think you can win with impact alone.
C'mon, have a little faith in me. The only\nthing weird about it is how it looks.
We've been tryin' tons of new foods, right?\nI based this on all of those times together.
I aimed for a dish that has a tasty broth\nbut also tastes good even when not\npipin' hot.
Agh, but this is takin' too long to explain.\nHurry up and give it a try.
Well? Feel free to be brutally honest with\nyour feedback.
You like the taste, but it just doesn't quite\nhit the spot, huh?
You like the idea, but it just doesn't quite\nhit the spot, huh?
Thanks for the honest feedback. I really\nappreciate it.
To tell you the truth, I kinda feel the same.
But I packed it with all the ingenuity\nI could muster. And I think the flavors\naren't too shabby.
What do you think is the biggest problem with\nit, {NAME2}?
It's possible that the visual impact could\novershadow the actual taste...
You mean what kind of people do I want to\neat it...? That's a good point.
As I said before, I feel like I get the theme\nmore or less.
My issue is innovation. What makes any one\nfood "innovative" anyway?
This was very helpful. I'm glad I asked for\nadvice sooner than later.
I'll try to improve it further by focusing on\nwhat you said, {NAME2}.
And then I'll present it to the world's most\nprestigious food consultant!
I'm definitely fired up to give this my all.
I mean, me even gettin' to enter the\ncompetition was a bit of a windfall in\nitself.
Now that that's outta the way, I am a man of\nmy word, so...
Hey, d'you still have time? Could you help me\nclean the home economics room?
When I got permission to use it, it was on\nthe condition that I would clean it after,\nbut like...
Hey, {NAME2}.
Perfect timing. I was thinkin' of meetin'\nwith Serizawa-san to talk about the\ncompetition...
But I wanted you to try my ramenburger 2.0\nfirst...
So {NAME2}, will you indulge me?
That's a relief. Thanks. Let's go meet her\nright away.
I see. I guess that's the way it goes. Maybe you\ncan help next time then...
I guess this means today is the official\nunveiling of Kano-kun's competition entry?
Well then, what do you have for me?
Should I plate it here?
Is the restaurant not open, or...?
Don't worry, this is nothing new. We do\ntastings of novel menu items here all the\ntime.
We've made sure that no customers will be\nallowed in until we are finished here.
I give you the ramenburger. A dish that\ncombines inspiration with likability.
It's gone through several revisions, but\nI think it's finally ready for you. Please,\ntry it and give me your honest opinion.
A ramen... burger...?
Hmm, I think I see where you're going with\nthis...
Let's have a bite then, shall we?
Well...?
It's delicious, and I'd definitely say that\nit gets an A+ for originality.
It's the perfect menu item to grab people's\nattention and get them interested.
That said, this isn't really what I was\nlooking for this time.
Maybe my explanation was inadequate.\nApologies if that was the case.
This year's theme is "ramen to be loved\nforever by one and all." In other words...
Ramen that has the potential to become a new\nstandard.
When I said "innovative," I didn't mean\nsomething strange and unconventional.
It's been botherin' me for a long time,\nwonderin' what you meant by "innovation."
Yeah, you did say that in your feedback,\ndidn't you?
Maybe I was swayed too much by the need to\nbe "innovative."
Perhaps. But it looks like you've figured\nit out...
I'm looking for something probably closer to\nwhat you're pursuing on a daily basis.
Don't lose sight of who YOU are and try to\nuse tricks just to grab people's attention.
Now... I'd like to ask your friend something.
You're the one who went to the ramen shop in\nOgikubo with Kano-kun, right?
Have you been going around with him to\ncheck out the flavors of foods at other\nrestaurants?
I see. It all makes sense now.
I had a hunch, but it appears that I was\nright after all.
Heh, that's cute. It all makes sense now.
I don't want you to take this the wrong\nway...
I'm not saying there isn't any value in this\nramenburger.
I can tell this is the culmination of your\nresearch together and that you put a ton of\nthought into the flavors and textures.
And I don't think the idea of eating ramen on\nthe go is bad at all.
But that doesn't mean you can overlook the\n"forever loved" part of the theme.
Kano-kun, you studied under Yamagoshi-san of\nHeritage Kitchen, right?
Don't you want to become the type of ramen\nchef who's always striving...
...striving to one-up himself with each bowl\nhe gives to a customer?
You've pegged me pretty well... But I\u2014
Instead of trying to snag a win with a wild\nidea, I'd rather you give us an entry that\nshows us what you've learned.
That's all I have to say for now.
Our doors are always open. Please do get in\ntouch if you'd like to give it another try.
Now then, I won't take anymore of your\ntime...
So to sum that all up... I failed completely.
I didn't understand anything about the\ncompetition theme or the food consultant.
It definitely wasn't my intention to come off\nlike I wasn't takin' this thing seriously.
But I'm not just gonna pack it in after that.
She made her offer after findin' out all\nabout me. There's no way I can back out now.
Next time, I'll definitely show her what I\ncan do!
She might've. I'm not the best at bein'\nintrospective after all.
I know I'm talkin' like I'm gonna do this on\nmy own, but I'll need your help with this.
So yeah, time for me to buckle down. Today\nmarks the start of another round of recipe\ntesting.
You'll be the first to get to taste the best\nones, so get your taste buds ready for a trip\nto Flavor Town.
But before I head off, I've gotta keep the\npromise I made to you.
Oh, it's you, {NAME2}.
I'm at a dead end with my recipe ideas for\nthe competition. Figured I could use a break.
Yeah, let's have some fun and go get some\nchow.
At times like this, familiar flavors are\nbest. But where would we go for that...?
Just what I had in mind.
And your house is in Zoshigaya too, so it's\nperfect.
'Kay. When you've got time, then.
I've been eatin' a lot of noodles lately,\nso I think I'll have somethin' other than\nramen.
I'll go for the fried rice. How about you?
There you go. Scuse me, two servings of\nfried rice, please.
What's not tasty at Heritage Kitchen, right?\nScuse me, two servings of fried rice, please.
Wh-Why not? I don't solely subsist on ramen,\ny'know!
Plus, we're doin' this for a change of pace,\nright? Scuse me, two servings of fried rice,\nplease.
Comin' right up!
Pops seems to be feelin' a lot better. He's\nin the kitchen about once a week now.
How's it hangin', chief? Can you get me an\norder of fried rice?
Hey, it's Shun-kun! I haven't seen you around\nmuch lately. All good?
Shige-san! Yeah, I'm doin' good. You seem\npretty well yourself.
Haha, age is still takin' a number on me,\nbut that won't stop me from comin' here all\nthe time.
I guess people really do love Heritage\nKitchen, huh?
Here ya go. Hope I didn't keep ya waitin'\ntoo long.
This is it. It's like every grain of rice has\nbeen cooked to perfection.
I love that Heritage Kitchen's fried rice\nalways has this great fluffiness to it.
Mmm, I can't get enough of how spongy the\nrice tastes. Chef, have you improved your\ncooking?
What the heck is he talkin' about?
Umm... Sorry, mind if I take a bite of that\nfried rice you got there?
I haven't used my spoon yet, so...
Huh!? Uh, I mean I guess you can have\none bite.
You weren't kiddin'! This really is moist...
I don't know, either. But maybe...
No, this is no mistake. But maybe, just\nmaybe...
No, there is only one type of fried rice on\nthe menu at Heritage Kitchen...
Oh, about that... I only really do it for\nregulars, but...
I observe how the person is feeling and\nadjust the seasoning accordingly.
Shige-san looked a little tired when he\ncame in.
So I put a bit more lard and salt in his\nfried rice, which is what gives it that\nmoisture.
What!? Really!? Your attention to detail is\nabsolutely amazing, Chef.
I hadn't the slightest idea.
By the way, you and your friend's servings\nhave less lard in them, Shun.
You were saying you've been eating a lot of\nnoodles and wanted a change of pace, right?
So I thought you'd like to eat something\nlight and dry with little liquid.
It's true. It's only a slight difference,\nbut it seems a bit fluffier than usual...
I can't stop eatin' it!
Just know that I only do this for familiar\nfaces, got it?
I don't want everyone thinkin' this place has\nsome nosy creep runnin' it.
So don't go tellin' folks about this, okay?
Pops, Shige-san, thanks a ton for today.\nHey... {NAME2}, I think I get it now.
I'm glad we came here today.
I wouldn't have made this discovery if you\ndidn't hang out with me today, {NAME2}.
The hint I needed for a taste that will be\nforever loved by one and all...
The theme! The hint I needed for a taste that\nwill be forever loved by one and all...
...was in the fried rice Pops made!
It was? I don't really get how, but I'm happy\nI could help you at least.
Yeah, I don't really eith\u2014noooo!!!
I shared my fried rice with Shun, so I wanted\nto get a bite of his as well...
But it looks like SOMEONE's already cleaned\nhis plate.
Ah... Sorry. It was just the right amount of\nfluffiness, so I kinda...
But I think {NAME2}'s still got some! Would\nyou mind givin' some to Shige-san?
My bad. Thanks for sharin' yours!
Even Pops is givin' it his all day in and day\nout. I need to do the same.
But first, I still need to honor that promise\nI made with you.
Oh, there you are, {NAME2}.
I'm thinking of meeting with Serizawa-san\ntoday. I've finished my new entry for the\ncompetition.
Wanna join me for her review of it?
Great! Let's get goin' then!
Gotcha. Oh well. Let's do it another\nday then.
I am very glad to see that you're still keen\non giving this another try.
I graciously accept your rematch.
I'm glad too. Please give me your true\nassessment; I'll take it in stride. Today I\ngive you an absolute classic.
Well... At first glance, it looks like a\nrun-of-the-mill shoyu ramen.
How promising. Let's have a taste then.
I can tell you used dashi in the soy sauce\nbroth. The taste somewhat reminds me of the\nramen from Victory Kitchen.
It's robust, yet evokes that mainstream shoyu\nramen flavor.
Yes, exactly. I don't believe I could've made\nan entry like this any other way.
It's very delicious. However, this alone is\u2014
Hold on a second.
Here's the second ramen.
What do you mean? Isn't this the same as the\none before?
No. Just give it a try and you'll understand.
Okay then. Here goes nothing.
The base flavor is the same as the previous\nramen... But this one is totally different in\nterms of richness!
I made both of these bowls with almost\nidentical ingredients and using the same\nmethod.
The difference lies in the lard and roasted\ngarlic I added at the end, and the saltiness\nof the broth...
This second bowl of ramen was created by\nmaking gradual adjustments in a bid for a\nvastly different finish.
So, Kano-kun... This means your entry for\ntoday is...
You guessed it. It's ramen that can be\nadjusted to suit the state of the person\neatin' it.
Yeah, our quest to develop my palate and\nPops's fried rice gave me the idea.
Yup, Pops's treatment of his customers\ninspired this ramen.
Oh... Sorry. I don't have any more to share\nwith you. But I'll make more, so bear with me\ntill then.
What people want to eat changes dependin' on\ntheir mood, their health, the weather, and a\nbunch of other stuff.
However, addin' seasonings to taste could\nresult in a less high-quality dish.
And there are limits to what a chef can do on\nintuition alone.
Even Pops said he can't do it for anyone\nother than regulars.
So I thought maybe some custom patterns would\ndo the trick.
Y'know, find some finishes beforehand that\nstill let a chef guarantee it'll taste good.
One for cold days, or one when a customer's\nsleepy... A variation for every occasion.
Here is a list of the different combinations.
By following the listed amounts and steps,\nthe same taste can be recreated at any store.
I see. So, in other words...
A base ramen and a list of adjustments.\nThis is the entry you're proposing, then,\nKano-kun?
...Magnificent.
In addition to a firm grasp of basic flavors,\nyou're able to creatively tailor dishes to\nfit individual customers...
I'd say you've achieved the theme of "ramen\nthat will be forever loved by one and all"\nwith flying colors.
This is definitely a worthy submission. I'm\nlooking forward to seeing how it fares in the\ncompetition.
Thanks... Gettin' Serizawa's approval means\nthe world to me!
Thanks, you know I won't. I'm gonna keep\ntweakin' this until the day of the comp.
O-Oh. Were you really that hungry?
Okay, okay. I came up with a combo for when\nyou're starvin', so I'll whip a bowl up for\nyou later.
I would also like to apologize for my earlier\nremarks about the ramenburger.
I only said those things because I wanted you\nto rise to the challenge as a chef of your\nown making.
Can I ask you something?
Why did you go out of your way to give so\nmuch advice to an exhibitor like myself?
You even knew that I had trained at Victory\nKitchen and was tryin' to develop my palate\nwith {NAME2}...
Yes, well... I suppose we can talk about this\nnow that I have finished reviewing your\nentry.
I think it was due to the professional\napproach you take to food.
Truth be told, my father was also a chef.
He was a clumsy and blunt man who always\nstruggled to communicate with even me, his\nown daughter.
But more than anything, he loved to see his\ncustomers enjoy his food.
And I was proud of him for that.
I'm also in the restaurant business now, but\nI handle far more money each day than my\nfather's store ever did.
And yet, a thought sometimes crosses my mind:
Can my work bring smiles to customers' faces\nlike my father's did?
When I see that professional side of you,\nI'm reminded of my father.
Maybe that's why I decided to support you.
But I digress... Once again, congratulations,\nShun Kano-kun.
The Ramen Promenade 2 Executive Committee\nwelcomes your participation.
I did it, {NAME2}! Still can't believe it...
After all that work, my ramen's gonna be\nfeatured in Ramen Promenade 2!?
I can't thank you enough. This is what all of\nour hangin' out has led to.
Oh, I've been waitin' for you, {NAME2}.
Are you hungry right now? I've got somethin'\nI want you to try.
Okay, hold on a sec then. I'll have it ready\nin no time.
Oh, okay. I'd still like you to try it some\ntime when you're free.
Sorry to keep you waitin'. I just made this\nin the home ec room. Give it a try.
This ramen recipe is still in development,\nso it's pretty simple without any toppings\nor special seasoning...
But I made it with you in mind. It's for you\nand you only to eat.
This is to make it up to you for that\nother day...
The one where you tagged along with me but I\ndidn't prepare you a bowl too.
Well, it's not just for that. It's also to\nthank you for helping me on that long journey\nto find my ideal flavors.
According to Serizawa-san, the ramen I\nentered into the competition was well\nreceived.
I'm so relieved that I didn't end up\ndisappointin' her.
That said, its flavor was heavily inspired by\nthe ramen at Heritage Kitchen.
Next time, I want to be evaluated on the\ntaste of somethin' I created from scratch.
So this is the first step in that journey.
While we were developing my palate, I also\ngot a rough sense for your preferences.
Yep, even though it's still a work in\nprogress, I'm confident in it.
Well, you'll find out after you have a taste.
N-No! The main point was to find my ideal\nflavors. It just so happened I also learned\nwhat you liked...
Anyway... Try it first. And then let me know\nwhat you think.
So... How was it?
Right? You like a good aftertaste, don't you?\nI got that feelin' when I was eatin'\nwith you.
Such high praise. Thanks for being so frank\nwith your feedback.
You didn't even realize you finished eatin'?\nWhat better compliment is there than that?
Did you notice at all that I used two\ndifferent types of soy sauce for the base?
I see... I'll take that into consideration.
I still lack both knowledge and experience.\nI need to keep developing my palate.
If you don't mind, I hope you'll keep lending\nan ear, {NAME2}.
I thought you'd say that.
Totally. I need to broaden my horizons, or\nI'll never find the flavors I'm aimin' for.
This experience really opened my eyes in that\nregard.
Haha, sure thing. Nobody out there's a match\nfor you, {NAME2}.
Thanks in advance for helpin' out.
I have an idea for the next place already,\nbut first I have to fulfill my promise.
Th-This is...!
Are you really sure I can have this!? I've\nwanted it so bad!
Thank you. I owe you one!
Huh!? Are you sure...?
I appreciate it. You didn't have to go out of\nyour way.
Hey, {NAME2}. You hungry?
I'm off to try somethin' new to develop my\npalate. Wanna tag along?
Cool. Let's get going then.
'Kay. Maybe some other time.
Oh, they've got somethin' new. I think I'll\ntry it.
What should I get then? My stomach wants that\ntoday, but my mind wants to try this...
Have any new restaurants opened up? Maybe we\nshould see what's in the area.
There are so many shops I haven't been to yet\nhere. Where should we go today?
If food is art... then I feel like having a\nbetter understanding of art might help me\ndevelop my palette...
Here it is. The new convenience store-limited\nsoba bento!
They got some big restaurant making these.\nMakes you wonder if it's any good.
Are they actually tryin' to make it taste as\ngood as the fresh stuff?
Or did they prioritize convenience over\nflavor?
What do you think?
Yeah, I agree. Being able to enjoy\nrestaurant-level quality from a convenience\nstore sounds nice.
Yeah, you're right. It's less than half the\nprice you pay at the restaurant.
Can't ask for much more than that.
Right, I'm off to the counter. You want yours\nwarmed up?
Huh? They come in different flavors. It's\neither pork or miso for the base.
Cool, might as well try both. Let's have half\neach and trade.
Glad you're here. These are pretty filling.\nDon't think I could finish 'em both on\nmy own.
I helped Shun research food at\nthe convenience store. I got a\nbento by a classic restaurant.
I helped Shun research food at\nthe convenience store. I got a\npasta dish by a famous chef.
I helped Shun research food at\nthe convenience store. I got a\npopular patisserie's dessert.
I helped Shun research food at\nthe convenience store. I got\nsome snacks from my childhood.
I helped Shun research food at\nthe convenience store. I got\nfried snacks from the counter.
By the way, what do you usually have for\nlunch?
Your parents aren't around to make lunch for\nyou, right?
Right. The bread they sell there is great.\nI'll never get sick of it.
No wonder the students love it so much. Been\nthat way for years.
I get that. Gotta switch it up every now\nand then.
I'm like that too. I let my mood decide what\nto eat.
You don't? Really? How do you survive the\nafternoon classes?
You sure you're holding up? Seriously, eat\nsomething.
Right, let's check out the school store.\nAfter all, sometimes the best stuff is right\nunder your nose.
Go ahead. Choose whatever.
You don't mind? Truth is, things have been\nkinda tight for me this month.
Well actually... things are kinda tight right\nnow. Think we could split today?
I owe you one. I'll treat you next time we\nhang out. That's a promise.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. We nabbed stuff\nthat's usually out of stock.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. We were hungry and\nended up buying way too much.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. We observed what\nwas popular before buying.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. He gave me the\nrundown on the new stock.
I checked out the school store\nwith Shun. I decided to treat\nhim today.
You might know Harajuku for the fashion, but\nthey also have great restaurants here.
The customers are sensitive to trends though,\nso the turnover rate's sky high.
What do you normally check out when\nyou're here?
Sounds about right. This is the fashion\ndistrict, after all.
That said, I really don't know much about\nwhat's hot and what's not...
When I was training to make ramen, I just\nwent from my school uniform to my chef's\nclothing and that was that.
Maybe you could give me some fashion advice\nsome time, if it's not too much trouble.
So that's what you're into... Uh, didn't mean\nthat in a weird way.
You just don't carry that stuff with you,\nso I didn't expect it.
Can't say I know much about that. Tell me\nabout it some time.
Well, I think I'll hit a restaurant and see\nwhat they're offering.
There's a new ramen shop that I'm curious\nabout.
I've seen pictures of their food online. The\ntoppings were a little unusual.
I'm getting all of them. You'd better think\nover what you're gonna order too.
I hung with Shun in Harajuku.\nWe joined a line of customers\nsnaked around a cr\xeape shop.
I hung with Shun in Harajuku.\nHe asked for my verdict on the\nramen we had together.
I went with Shun to Harajuku.\nWe looked at clothes before\nheading to a restaurant.
I hung with Shun in Harajuku.\nWe had a fun time\neating on the go.
I hung with Shun in Harajuku.\nToday, I decided to treat him.
The atmosphere here's real nice.
Shops from a hundred years ago lined up right\nnext to brand new ones.
It's chaotic in a good way. Sort of like a\nblend of the old and new.
So, anything you want to eat?
Oh, nice. I was thinkin' the same.
I can smell freshly baked rice crackers in\nthe air.
Y'know, they cook those out front and cool\n'em with a fan, all the while hollerin' to\nlure in customers the old-fashioned way.
I'm sure I'll learn something new. Let's\nhead over.
Social media-worthy, huh? I've never given\nthat sorta stuff much thought.
But I suppose there are some ramen shops that\nare all about making their food look flashy.
Who knows? Maybe I'll learn somethin' new.\nLet's look for that.
We can think over what to check out next\nwhile we eat.
Didn't expect to see so many shops here. It'd\nbe a waste to not see what they're about.
Huh. Is that a line formin' over there?
I like the way they're callin' out to\ncustomers. Let's check it out later.
Shun and I visited Sensoji.\nWe strolled while enjoying\ntraditional snacks.
Shun and I visited Sensoji.\nWe tried trendy treats while\nmeandering the streets.
Shun and I visited Sensoji.\nA friendly shop owner offered\nus free samples.
Shun and I visited Sensoji.\nWe munched on fresh\nmeat cutlets and croquettes...
Shun and I visited Sensoji.\nWe snacked on street food\nand washed off at a bathhouse.
A while back, I had a customer who was a food\nresearcher.
While they were eatin', they told me that\nfood is an art form.
But, like, art is the stuff you see hangin'\nin museums, right?
Saying cooking is just like that doesn't make\nmuch sense to me.
Though I s'pose I see how artists and chefs\ncould be similar in some ways.
I wonder if studyin' art will help my\ncooking.
You think so too? Creating something takes\na lot of effort.
It takes heaps of trial and error till you\nend up with somethin' you approve of.
I guess, yeah, art is like food. You can tell\nwhat the creator struggled with.
Y-Yeah, that's what I said... Well, that\ncustomer said it first.
Maybe it is better to think of them as one\nand the same.
Studyin' someone else's cooking is the same\nas studyin' someone else's art.
In other words, I can learn how to cook\nbetter by lookin' at the art on display here.
Right? Man, I dunno. At least with food,\nyou'll know when you try it.
With art, I don't know enough of the basics\nto be able to tell.
Hey, so I've got a serious favor to\nask you...
Can I use your place to whip up some\ndesserts?
The kitchen at my place just isn't set up for\nthat sorta thing.
You mean it!? Thanks, man! You're a total\ngodsend!
Oh, hold up. I gotta get ingredients first.\nDo you live near a supermarket?
Oh, my bad. No, it doesn't have to be now.\nWhenever works for you.
...Thanks again man.
Whoa! This place ain't too shabby at all.
Pops always used to say that you can tell\na lot about someone by their kitchen.
I think he was onto somethin'. This kitchen's\ntotally your vibe, {NAME2}.
I bet I could cook up all kinds of new stuff\nin a place as nice as this.
Oh yeah? I'm sure you can't!
Hmm, that's a good question. It's kinda hard\nto put into words...
Ever since the Ramen Promenade 2 incident,\nI've been feelin' like I haven't been taking\nmy cookin' seriously enough.
So, I want to try makin' somethin' totally\nout of my wheelhouse.
I feel like it'd do me some good to shake\nthings up from time to time. Y'know, cook\nsomethin' unrelated to ramen.
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't hopin' to\ndevelop my palette more, like when we're\nhangin' out...
But that's different. I mainly wanna use this\nas a chance to unwind a little bit.
Anyway, as thanks for lettin' me use your\nkitchen, I'm gonna whip up some wicked treats\nso get ready for a taste explosion!
Oh, don't be shy if you have any requests.\nI'll keep 'em in mind for next time.
Okay, then! Time to try and expand my\nculinary repertoire!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan...
Hold on... Are you offering to lend me\nan ear!?
All right... See you later...
In that case, to get straight to it...
I was just wondering how to understand\nteenager's feelings and\u2014 Oh!
That's it! Why don't you teach me,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Oh, I'm sorry. You must think I'm totally\nbuggin', asking you that out of nowhere.
To explain, my nephew is going to be staying\nwith us for a while.
He just graduated high school, which means\nyou two are around the same age.
Apparently he has a dream of becoming... some\nkind of special actor?
He wants to come to Tokyo and work part-time\nwhile going to acting school.
I know, right?
Someone who leaves home to pursue a\ndream in this day and age... I really want to\nsupport him.
But, I don't know, I just feel like the\ngeneration gap is wider than ever these days.
Maybe it makes me majorly clueless, but I'm\nthe type of person who doesn't know when to\nshut up.
What do you think, {NAME2}-chan? Am I a\ntotal space cadet?
Oh, dear! You're a sweet kid, but you still\nneed to learn what a girl wants to hear.
Yeah, I thought so... But I do recognize that\nin myself, you know.
Wait, you don't know what that means?\nIt's someone who's totally out of touch with\nwhat's going on around them.
Basically, someone who can't read the room.\nHuh... So kids today don't know that one?
Anyway, that's the situation.
How am I supposed to support him if I'm just\nstressing him out all the time?
He's family. I don't want to do anything to\ntrouble my hubby.
I'll be counting on your help!
What, {NAME2}-chan? You're the one who\noffered to hear me out!
Which means you're going to tell me all about\nhow teens today feel.
Oh, {NAME2}-chan! You've grown up to be such\na reliable young man.
Of course, there's something in it for\nyou too.
Did your mom ever tell you that I used to be\na stylist before I got married?
I guess showing you would be quicker. Hold on\njust a sec.
Here. For you.
Clothes! They're wicked cool!
I just said I was a stylist. They're clothes,\nno duh.
My hubby works in the clothing industry, so\nhe brings samples home for me all the time.
This is an outfit I coordinated from head\nto toe!
Try it on!
Yup! We've got to see how it looks on you!\nYour home's nearby, isn't it?
Based on your shoulder width, I think the\nsize should be right.
Run along. I'll be waiting here.
Oh, that's nice. It fits you perfectly too.
Can you give me a little spin?
Totally tubular!
Well, things are about to get a lot busier\nfor me! I've got to be a good wife, a good\nauntie...
A good stylist too. Just how many hats does a\ngirl gotta wear!?
Talking to a kid in a school uniform makes me\nfeel like I'm back in school too.
Speaking of, here's a shot of me back when I\nwas young. And there's my hubby, of course!
This is Gal style\u2014short skirts and loose\nsocks! Hubby and I were unstoppable\nback then!
Looking forward to picking your brain even\nmore from now on!
Oh dear! I almost forgot, my hubby's coming\nhome early today.
I've got to get dinner ready. See you later!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. How are you?
Your timing couldn't be more perfect.\nRemember how you were going to teach me all\nabout how teens feel?
I actually have something I need to ask you\nabout. Do you have a minute?
Really? Great! Okay, I'll make this short.
Really? Well, let me know when you have the\ntime, okay?
So about my hubby's nephew... You know,\nthe one who wants to be an actor.
Now that we've agreed to take him in, we've\nbeen messaging back and forth, but um...
Do you know what a multimedia message is,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Yeah, of course you do! Everyone does! Right?
Oh... Well yeah, I guess texting photos\nthese days isn't any different from texting\nmessages.
It was like a text message, but for sending\nphotographs you took on your phone.
You at least know what a text message is,\nright...?
Anyway, my nephew's new to the area, so I\nthought I'd go pick him up from the station.
I figured it'd be better to know what he\nlooks like, so I asked him to send me a pic\nvia MMS...
But I never expected him to have no idea what\nI was talking about!
I guess I really do live in a different world\nthan teens these days.
Oh? Hehe, how poetic.
You're right. If I get down on myself over\nsomething like this, then what has my life\nbeen all about!?
That sounds like something out of a comic\nbook. Did you know that when you said it?
You're right. If I get down on myself over \nsomething like this, then what has my life\nbeen all about!?
Um, ten, twenty... Wait, what're you trying\nto make me admit to!?
So yeah, there's a huge age gap! Is that a bad\nthing?
Still, if I get down on myself over something\nlike this, then what has my life been all\nabout!?
Back when I was in high school, just planning\nto meet someone took so much effort.
My hubby didn't have a beeper or a cellphone,\nso I had to call his house number.
But that meant anyone could pick up. It was\nsooo awkward when his mom answered!
But I powered through it because I wanted\nto see him. If I could just recapture that\nfeeling, I'd be invincible!
Thanks for hearing me out, {NAME2}-chan.\nNow I'm raring to go!
Oh, right. A token of my thanks. Hold on just\na second.
Here you go. Try it on.
And spin.
Oh no! I have to go and iron hubby's shirts.
He said he has a really important meeting\ntomorrow. See you later!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. I've been seeing a lot of\nyou lately.
And what perfect timing. I need some help\nfrom my teenage consultant.
There's something I wanted to ask you about.\nDo you have some time to spare?
Really? Great! I'll make it quick then. Well,\nquick by my standards.
Really? Well, let me know when you have\ntime, okay?
So out of curiosity... How much cash do you\nhave on you?
Right? I always keep cash on me just in case.
Oh, I guess so. That is a weird thing to ask\nsomeone out of nowhere, isn't it?
No, no. Do I really seem like an\nex-delinquent!?
It's about the nephew I mentioned before.\nHe started living with us recently.
And well, I guess it's a habit as an\nex-stylist, but I'm always looking at what\nhe's wearing.
Then I realized, I've never seen him with a\nwallet. So, I asked if he was carrying any\ncash on him.
Then he said something about being\n"cashless"? And paying with a "smart wallet"?
I thought forgetting your wallet at home was\nsomething everyone experienced.
But I guess teens these days don't know that\nfeeling either, huh?
Really? I guess you see things more like\nI do.
Yeah, I guess not anymore...
Oh, so you're one of them?
I'd kind of like to see how you'd react to\nthat situation one day.
I guess our approach to money, or just life\nin general, is fundamentally different now...
A few years into our relationship, my hubby\ntook me to a really nice teppanyaki place.
I guess it would've been right around the\ntime when we were graduating.
There was foie gras, there was lobster, and\nthere was a whole hibachi performance!
Then while I was heading to the bathroom,\nmy hubby went to go pay for everything.
I saw him counting the bills in his wallet,\nwith a worried look on his face.
Seeing him then... I don't know, it was like\nthe emotions were almost too much to handle.
Stop it already, {NAME2}-chan! You're way\ntoo good at getting stories out of me!
Still, the inconvenience is what creates\nmemories I guess. But now we can't share\nthat anymore...
Sorry, what were we even talking about again?
Oh, right. That's why I came to you in the\nfirst place.
Yeah, that's it! About my nephew not carrying\na wallet.
You want to hear more about our date? As if!\nI'll just leave it to your imagination!
Hehe, I'm all over the place today. I'm not\neven sure what it is I wanted to ask...
But time just seems to fly by when I'm\ntalking with you, {NAME2}-chan.
I do think I figured one thing out though.
I want my nephew to enjoy himself while he's\nstaying with us.
So you know what that means! I'll be coming\nback for more advice another time!
Oh no! I forgot I left my hubby's pillowcase\nout to dry!
See you, {NAME2}-chan!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. So, how've you been?
I'm glad you're here. I need you to teach me\nmore about modern teens.
There's something I wanted to ask you about.\nIs now a good time?
Really? Great! Okay, I'll make this short.\nShort for me at least.
Really? Well, let me know when you have a\nspare moment, okay?
You know how they say that arguing with\nsomeone is proof that you're close?
Like, me and my hubby are as lovey-dovey as\nit gets, but we always fight over the AC.
My nephew who came to live with us is pretty\ncandid in telling us what he wants.
But we haven't fought a single time! Even\nthough he's been with us for a while!
What do you think about that?
I know, right!? Being a teen is all about\nsnapping at adults for no good reason.
Well, it's not good to hold onto a grudge!\nI'd rather we fight and make up right after.
Ooh, you might be onto something.
Personally, fighting's welcome under my roof.
But maybe I did something that made him\ndislike me...
I have a son of my own you know. He found a\njob and left home just this year.
I always tried to be patient and\nunderstanding with him because of how rough\nmy relationship was with my parents.
We both thought it was best to stay out of\neach other's way... and so we never really\nbutt heads.
Sometimes he comes back home and brings me a\nlittle present.
But he always buys me these ridiculously\nfancy Japanese sweets and stuff.
There is! A big one!
Hello? Look, I know you're a growing boy,\nbut listen!
Anyway, I like my sweet red bean paste\nchunky. Always have, always will.
But he always gets smooth! Isn't that so sad?\nWe don't even know each other's preferences.
So now that I've been given this opportunity,\nI thought I'd do for my nephew what I\ncouldn't fo\u2014
I'm home, Kayo-san.
Oh, is this...?
Yes, this is {NAME2}-chan. He comes to talk\nwith me sometimes since we're neighbors.
This is Leo Kamiyama-chan, the nephew I'm\nalways talking about.
Hi there. Kayo-san's been kind enough to let\nme stay here. Nice to meet you!
Leo-chan's been going to a training program\nto be a... What kind of actor was it?
A costumed stuntman. Well, that still counts\nas an actor.
Those are the guys who perform in full body\nsuits and pull stunts in shows with heavy\nspecial effects.
Oh, right... Sorry, I still have trouble\nremembering exactly what it's called.
That's fine, really. Oh, {NAME1}-kun, do you\nlike superhero flicks?
That's great! I bet we'll get along\njust fine.
Haha. Well, then you must have some favorite\nRangers or Riders from your childhood!
Oh, that's what all the real fans say! Are\nyou secretly a superhero fanboy?
Phoenix Ranger Featherman, Red Eagle!
So yeah, that's my kind of thing. I'm really\ninto the classic stuff.
I'm still training right now, but I'm sending\nresumes everywhere I can.
I just have to keep practicing. No time for\ncomplaining or getting lazy. Anyway, nice\nmeeting you!
Well, that's him. He's a bit odd, but he's a\ngood kid all around.
In fact, he may be a little too good. How\ncould you ever fight with such a sweet boy?
But do you think that Leo-chan could secretly\ndislike me?
Really? I hope you're right...
Huh? Oh, maybe you're right. I'm probably\njust overthinking things.
Oh, right. I brought home some snacks.
Kayo-san, you like chunky red bean paste,\nright? These dorayaki are filled with it.
And while I'm here... {NAME1}-kun, could we\nswap contact info?
Okay, got it. Thanks! Talk to you later!
Oh. I guess he doesn't hate me at all...
And did you see how casually he asked for\nyour contact info? You kids really don't\nwaste any time.
To be honest, I still feel like I have a lot\nto learn about how teens feel.
But I think I figured something out today.
There are some things every generation can\nunderstand. There must be, right?
I'm feeling a lot more positive now after\nour talk.
Thank you, {NAME2}-chan.
Oh no! Kintsuba is hubby's favorite sweet!
I need to tell Leo-chan to save him some!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. How are you doing?
I was just hoping I'd run into you. Remember\nhow we talked about Leo-chan before?
Well I want your opinion on something. Do you\nhave some time now?
Really? Great! I'll make it quick then.\nI think it really will be short this time.
Really? Well, let me know when you have a\nmoment to spare, okay?
So, {NAME2}-chan, do you have a favorite\u2014
Oh! Welcome back, Leo-chan.
I was just talking to {NAME2}-chan about\ntomorrow.
You were? I spoke with him about it too.\nI know I just have to do my best.
I started imitating ranger heroes when I was\na kid because I thought they were cool.
I have to act like the perfect hero\u2014the kind\nI've pictured in my head since way back then.
But I don't have nearly enough time to\npractice. I shouldn't even be standing here\ntalking right now!
Sorry, but I've gotta get an early start\ntomorrow, so I'm gonna head inside.
See you around, {NAME1}-kun.
Leo-chan says he has some sort of big\naudition for a TV show.
Oh, anyway, as I was saying...
What's your favorite food to have in a bento,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Ooh, nice and hearty. And it even tastes\ngood cold.
It's a staple for a reason. And it's good\nsweet or savory!
Oh! Right, of course! I'm more of a rice\nperson as well!
In that case, for Leo-chan's lunch tomorrow\nI'll make...
Your favorite, plus some pork cutlets and\nbeefsteak!
And that won't be all! It'll be filled to the\nbrim with my love!
True. If this was for my hubby, I'd be a bit\nworried about his next checkup.
But Leo-chan's still young. I'm sure he'll\nburn it all off in no time.
Exactly! I'm so glad you get it!
Well, now that I know tomorrow's menu, that's\nall for today! Nice and quick!
I hope Leo-chan's audition goes well...
You know, my parents never supported my\ndreams when I was in high school.
I get along with them fine now, but I guess\nI was kind of a reckless kid.
Always hanging out with friends in Shibuya\ninstead of studying...
I mooched off of them constantly, only to\nturn around and say I wanted to be a stylist.
Naturally they were against it.
I understand their perspective now, but\nof course I rebelled back then.
I achieved my dream in the end, but they've\nstill never approved...
Oh, what am I even talking about? Sorry,\nI know I already said we were finished.
I feel almost unburdened when we talk. Like\nsome weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
Who needs a spa day!
I can just talk to you! Hehe.
See you later. Don't stay out too late just\nbecause your parents aren't home!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan. I'm glad I ran into\nyou here.
It's about Leo-chan again...
This time it's a little serious. Do you have\ntime to talk?
Really? That's great! This is a little too\nmuch for me to figure out alone.
Oh, okay. That's too bad. Could we talk when\nyou do have some time?
Remember what I told you about Leo-chan\nbefore?
Well, it sounds like his audition didn't go\nso well...
I want to encourage him, but I don't know\nwhat to say.
Oh, sorry, but I think that might do more\nharm than good.
Because, well...
That might be true, but... wouldn't you want\nto help if you were me?
Just what I'd expect a kid these days to say.\nI really want to help him if I can!
The thing about Leo-chan trying to make it as\nan actor is that he only has so much time.
He promised his parents he'd come home if he\ndidn't get anywhere within the year.
So I don't see it as someone else's problem.\nI want his dream to come true.
I guess the road to becoming a pro will\nalways have some obstacles...
But doesn't that make you want to help keep\nhis morale up, or at least try to?
Oh, I know! How about I serve him up a\ntasty meal?
Maybe that could help cheer him up?
His favorite... What is Leo-chan's favorite?
He never talks about his likes or dislikes.\nOh no! Do I know nothing about him?
It would seem unnatural if I suddenly started\nfussing over him, wouldn't it?
Oh, I see... Fussing over Leo-chan would just\nmake it harder on him.
It'd be so sad if I tried to help him, only\nfor it to have the opposite effect.
I guess the classic option is the best, huh?
Oh, but we had curry just yesterday. Won't he\nget sick of having it two nights in a row?
Sorry, I'll give it some more thought. Thanks\nfor helping me with something so tough!
Talk to you later then. Living alone can't be\neasy, but make sure to eat well!
Sorry for the sudden text. Do you have a\nsecond?
Kayo-san's been asking you for advice on all\nkinds of stuff, right?
I was wondering if I could ask you for some\nadvice myself.
Sorry. I know this is totally coming out of\nnowhere...
This might take a while. Could we meet\noutside in a bit?
{NAME1}-kun! Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Anyway, about my problem...
You heard from Kayo-san that my audition\ndidn't go well, right?
To be honest, I thought I gave a pretty\ndecent performance.
The issue was probably the interview that\ncame after.
No, nothing like that. I was never at a loss\nfor words at least.
What!? No! I'd never do that.
One of the judges asked me if there's\nanything special I keep in mind while I'm\nperforming.
He's a famous stuntman who's still active,\nso I figured I might as well be honest.
"To fully become the role asked of me,\nwhether that's a hero or a monster."
Or something along those lines anyway.
But then he looked all melancholic. Or maybe,\nawkwardly disappointed?
I feel like that was the wrong answer.
It's impossible for me to know what the right\nanswer for him would be.
But what do you think he wanted to hear?
Hm? I mean, the role the director wants me to\nperform...
Hm? Well, I want to express my own kind of...
Wait, but if I perform the way others expect\nme to, then my own style would be...
You know, I think I might've just found my\nanswer.
But it's still kind of vague. I need to think\non this some more.
Thanks for talking to me today. Now I see\nwhy Kayo-san comes to you all the time.
That's not true. Sure, you may not say\nmuch, but...
I think that's why what you do say really\ncuts deep.
It'd be great if I could ask you for advice\nagain. Oh, but don't tell Kayo-san, okay?
I'd feel bad if I made her worry over me.
Oh, {NAME2}-chan!
I was just hoping to talk to you. It's about\nLeo-chan, as usual.
Something came up that I need some advice on.\nDo you have a minute?
Really? Great! I'll make this short.
Really? Well, let me know when you have time\nto spare, okay?
So, just as I feared, Leo-chan's been down\never since that audition.
I've been doing what I can to act normal and\npretend like I haven't noticed.
But what I really want to do is hear him out,\nencourage him, cook him something tasty!
At the same time, I'm afraid that maybe he\ndoesn't want that at all. I feel stuck.
What in the world should I do?
Wouldn't it be easier for the both of us if I\njust stopped tiptoeing around it?
You're right... But I'm not a teen. I can't\nstop myself from worrying about him.
You think so? Wait, maybe you're onto\nsomething!
Who are you calling an old lady!?
Ah, but you're probably right about\nthe meddling part at least.
I wouldn't have come to you in the first\nplace if I wasn't so worried.
Be honest. How do you think Leo-chan would\nfeel about me getting so stressed over him?
Really? Huh... That's kind of a relief.
I was sweating up and down thinking he'd tell\nme to shut up or go away.
You saying that lifted my spirits a little.
So thanks. I'm not going to give up yet!
Okay, talk to you later. Be sure to brush\nyour teeth before bed, okay?
Sorry to bother you, but do you have a\nsecond?
Really? Then please, I need to ask you about\nsomething!
Oh. Well, okay then... When you have a\nmoment, I could really use your help.
What do I do? I really messed up this time.
You gave me all that advice, and I might as\nwell have flushed it down the drain!
Well, this is hard to say, but...
I'm sorry. It's just... I don't know what\nto do.
That's right. He...!
Leo-chan said he wanted to leave for a while\nto do some thinking.
He said he's going to stay with one of his\nseniors from the training school that lives\nnearby.
He gave me the address, said he was sorry for\nmaking me worry, and then left.
Leo-chan had been looking gloomy for so long,\nI went and opened my big mouth.
I suggested that things might go better if he\ntried keeping a positive attitude.
Then he went quiet for a while... and after\nthat he said he wanted to leave!
I'm such an idiot! Do you think he's mad\nat me?
Please, you have to tell me what I should do!
You will? Sorry for the trouble, but that'd\nbe a huge help.
But\u2014 Wait. Maybe it's best coming from\nanother boy his own age.
Okay... Please, do what you can,\n{NAME2}-chan.
I'm so clueless, running over there in a\npanic could just make things worse.
Oh, right. Here's the address Leo-chan left\nbehind.
Please help us... I don't mind if he doesn't\ncome back right away.
I'm fine with whatever he thinks is best for\nhim. I'll worry about the future later.
You actually came. It must have surprised you\nto hear the news from Kayo-san.
I left without giving it much thought, but to\nbe honest, I feel like I screwed up.
I just haven't been able to stop thinking\nabout that audition.
And about what you said to me, and about my\nacting.
Ultimately, I guess that judge was trying\nto tell me to express more of myself in my\nroles.
Even heroes are flesh-and-blood humans who\nhave their own emotions.
What's important as an actor is putting that\ninto a performance. Otherwise it'll be flat.
I've been all wrong from the start. I only\never thought about acting like a cool hero.
Now I realize, I've been working toward being\nboring and one-dimensional\nthis whole time.
That shallow goal led me to ignore the people\nin my life and my own feelings.
It was the only thing that mattered.\nEverything else was just noise.
I acted like it was pointless engaging with\npeople who don't know about the films I love.
Then when things didn't go my way, I panicked\nand started shutting everyone out.
I knew that Kayo-san was worrying about me,\nbut I thought I didn't have time to care.
How narcissistic am I?
I just walked out on Kayo-san's hospitality\nwithout giving it a second thought.
And I know how concerned she gets. She's\nprobably worried sick about me right now.
I can't face her after everything I've done.\nHah...
Do you think she'll forgive me?
Do you really think so? I can still fix\nthings?
Thank you. To be honest, I think I was\nlooking for a reason to go back.
As pathetic as it sounds, some part of me was\nhoping someone would come get me.
I never imagined it'd be you though. Looks\nlike you're the real hero here.
Let me just thank my senior for letting me\ncrash. Can you wait a minute?
Leo-chan...!
Kayo-san. I'm... I'm so sorry!
Um, I've been\u2014
It's okay! You don't need to explain a thing!
Oh, thank goodness! Welcome home, Leo-chan.
{NAME2}-chan, thank you!
Let's go home and have some dinner.
Oh, is that {NAME2}-chan?
Perfect timing. Leo-chan and I were just\nabout to go shopping together.
Are you busy? I'm going to make us a nice\ndinner if you'd like to join.
This can be my way of thanking you for all\nyou've done for us!
Really? All right, but come see us when\nyou're free, okay?
Okay, let's head to the supermarket. But you\nonly get to pick one snack each, got it?
We're really going to splurge today. Let's\nload up on sukiyaki beef!
Whoa! There's no way I can eat this much!
Being a stuntman takes a lot out of you,\ndoesn't it? And you're still a growing boy!
Not to mention {NAME2}-chan is joining us.\nWe'll demolish all of this no problem!
Okay, I think that's just about everything.
Hubby said he'll be home early today, so I'll\nneed to get started right away!
I'm going to head straight home. What about\nyou two?
I was going to talk to {NAME1}-kun for a bit\nmore before going back.
Sure. Just don't come home too late!
That goes for you too, {NAME2}-chan.\nNo shying out from dinner now!
So as you can see, Kayo-san and I are really\ngetting along now.
And it's all thanks to you, {NAME1}-kun.
You can. I'm sorry for making you worry too.
Well, about that...
You think so? Maybe I've matured a bit after\nall of this.
I told Kayo-san everything I told you\nthat day.
Then she told me all about how she'd been\nfeeling.
We were both being overly careful around each\nother, which led to a big misunderstanding.
So we decided that from now on, we'll be open\nand honest with each other.
And that's why I'm leaving... again.
We're having sukiyaki today as my farewell\nparty.
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.
Yeah, but that's actually why I was able to\nbe completely honest with her about this.
No, not at all! Well, okay... Maybe a little.
But that's not why I'm leaving.
This isn't about being annoyed by other\npeople, it's about what I have to do for\nmyself.
Now that I understand what I'm trying to do,\nbeing near people who fuss over me...
Well, it feels like I might just end up\nmooching off them.
I really do appreciate Kayo-san's support.\nIt's super encouraging.
Especially considering my parents aren't as\napproving. But I think she's done enough.
Now I need to really face myself and create\nmy own form of expression.
Think of it like a superhero training\nmontage. I think that's what's next for me.
Oh, we should probably head back! Don't want\nKayo-san to worry again.
I'm really grateful for everything you've\ndone, {NAME1}-kun.
I'll do my best to make sure you'll see me on\nTV one day.
But we can talk about that some other time.\nLet's go eat some sukiyaki!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan.
Perfect. There's something I want to talk to\nyou about.
Do you have time?
Really? Great! I'll make this quick.
Really? Well, let me know when you have a\nmoment, okay?
I just finished seeing Leo-chan off.
As of today, it's back to two people around\nour dinner table, which is... a little sad.
Thanks again for helping me with him. I think\nI really would've been lost on my own.
But I learned a lot through all of this.
Including the fact that I still have a lot\nleft to learn from others, even at my age...
I was a little surprised by everything that\nhappened.
As much as I don't want to admit it, I guess\nthis is what the generation gap feels like.
You said it. I even got you wrapped up in it.
I'm not so sure about that one. You're pretty\nodd, {NAME2}-chan.
The days I spent fighting with my parents\nfeel so fresh all of a sudden.
Some kids today have the exact same problems\nI had back then.
But now I realize there are other kids with\nproblems completely different than mine.
I suppose you really can't assume that\neveryone's on the same page as you.
I mostly ended up going in circles.
I didn't plan on it, but I guess we are.
{NAME2}-chan... Was that your idea of a\ncompliment?
I thought I could help him with anything as\nlong as I tried.
But it wasn't that simple in the end.
Like Leo-chan hitting that creative wall...
That's not an easy thing to help someone get\nover, is it?
And having someone fret over you while you're\nalready having a hard time is bound to get\nannoying.
Looking back, I should've just kept an eye on\nhim instead of panicking like I did.
You were thinking that this whole time!? You\nshould have told me then!
Oh wait. Maybe you did say something along\nthose lines and I just didn't catch it...
I know! It's easy to say all of that, but\nwhen it's really happening to you...
That's right. It is a lesson. That you helped\nteach me, {NAME2}-chan.
Besides, even if I'd done everything right\nand things worked out well...
It'd really be no thanks to me anyway.
He's the one who's working hard, so his\nsuccess is his own.
You shouldn't dwell on other people's\nproblems as if they're your own. But if\nthings go well for them...
...you should be as happy as if it were you!\nIs that the kind of thing you learn with age?
If it is, then maybe getting older isn't so\nbad after all.
Not that I'm hoping to get older any\ntime soon!
If a young person ever comes to me for help\nagain, I'm going to handle it a lot better.
It's been a while, so how about we get back\nto our usual routine? My way of saying\nthanks!
Here you are. I think you know how this goes.
Fresh!
Ah! I need to get a bath ready for my hubby!
Okay then, {NAME2}-chan. See you next time\nI need some advice on something!
No way, that's for me? I do like this kind of\nthing, you know!
It's a little scary how you can guess what\nI like, even at my age...
Oh, of course I meant that in a good way!\nYou're just awful sometimes, you little\nplayer...
Oh, this is for me?
Nice one! That kind of thoughtfulness will\nmake you popular with the girls, you know?
Well, look who it is. Do you need something,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Where do you wanna head to?
Aww, oh well. Let's chat another time, 'kay?
You wanna go there, {NAME2}-chan? Okey\ndokey, let's go!
Err, that's a no go, {NAME2}-chan. Got\nanother place in mind?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan! Are you free?
Would you like to hang out with me? I'd like\nto learn more about what teens are into these\ndays.
Aw, thanks! This is a little much for me to\nfigure out all on my own, you see.
Really? That's too bad. Maybe when you have\nsome time, okay?
Harajuku! It feels like it's been forever...\nI want to say I was here all the time as\na kid.
Seems like it's still the center of all the\nlatest trends. I'm glad that's stayed the\nsame.
That does mean things change so fast here,\nthough. I wonder if any of the shops I know\nare still around.
I know it's a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm\nsure they must exist, right?
A place that stays on top of trends even as\nit ages... Just like what I'm trying to do!
Just how old do you think I am!?
Aah, I guess you're not wrong to ask. I know\nmore shops from way before the current\ngeneration was even born.
Aaanyway, now that we're here, it's time for\nmy dose of youthful experience\u2014 ah, I mean,\nyouthful inspiration!
Ooh, I know what's popular these days.\nPopcorn, right?
S-Seriously!? Well, that's Harajuku for you.\nHere one minute and gone the next!
More interested in chow than charm, huh?\nWell, now you've got my tummy growling.
Why don't we look around and stop to nibble\non anything that looks yummy along the way?
Ooh, I came here with my hubby\nwhen I was younger!
But he was dozing off before I even knew it!\nI can't believe it's been so long since I was\nlast here.
Though I'm sure you'd rather be here with\nsomeone closer to your own age, right\n{NAME2}-chan?
That's a good way to look at it. Just to warn\nyou, it'd be a real mood-killer if you fell\nasleep too.
Of course, that didn't stop me from being\nhead over heels for my hubby! Hehe.
Don't worry! My hubby isn't nearly that\nsmall-minded.
Besides, a pinch of jealousy can be the trick\nto keeping a marriage from growing stale!
Although I have a feeling that teens would\nrather hang out somewhere more fun than a\nplanetarium.
Isn't it boring? You know, unless you're\nreally into the stars or something.
Huh, I didn't expect that! Then how about you\ntell me all about them?
Oh? I know more about them than you might\nexpect too. There was this anime, you see...
The stars are supposed to look pretty\ntonight. Want to take a look at the sky?
Do young people tend to go on dates to places\nlike this these days?
So many of them, yourself included, just feel\nmore mature than we were back then, you know?
Or maybe it's just me? I may have grown\nolder, but I still feel just as young at\nheart...
You think so too? I mean, being an adult is\nnothing to be proud of on its own...
But it does trouble me to know that I don't\nhave the... dignity that comes with age?
Oh my! You certainly have a way with words.
I'm sure you're just saying that to be nice,\nbut I'll accept the compliment. Thank you!
All right then! How about I start acting like\nthe adult here and take the lead?
Of course, I do love my hubby, so let's just\nenjoy Odaiba in a nice, wholesome way.
Isn't there an amusement park over there?\nSomething-or-other-polis?
Let's go visit that today. I haven't been\nthere in a while!
I bet the rides are more impressive than they\nused to be, too. Ooh, this is so exciting!
C'mon, {NAME2}-chan! Hurry up!
So this is the station closest to your\nschool? I guess you must always be using it,\nthen!
How lovely. It's like you can smell the youth\nin the air here!
Well, maybe I should've said it's the\natmosphere. It reminds me of my student days.
Like a ghost of my youth? A time I can never\ngo back to again.
No, of course not! I don't mean a literal\nsmell, you know.
Wait, but maybe it does smell a little funky\nhere... No, I must be imagining it!
I took the train in high school too. I'd wait\nfor my now hubby, and we'd go home together.
Of course we'd always take a detour. Like,\n"Where to today?" Oh, those were the days!
Oh, I know! Nothing says "heading home from\nschool" like buying a yummy treat on the way!
What snacks do you and your friends usually\nbuy around here, {NAME2}-chan?
Croquettes? Sounds great! If my memory serves\nme... my hubby and I used to love those.
Oh, right. Isn't this area known for curry?\nThe curry bread must be delicious, then!
Well, that decides it. Let's go grab\nsomething to eat right away.
Well, want to head out on a neighborhood\npatrol?
I haven't gone to the movies in forever! My\nhubby and I just stream them at home.
Not that I'm complaining, but there is\nsomething special about going to a theater!
You're young, {NAME2}-chan. I imagine you\ndon't go to the movies much either, right?
I thought so. But movies are impressive on\nanother level when you see them here.
You can't get things like big, booming sound\nwhen you're watching at home!
A what...? Wow, you sound like a real expert!
What a surprise! I heard that kids don't go\nto the movies anymore, but I guess some of\nthem do!
And don't they have that 3D and 4D stuff now?\nTheaters are really changing with the times.
Oh, I suppose they had those 3D glasses when\nI was a kid. You know, with the red and blue\nlenses?
I guess you still wear glasses, but they\ndon't have those tacky colored lenses\nanymore!
Huh? It's not like we're talking about the\nprimary colors here! Never mind, I guess you\ndon't know.
Oh, the movie's about to start! We should\nhead to our seats.
I heard that it's best to avoid the phrase\n"back in my day." I have to keep up with the\nyoungsters!
At places like this, showing off your\nknowledge of the night sky would surely make\nyour popularity skyrocket... right?
So much to do, so much to see! What should we\ncheck out today?
Doing the walk to school like this after all\nthese years feels strangely nostalgic to me.
So, what's the movie for today? If it's any\ngood, I'll drag my hubby along next time and\nmake him watch it!
Oh, {NAME2}-chan! Have a minute? I know I\nshouldn't worry about this, but...
Have you been keeping on top of your\nhousehold chores? When you're alone, it's\neasy to neglect them, right?
So I was thinking, I'd be more than happy to\noffer you... my special housekeeping service!
Oh, of course, I won't charge you a dime,\n{NAME2}-chan. How could I after everything\nyou've done for me?
Oh, glad to hear you're on board! Time\nto bust out the mop and bucket. To\n{NAME2}-chan's house!
Oh my, is it really that messy? Well when\nyou need a hand, just say the word, okay\n{NAME2}-chan?
Wow, it's cleaner than I thought! Honestly,\nI'm surprised.
My son's idea of cleaning was just to\nrearrange the mess!
Oh {NAME2}-chan, you diligent young man!\nI wish my son was here to hear this.
Now I'm worried about him... I wonder if he's\nlooking after himself properly...
*gasp* You're right. I am, aren't I?
When someone refuses to clean when I tell\nthem to, then I know I'm gonna have to roll\nup my sleeves...
Well, I'm here now, so might as well be\nthorough.
Aha! What have we here? Look at all this\ndust!
H-Hey! Who're you calling... Oh, I suppose\nyou have a point.
I should seriously try to suppress my inner\nmom instincts... Lesson learned!
Stepmom? Wait, are you seriously thinking of\nus as family for realsies!?
Shut up, could you even imagine? We'd get\nalong so well!
Oh, look at me babbling. Let's get back on\ntrack. Cleaning! That's why we're here!
I'm gonna send all those li'l dust bunnies\nhoppin' into the trash can one by one!
And if my prying eyes were to come across\nanything... suspicious, I'll be sure to keep\nmy mouth shut!
Tomiyama cleaned every nook\nand cranny of my house and\neven cooked for me.
As always, not a speck of dust in sight! Oh,\nwhat a relief!
Let's put it somewhere else...
It sounds beneficial.
I explained as best I could,\nbut it still came out vague.
I feel my bond with Merope\ngrowing deeper...
I don't think she's going to\nlet this go...
Looks like I'll have to go\nalong with this.
I don't think that's why...
I should stop her.
She ignored me.
However, I feel my bond with\nMerope growing deeper...
Merope seems dead set on this\nphoto session...
If I want to, I can keep\nfulfilling her requests and\naccompany her.
Narumi's shoot is taking place\nin this shop.
Merope is holding a fat stack\nof tickets.
All that knowledge she\ndemonstrated a second ago flew\nout the window.
Merope looks like she's on\ncloud nine.
Despite the mishap,\nMerope looks thrilled.
Merope looks proud of herself.
Narumi's coworkers returned\nto the caf\xe9.
That's the man we saw at\nNarumi's workplace.
It must be that\nproducer's Shadow.
He looks like he's had a\nchange of heart.
I should report back\nto Merope.
The target should be in\nthis area.
Let's look around...
For Narumi and Merope's sake,\nwe need to change that rotten\nproducer's heart...
Ready to go in?
I feel a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Merope...
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Merope...
I went to the con caf\xe9\nwith Merope and had\nthe time of my life.
I headed out with Merope...
Merope and I chatted at the\nplanetarium. My heart raced\nfor more reasons than one.
Merope and I chatted at the\nplanetarium. She taught me\nabout the zodiac.
Merope and I chatted at the\nplanetarium. The couple next\nto us flirted the whole time.
Merope and I chatted at the\nplanetarium. It was so\nrelaxing, I nodded off.
Merope and I chatted at the\nplanetarium. She counted each\nstar one by one.
Merope and I chatted at the\nplanetarium. My thoughts\nwandered to distant galaxies.
Merope and I watched a movie\ntogether. We shared our\nthoughts on it.
Merope and I watched a movie\ntogether. She asked me\nto explain the plot twist.
Merope and I watched a movie\ntogether... and then another.
Merope and I watched a movie\ntogether. We bought\nsouvenir pamphlets.
Merope and I watched\na movie together. She drank\nall the soda...
Merope and I watched a movie\ntogether. Her eyes were glued\nto the idol actress.
I only just managed to stop\nMerope from barging into\nthe school...
Merope and I walked around the\nschool grounds. I warned her\nshe can't drop by whenever.
Merope and I walked around the\nschool grounds. We bought\nsnacks on the way home.
Merope and I walked around the\nschool grounds. She suddenly\nwent for a run mid-tour.
Merope and I walked around the\nschool grounds. People thought\nshe was my older sister.
Merope showed me around\nJinbocho. I found some old\nmanga I'd been looking for.
Merope showed me around\nJinbocho. I had to carry her\nidol magazines...
Merope showed me around\nJinbocho. I learned all about\npast idols.
Merope showed me around\nJinbocho. I bought books about\nworld mythology.
Merope showed me around\nJinbocho. We took a breather\nto enjoy some delicious curry.
Merope showed me around\nJinbocho. I spotted the first\nissue of a manga magazine.
I tried to explain to Merope\nwhat makes riding a Ferris\nwheel with somebody romantic.
Merope and I rode the Ferris\nwheel. It was awkward.
Merope and I rode the Ferris\nwheel. The kids in the next\ngondola were staring at us.
Merope and I rode the Ferris\nwheel. The view was nice, but\nit was mentally exhausting.
Merope and I rode the Ferris\nwheel. We stared at each other\nin silence.
Merope and I rode the Ferris\nwheel. I had to stop her from\nshaking the gondola.
Merope and I rode the Ferris\nwheel. The operator stared at\nus as we got on and off.
Oh, that's right, I have\nsomething Merope might like...
Should I give this to Merope?
Merope and I went back to\nmy place.
Merope scanned the room from\ntop to bottom... It made me a\nbit uneasy.
I relaxed in my room with\nMerope. She pelted me with\nquestions, but it was fun.
Seems like Merope wants to\nsay something. I should go\nto the Velvet Room.
Seems like Merope has an\nimportant matter to discuss. I\nshould go to the Velvet Room.
She ignored my order...
Putting her methods aside, I\ncould sense Merope was being\nthoughtful... in her own way.
I got the sense that, in her\nown way, Merope was being\nthoughtful as always.
Spending time with Motoha,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
I feel my bond with Motoha\ngrowing deeper...
I swung the bat while\nlistening to Motoha's advice.
I parted ways with a\nshaky-kneed Motoha.
Exhausted, I parted ways\nwith Motoha.
I walked with Motoha\nto Zoshigaya.
The bat's making\ncontact, but...
Her hitting power\nseems limited...
It's still way better than the first time we\ncame here. She's only getting better.
I trained at the batting cages\nwith Motoha.
She's been swinging that bat\nnonstop for about an hour.
Her precision is getting\nworse, but...
Motoha sure is serious\nabout this...
Motoha's working her butt off.
But I don't see her hitting\nany home runs at this rate.
Motoha and I left the\nbatting cages together.
Motoha batted her all today.
But no home runs yet...
That must have been back when\nMotoha still admired Kiuchi...
I understand where she's\ncoming from, but...
I've been talking for a while.\nI should get back to Motoha.
Seems like she was really\nimmersed in her practice...
Judging by her expression,\nI'm guessing she hasn't hit\nany home runs yet.
I left the batting cages with\nMotoha, who by all accounts is\npushing herself too hard.
Seems she's been swinging\nthis whole time.
Motoha looks happy...
I feel a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Motoha...
I left the diner with Motoha.
I am now in a relationship\nwith Motoha...
Motoha and I finished eating,\nthen headed home.
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Motoha...
I had ice cream with Motoha\nbefore heading home.
Motoha and I spent some time\nalone together...
I agreed to help Motoha...

Motoha and I watched a movie.\nWe talked about our favorite\nparts late into the night.
Seems like Motoha wants to\ntalk. I should go and see her.
Looks like Motoha wants to\ntalk about movies. I should\nhead over now...
Oh, that's right. I have\nsomething Motoha might like...
Should I give this to Motoha?
Can he sense my Persona?
I feel like I can't leave\nKurotani to act on his own.
Spending time with Kurotani,\nI feel hope rising\nwithin me...
I feel my bond with Kurotani\ngrowing deeper...
I received a Rare Book from\nKurotani and left the library.
There is a spot where no\nplants are growing.
Well, now I wanna step there.

Kurotani and I investigated\negg noodles in Ogikubo. No\nthreats, but it was tasty.
Kurotani and I investigated\nchashu wonton soup in Ogikubo.\nNo threats, but it was divine!
Should I log on to\nHarvest World Online?
If I start now, I'll get a\nfree plot of land.
I decided to log on to\nHarvest World Online.
I'll pass for now.
I've arrived in\nHarvest World Online.
I'm surrounded by empty space\nas far as I can see. This must\nbe my free plot of land.
So, will you let me have it? Or perhaps not?
This Yui girl seems to want\nmy plot of land.
I received it for free,\nso it feels weird to\nask her for money.
I told Yui she can\nhave it for free.
Huh!? Nonsense! I can't accept without\noffering fair compensation!
But you won't take my money? Hmmm...
I have a great idea! Let's say it belongs to\nboth of us!
I'll give you the right to decide what we do\nwith it!
Come on! Don't just stand there blinking at\nme! Start throwing out some ideas!
Need a little smack in the head with this\nstack of cash to get the juices flowing?
Three, two, one... Speak!
A farm? You want to make our land into\na farm?
What a fantastic idea!
You would like to grow crops and such on\nour land?
Oh, you're hungry?
It'd be great if we could grow food here...
Food... Yes! That's certainly an interesting\nidea.
It's settled, then. We'll turn this land into\nour farm!
You know, I am actually quite confident in my\nhorticultural talents!
And what a huge plot! I can't wait to put it\nto use!
Yui and I decided to create a\nfarm in the virtual world.
I feel my bond with Yui\ngrowing deeper...
Now that we've made our decision, there's\nmuch to be done!
I'll make sure to prepare all the tools we\nneed by the time we next meet.
Good day then! Until we meet again!
I promised to meet Yui again,\nthen logged out.
I wonder how the farm I\nstarted with Yui is going.
Should I log in to\nHarvest World Online?
I logged in to\nHarvest World Online.
Maybe later.
I arrived at the field where\nYui and I promised to start\na farm together.
The door slid shut\non its own...
Kurotani and I parted ways\noutside the Evil AV Room.
I received a Rare Book from\nKurotani and left the roof.
But I'm already full...
I received a Rare Book\nfrom Kurotani and left\nthe rooftop.
After consuming a\nsickening amount of milk,\nI left the rooftop.
I received a Rare Book,\nand parted ways with\nKurotani and Take.
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Kurotani...
Kurotani and I talked\nand drank milk to\nour hearts' content.
The ground is already plowed\nand ready for sowing. Did Yui\ndo all this?
Hey there! Where've you been?
While you were away, I prepared the plot for\nfarming.
With this tractor!
Now it's fields and fields as far as the eye\ncan see! Isn't it amazing!?
Let's keep it up and grow this farm bigger\nand bigger!
Since you're finally here, I'd like us to\nplant something today.
You may be right about that!
What a shame. I wanted to ride the tractor a\nlittle longer.
My! For someone with such a stoic face,\nyou're pretty ambitious!
But tilling alone won't make our crops grow.
So, what should we plant first?
Then let's go with cyber potatoes! With good\nsoil, they shouldn't need much tending.
Best of all, potatoes are both delicious and\nfilling!
Now let's head to town and buy seeds!
I'll drive! Come sit in the passenger\nseat, um...
I guess I haven't asked your name yet.
I see you haven't set one either.
Did you have trouble deciding?
Well, until you do, I'll think up a temporary\nname for you!
Hmmm... You grow potatoes, so you can be...\nPotato-kun!
Uh, maybe not.
How about Russet? That's a kind of potato.
Plus, it kind of sounds like it could be a\nname anyway.
That's the most important thing! Happy to\nwork with you, Russet.
There's nothing embarrassing about russets.\nYou should wear that potato with pride!
Russets aren't good enough for you? You\nreally are ambitious!
However, we've only just begun our farming\njourney. We shouldn't aim too high just yet.
Now that we've decided what to call you...
Let's head to town together! Russet, hop into\nthe passenger seat, if you please!
Great! We got ourselves some excellent seeds!\nNow we need to buy fertilizer.
Oh! You there...
Oh, that's a shame. I would've liked to have\na chat...
Ah! That's right! The fertilizer store! I'll\nbe right back.
Sorry for the wait! I got the fertilizer!
Oh? Were you two having a conversation?
I'm sorry. I didn't get in the way, did I?
Thank goodness. That person is rather timid,\nyou know!
Now that we have everything we need, it's\ntime to head back to the farm!
Did something happen between\nYui and that guy?
Wait, I shouldn't stick\nmy nose in other\npeople's business.
Russet! I'm setting this down here!
The two of us chatted\nwhile planting seeds,\nthen I logged off.
I wonder how the fields\nare doing.
I logged on to\nHarvest World Online.
Maybe next time.
Looks like our seeds haven't\nsprouted yet.
Where's Yui?
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Our field is rather large, so I went to buy\nus this big hose!
It sprays water quite well, although it is a\nlittle difficult to control.
I'm sorry about that. Good thing you have\nsharp reflexes.
Now our seeds have plenty of water!
They should start to sprout before long!
Well, caring for crops in this world is much\neasier than it is in real life.
Actual farming is much more difficult,\nI assure you.
Weather is always a factor, and then there's\nthe insects!
Ugh, insects... Just thinking about them\ngives me the creeps!
But if we hadn't met...
I never would've thought to turn this land\ninto a farm.
Can I tell you something?
Back when things were a little livelier\naround here...
I had the opportunity to meet lots of new\npeople every day.
I'd try to talk to them whenever I could.
But after chatting for a while, I'd never see\nthem again!
There was that guy the other\nday who seemed to know Yui...
The person we met in town the other day was\none of them.
I'm not worried about it. We've bumped into\neach other a few times before.
Maybe after some time has passed, we'll be\nable to talk like we used to.
Nothing in particular comes to mind.
That said, perhaps I upset him somehow\nwithout realizing it.
It doesn't seem like I've done anything to\nwarrant apologizing.
I've asked him as much before, and he said\neverything was fine.
I do have some idea of what could be the\nmatter...
But if I can't be myself, then there's no\npoint in me being here!
For a while I thought it might be easier for\nme to play alone.
But it's so much more fun having someone to\ntalk to!
I'm so happy to hear you say that!
Yes! I'd like to continue talking with you\nand cultivating the fields together!
Of course! Meeting you reminded me how fun it\nis to spend time with other people.
Oh no! The soil is drying out!
We must hydrate the fields. Come along,\nRusset!
I'll hold the end of the hose. You support\nthe middle, Russet!
The two of us talked while\nwatering the fields,\nthen I logged out.
I wonder if the crops\nI planted with Yui\nare doing all right.
I signed in to\nHarvest World Online.
I'll play another time.
The crops are sprouting!
Exhilarating!
Yui doesn't seem to have\nnoticed me. Should I\ncall out to her?
This feels great!
Oh, hello there, Russet!
It is! Very much so! Would you like to try,\nRusset?
Oh, what a shame. We've run out of\nfertilizer.
Exactly what it looks like! I'm spraying\nfertilizer!
Isn't it wonderful? I bought it in town!
As you can see, our cyber potatoes have\nbegun sprouting.
I want them to grow big and strong, so I've\nstarted adding fertilizer.
Vegetables need nutrients to grow just like\npeople do!
Oh, I can't wait till they're ready! We'll\nhave ourselves the largest cyber potatoes\never!
What do you think we should cook with them!?
Are there any potato dishes you're\nparticularly fond of, Russet?
Wow! What a coincidence!
Soft, fluffy potatoes infused with the rich\nflavor of the broth...
Just picturing it makes me smile.
Oh, I always buy that from food stands.
I recommend trying it with salted squid\non top.
I love french fries so much.
When they're freshly fried, crisp on the\noutside, and fluffy on the inside!
That perfect combination of sweet and salty\nstarch is irresistible!
Oh my. I'm getting a bit too excited.
I've gone to hamburger shops just to order\nfries before.
Speaking of burgers...
There's a restaurant in Shibuya that sells\nenormous ones.
My friend told me that she wants to go but\ndoesn't have anyone to go with her.
From the look on your face, I guess you're\nwondering why I don't go.
Unfortunately, that's not possible.
Hmmm, how should I put this?
My friend and I share the same body...
No, it's a friend of mine!
Russet, if it's not too much trouble...
Would you mind going to the burger shop with\nmy friend?
Of course, you're free to refuse!
I decided to accept\nher invitation.
Thank you! I'm sure my friend will be\nthrilled!
My friend loves french fries too, so she'll\nbe looking forward to it!
Please show my friend a good time! Goodbye!
I promised to go to the\nburger shop in Shibuya\nwith Yui's "friend."
Maybe I should message her.
I made a promise to meet\nYui's friend in person.
Maybe we should meet up today.
I sent a message to Yui asking\nif her friend wants to go to\nthe burger shop today.
She replied right away.\nApparently, her friend\nsaid yes.
Off to Shibuya.
Maybe not today.
I arrived at the burger shop.\nI wonder if that woman\nis Yui's "friend."
The large portions made it\na struggle, but we finished\nour meal.
Through Musubi, I feel my bond\nwith Yui growing deeper...
We left the burger shop,\nand parted ways.
I wonder how our crops\nare doing.
I booted up\nHarvest World Online.
I'll hold off for now.
The leaves are growing nice\nand large. The fertilizer\nmust be working.
Grow, grow, potatoes! Grow, grow!
I know you can do better than that! Let me\nsee your budding potential!
Oh! Hello there, Russet.
Yes! Real farm work takes grit!
What does it look like? I'm helping the\npotatoes grow!
Yes! I'm trying to get them to turn over a\nnew leaf!
You see, their leaves haven't been growing\nwell lately.
I wonder why. I've been giving them plenty of\nwater and fertilizer...
C'mon, potatoes! Get it together already.
Oh no! The roots are weak!
Here too!? There too!? Why is this\nhappening!?
At this rate, they'll wither and die before\nwe get to harvest them!
The soil is moist, so that shouldn't be it.
Too much water can be bad for the crops\nanyway. It must be something else.
It's fertilizer made specifically for cyber\npotatoes, so that can't be the case.
It must be something else.
Pests? That must be it!
It is!
Look at this. Bite marks on the roots!
We may be dealing with potato moles here!
They eat the roots of young cyber potatoes.
But we caught on to them too late.
I inspected the crops with\nYui. The damage has spread\nto the entire field.
Why does trouble follow me wherever I go!?
Thank you for trying to cheer me up, Russet.\nYou're very kind.
I don't think I can take much more than this.\nSorry, I'll have to call it a day.
Yui seems really down.
I wonder if there's anything\nI can do to help.
After getting rid of the\nmoles, I gave the potatoes\nmore fertilizer.
I'll make sure to come back\nand tend the fields regularly.
I wonder how the crops\nare doing lately.
Should I check out\nHarvest World Online?
I signed on to\nHarvest World Online.
It looks like Yui hasn't\nvisited our field since the\nlast time I saw her.
I'll tend to the fields\non my own.
Seems like the potato moles\nwon't be coming back.
The farm's going to be\njust fine.
Wh-What's going on here!?
They're not withering! They're growing\nhealthily again!
Hello. It's been a while.
But never mind that! Look at the farm! Did\nyou do all this yourself?
I told Yui that I got rid\nof the moles while\nshe was offline.
You scared off the moles with high-pitched\nsound waves? Where did you get that idea?
Other farmers, huh?
It's true moles have sensitive eardrums, so\nhigh frequency noises can drive them away.
We used to do the same thing at our farm back\nhome! Well done, Russet!
Did the clerk from the shop where I bought\nthe fertilizer tell you?
If they sell fertilizer, they must know a lot\nabout pests too! Good thinking!
So you kept trying until it worked out?
Amazing job, Russet!
The leaves are healthier than ever.
They must be growing so quickly because the\nmoles are gone.
Why, just looking at these healthy potatoes\nmakes me feel so much better!
I'm really sorry, Russet.
I had some stuff going on that prevented me\nfrom checking on the fields for a while.
But from now on, I'll try to make time every\nday to keep our crops healthy!
I mean, it's the least I can do after you\nworked so hard to save them!
Besides, I'm not the type to mope around\nforever!
Hehe, that makes me happy. But don't overdo\nit, okay?
This place is for us to unwind. It'd be no\nfun if we forced ourselves.
You can come and check things out when it's\nconvenient for you!
I'll be waiting!
If that happens, I'll be the one to deal with\nit next time!
I can't let you do all the work, Russet!
Oh no! I forgot something important!
I haven't thanked you for all you've done.
Thank you so much, Russet. I'm really glad\nwe're working on this farm together.
The potatoes would have withered if you\nweren't here.
But with us working together, we can tackle\nanything that comes our way.
And it's much more fun with the two of us!
Yui seems like she's back\nto her old self.
I feel a deep sense of trust\nbetween me and Yui...
We tended the fields together,\nthen logged out.
I wonder how our potatoes are.
Should I hang out in\nHarvest World Online?
I went on to\nHarvest World Online.
I think I'll pass.
She doesn't seem to be around.\nI should look for her.
Nothing has been planted\nin this area yet.
No signs of Yui here.
A helicopter is heading\nthis way!
That was my first time riding one of those!\nIt was exhilarating to say the least!
Do you want to take it for a ride later?\nLooking down at the whole field is such fun!
Scattering seeds, of course!
I rented it!
We haven't planted anything here yet, so I\nwas scattering cyber watermelon seeds.
I learned my lesson from the whole potato\ndebacle.
Of course it's important to take measures to\nprotect our fields, but...
I think if we also plant a variety of\ndifferent crops, they'll have a better chance\nof surviving.
Like, even if the potato moles come back,\nthe watermelons shouldn't be affected.
Surely, they're called potato moles for a\nreason, right!?
Right? Glad we're on the same page!
Of course it makes sense! Don't think about\nit too hard!
I'm really happy to hear you say that!
I really feel best when I'm true to myself!
But I haven't neglected to prepare a defense\nstrategy either!
After doing some research, I learned that\ncyber watermelon plants attract insects.
So once they start growing, we'll need to\ncover them up to keep them protected.
And wouldn't you know it? I have just the\nthing we need!
Yeah, we won't have a repeat of the potato\nincident on my watch.
Once the fruits start to grow, we'll cover\nthem up together!
Of course, we should always expect the\nunexpected.
But I'm sure the two of us can deal with\nwhatever comes our way.
Oh, you look sullen. Do you hate insects?
Musubi does too!
Oh, that reminds me. Have you ever grown\nplants in real life, Russet?
Really? I'd love to see you in action!
Musubi also seems interested in growing\nplants.
But she struggles with insects, doesn't she?
Even though she can face them in-game, she\ndoesn't think she can handle real insects!
If you ever meet with Musubi again, try to\ngive her some encouragement.
Her work has calmed down a little, so she has\na bit of downtime now.
If I go to Shibuya, I might\nbe able to see Matsukata.\nMaybe I'll go soon.
We both logged out\nafter tending to the\nfields together.
It's from Yui.
Yui's "friend" Matsukata\nis wondering if we can\nmeet in Shibuya.
I decided to go and meet\nwith Matsukata...
I have other things to do,\nso I told Yui I'm busy.
We promised to meet again\nonline, then I walked her\nto the ticket gate.
I wonder how the farm\nis doing.
I entered\nHarvest World Online.
I'll play another day.
The crops seem to be\ngrowing well.
That sounded like an\nexplosion. I should\ngo check it out.
Oh, hello there, Russet. Your timing couldn't\nbe better!
To check out this huge plot of land!
I've been expanding our land!
Of course you did. I was blowing things up!
I found myself wanting a bigger field for us!
So I'm blowing up the mountains to make\nmore land!
By the way, I heard from Musubi that her\nbasil is growing nicely.
Her success has motivated me to work\nharder too!
Unfortunately, it sounds like she hasn't been\nas successful in training her junior.
But she said she's not going to dwell on it,\nand she won't let that kind of stuff hold her\nback anymore!
After all, it's only natural to experience\nsetbacks when doing things you struggle with.
I, too, have had a lot of trouble with\ninterpersonal relationships in the past.
But because I didn't give up, and I reached\nout to you, now here we are!
To be perfectly honest, it took a lot of\ncourage to call out to you back then.
It's all thanks to you to that Musubi and I\nare where we are today, Russet.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Thank you. Musubi and I are both trying our\nhardest.
But that's only possible because of all the\nsupport you've given us.
How could we not give it our all when you're\nhere cheering us on?
Hehehe, no need to be so humble. Please,\naccept my thanks.
You may think of it as a mere push, but it\nwas a huge step forward for me!
Ah, you're still aiming for a richer title?
Perhaps we should promote you beyond gold.\nHow does Jewel Yam sound? Or perhaps, Garnet\nSweet Potato?
Hmmm. I've gotten so used to Russet,\nnothing else seems to fit quite as well.
I think it's best you remain Russet. But for\nyour efforts, I'll help you expand your\nterritory!
In fact, I'll do you one better.
After expanding this plot further...
I'd like us to start growing things other\nthan crops too.
We'll fill this place with nature, just like\nMusubi's hometown!
You'll help me, won't you?
I thought you'd say that!
I feel a strong bond between\nme and Yui...
Now that that's decided, let's get expanding!
Helmets on, Russet!
I logged out after blowing up\nsome mountains with Yui.
Seems like I can play it on\nthe game console in my room.\nMaybe I should try it out...
This is where I always do my shopping!
It's pretty small, but it has everything\nyou need.
So, any of the shops catch your eye?
Let's visit my favorite avatar shop, then!
That place's full of cute clothes!
Me? Well... how about that jeweler?
They sell loads of sparkly and dazzling\naccessories!
Oh, you don't look impressed. Not your cup\nof tea I'm guessing?
Yay! Off we go!
Don't knock it till you try it!
I'll pick out something perfect for you.
After that, we can go eat somewhere!
Hehehe, shopping with someone else is so fun!
Let the super fun shopping spree begin! Which\nstore shall we visit today?
Yui and I explored a nearby\ntown. We checked out\nthe avatar shop.
Yui and I explored a nearby\ntown. We shopped for\ninterior decor.
Yui and I explored a nearby\ntown. We looked around\nthe cyber produce shop.
Yui and I explored a nearby\ntown. We found a rare\ncyber fruit.
Yui and I explored a nearby\ntown. We stumbled upon a\nflea market at the square.
I'll show you around the snowfields today!
It snows here all year long!
That means you can try out winter sports like\nskiing and snowboarding.
You can even rent a snowmobile if you want!
So, what do you want to do now?
What a coincidence! I was just craving a\nlittle snow-racing adventure!
Let's go rent one now!
All righty then! Let's go rent some boards!
Then we'll get on the lift and make our way\nto the summit...
And from there, we'll shred our way down to\nthe bottom!
A snow fort? That's not a bad idea!
This cold weather is making me crave oranges.\nOh look, they're selling cyber mandarins\nover there!
We should go buy some!
Come on! Hurry up!
I slipped... Could you help me up?
No matter when you go, this place is always\na breathtaking silver snowscape! Now what\nshall we do today?
Yui and I explored the\nsnowfields. We tried out\nsome winter sports.
Yui and I explored the\nsnowfields. We made a\ngiant snowman together.
Yui and I explored the\nsnowfields. We went for a\nwild ride on a snowmobile.
Yui and I explored the\nsnowfields. After an intense\nsnowfight, we were exhausted.
Yui and I explored the\nsnowfields. Cyber buds were\nsprouting from the snow.
This town is far from the farm, so I don't\ncome here often, but...
You can find some pretty rare seeds here.
Hey, look at these! Cyber cauliflower seeds!
They have cyber horned melon and cyber\nartichoke seeds too!
Hmmm, as amazing as that sounds...
I don't think we can grow them on our farm.
We don't have the right climate for these\nto grow.
The area we're in now seems to be the perfect\nclimate for them, though.
Look. The sign says, "for advanced\nhorticulturists only."
We're really gonna have to put our backs into\nit at the farm if we wanna reach that level!
I have a great idea!
Let's expand our farm to this area someday!
Then we'll be able to grow the exotic seeds\nsold here!
Why, it's a wonderful idea if I do say so\nmyself!
C'mon, Russet, hurry up! I wanna check out\nthat store!
Yui and I visited a remote\ntown. We checked out\na newly-opened shop.
Yui and I visited a remote\ntown. We bought some new\ncyber veggies.
Yui and I visited a remote\ntown. We discussed a plan\nto expand the farm.
Yui and I visited a remote\ntown. We watched street\nperformers in the square.
Yui and I visited a remote\ntown. We participated in\nan event.
Today, I'll teach you how to operate the\nvehicles in this world!
Since you're new to all this, I rented a\nbeginner's vehicle for you!
It's this tractor!
It sure is! As they say, the bigger, the\nbetter!
I went to the rental shop and asked for the\nbiggest one they had!
Since it's a land vehicle, it's perfect for\nbeginners!
That means there's no risk of it crashing\nlike with a plane or a helicopter.
And you don't have to worry about getting\nbucked off like with a moody horse either!
All right. Practice makes perfect! Go ahead\nand give it a spin!
I'll teach you the basics of how to work it!
Don't worry. This place is nice and open.\nThere's absolutely nothing out here!
You've got no risk of crashing into anything!
That's it, you're getting the hang of it!
You're turning the wheel too much! No, not\nthis way! Watch out!
Are you ready, Russet? I'll make a tractor\nmaster outta you!
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. She praised me for\ngetting better.
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. I'm starting to get\nthe hang of it.
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. I managed to steer\nmy way to a neighboring area.
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. We chatted while she\nsat in the passenger's seat.
Yui taught me how to drive a\ntractor. We got a second one\nand drove together.
This farm is owned by the admin who manages\nthis world.
They've been recruiting volunteers to help\nharvest their crops, actually.
Since we're running a farm of our own, this\nis a great place to gain experience!
So, what are we waiting for!? Let's get\nfarming!
I love seeing you so motivated! Our farm sure\nhas a bright future ahead of it!
I'll be doing my best to keep up with you!\nHehehe!
About that, they'll share some of the crops\nwith us!
Let's take a bunch of them back!
By the way, I heard that the crops we'll be\nharvesting are cyber radishes.
We should compete to see who can\nharvest the most!
Watch me! I'm not going to lose!
I want you to start from this end of the row!
Oh! And no flying allowed!
Ready... Set... Go!
Our strength is needed! Russet, let's give\nvolunteering our all.
Yui and I volunteered at the\nadmin's farm. We harvested\ncyber carrots together.
Yui and I volunteered at the\nadmin's farm. We harvested\ncyber pumpkins together.
Yui and I volunteered at the\nadmin's farm. We hosed down\nthe crops together.
Yui and I volunteered at the\nadmin's farm. We fertilized\nthe field together.
Yui and I volunteered at the\nadmin's farm. We finished\nearly and went for a stroll.
I promised to invite Yui to\nmy virtual room...
It's completely, totally empty!
Do you know how to place objects in your\nroom? Why haven't you put anything here?
That's true, you and I have been hard at work\ncultivating our fields, haven't we, Russet?
But your room is just so gloomy with nothing\ninside!
Although it's not exactly correct to say\nthere's "nothing" here. I understand that.
Over here, you have that first-time login\nbonus given to every new player!
Ah, nothing else we can do! In that case...
I shall be your personal interior decorator,\nRusset!
Now that that's been decided...
We'll put a dining table right there, along\nwith two chairs.
And over here we can put some shelves with\nplants. I'll help you care for them, too!
Huh!? Wh-What are you saying?
I... I see your point. This sort of\nconversation does make us sound like a\ncouple of newlyweds...
Oh, Russet, you're such a kidder!
Apologies. I suppose I was pushing all of my\nown preferences onto you.
Just like with our farm, we should take both\nof our opinions into consideration.
This is going to be a fabulous room. I can't\nwait!
Just one more thing I have to look\nforward to!
I hope you'll invite me again soon!
I spent some time alone with\nYui in my virtual room... She\nseemed to be having fun.
This is exciting! I have so many ideas about\nwhat Russet and I can do with this room!
I spent some time with Yui in\nmy virtual room. We discussed\nour living preferences.
I started up the game console\nin my room...
I logged on to Virtual Produce Paradise.
Yui wasn't online\nafter all...
I fended off every last\npotato mole alone like\na true badass.
I dealt with the potato moles\nswiftly by myself. Looks like\nthe damage wasn't too bad.
I managed to keep the potato\nmoles at bay alone. Even had\ntime to fertilize the soil.
I'll have to defend our\nfields like this until Yui\ncomes back...
Looks like there's a pest\nproblem on the farmland...

Nothing's coming out.\nBad luck, I guess. Oh well...
Ahem! Just a moment please, young man!
Customers these days are so impatient...\nYou only stand to lose if you give up\nso quickly!
A talking vending machine?
Maybe it's AI...
Now, young man, is this what you were\npurchasing? Or, no, maybe this one?
The vending machine's\ndirectly talking to me...
My memory's just not what it used to be...\nCan't even recall when my son's getting home!
I'm sorry young man, could you remind me\nwhat it was you were buying?
Was it a limited edition Golden Drink?\nOr a regular Silver Drink?
*chuckle* What an honest young man you are!
I think that deserves a reward... You can\nhave a Gold Drink and a Silver Drink!
There's something suspicious\nabout those guys over there...
This is it! The lucky vending machine!
It'll spit out a ton of drinks for the price\nof one! If it doesn't work, just give it\na whack!
Great, let's give this a shot...
C'mon, hurry up!
Hey, what the hell? It's not even spitting\nout what I paid for! I want my money back!
Ugh, better get out of here! Dammit!\nWhat a waste of money!
It seems like it's sold out...
Ugh, I'm tired... So tired...\nEverything hurts...
Is he talking to the\nvending machine...?
They're making me work overtime and\nnot even paying me for it again...
Almost everything is sold out now anyway.\nWhy can't they just let me go home already?
Sounds like a tough gig...
My life is a failure... But I can't afford to\nlose this job...
My wife ran off with some guy I don't know,\nthe loans on our house aren't paid off yet...
And when I get home I'll probably get an\nearful from Mom for staying out late again...
Oh yeah, I wanted thank you for last time.\nHere, take this specialty drink.
I was going to have it instead of dinner\ntonight, but... I just want to get home now.
I didn't buy this one...
C'mon, fam, don't ask me how I am!\nYou know I'm great! Always first-rate!\nNo need to update!
Hey, that drink you've got there...
Oh man, I want that one. Can you trade\nwith me? Er, I mean, you don't have to\nif you don't wanna...
That's the drink I meant to buy, but the\nmachine gave me a different one.
But we don't have to trade or anything...\nAh, but... maybe I would like to...
I don't know... I've always had terrible\nluck, and I feel like my choices are\nalways wrong.
So I don't really trust my own judgment...
Bro, don't get stuck, we make our own luck!\nGive or take, no breaks without mistakes!
I hear something. It's coming\nfrom the vending machine...
Oh yeah, I head a rumor some vending\nmachines in Shibuya play rap music!
Those lyrics... It's like they're encouraging\nme not to be afraid of making mistakes.
Yeah, I can do this! That vending machine\nsold me some courage!
Get what I mean? I'm a simple machine!\nYou get wise, you get a prize! As advertised!
S-Spare, um... change?
Come unwind with a massage or one of our\nacupuncture treatments!
Welcome...
Kids aren't allowed in, so scram.
Woof! Woof! Hooray! Welcome to Shibuya!
I'm Shibuya's very own Shichi-kun!
Morning, noon, or night, Shibuya always\nshines bright!
Jugemu Jugemu Goko-no-Surikire\nKaijarisuigyo-no...
Hey there, Gen! How're you doin'? You don't\nlook so hot.
Might have a cold... Maybe I'll stop by your\nshop for some alcohol to kill these germs\noff.
Hahaha! A stiff drink can cure anythin'! But\nyou won't be able to taste the food with\na cold!
You're right about that. I'll come by when\nI'm feeling better then.
See you then! Now you take care of yourself,\nyou hear?
Ah, Fumi-chan. You headin' out?
Yes, I'm going to some sort of "dessert\nbuffet" with my grandchildren.
A buffet, eh? Look at you all hip and down\nwith the kids!
Well hey there, Yu-chan! How'd your boy's\nbig test go?
This "Taa-san" character's\nmaking small talk with\neveryone who passes by...
Hey there, pal! How's it goin'?
You're so young! Cheer up a little!\nA positive attitude is everythin'!
I've seen your face around here a lot lately.\nSo what's your name, pal?
{NAME2}? Now that's a good name! You should thank\nyour parents for that one.
I'm Tanzou. Around here I'm known for runnin'\nYakitori Tanzou.
You a yakitori fan, {NAME2}?
Yeah, ain't it the best? But y'know, my\nyakitori's extra special!
That's just because you've never had real\nyakitori before!
And you're in luck, because mine's the best\nthere is! One bite and you can tell\nthe difference!
It's so tasty you'll be clucking for more!\nThere's a sayin' about yakitori, y'know...
"It takes three years to master the skewer\nand a lifetime to master the grill."
Our tare recipe's been adapted over\ngenerations. And our salt skewers are just\nas good!
Tanzou seems intensely\npassionate about yakitori...
Oh, look at me ramblin' on!
In any case, if you ever have a hankerin' for\nyakitori, come on by!
I'll serve you somethin' so good it'll knock\nyour socks off!
Hey! Mos-san! That broken bone heal up yet?
Tanzou continues calling out\nto passersby...
He seems like a good-natured\nbusybody. I should talk to him\nagain some time.
The smell of grilled meat arouses desire.\nShall we find out where it's coming from?
One order of negima! Thanks for waiting!
It looks heavenly! Time to dig in.
Aaah... Nothing can beat eating yakitori\nafter school!
No contest! Plus, we've got the real\nyakitori here.
Oh, Tanzo's usual routine has begun! It must\nbe hard to become a first-class artisan\nlike him.
It's not just about the technique, though.\nAren't the ingredients just as important?
Of course!
Fresh chickens and hand-picked green onions.\nAnd a secret sauce passed down\nfor generations!
We slowly and carefully grill it\nover charcoal...
It's a simple job, but the finished product\nis entirely dependent on the skill\nof the chef.
I see. So all that attention to detail\nis why Tanzo-san's yakitori is so delicious!
But, it's a bit of a detour going from my place\n to Zoshigaya.
Tanzo-san, do you do offer yakitori delivery\nby chance?
If there was delivery, I'd go broke in\na week! I'd recommend it to my family, too!
I don't know... The setup seems like a\nbother... Plus, I'd have to hire a part-timer\nfor delivery.
I'll give it a little more thought,\nthen. Thanks!
Please do! If it actually works out, I'd be\nso happy!
Well then, how about one more? It's on\nthe house.
It's tempting, but I have dinner waiting at\nhome. I'll drop by again soon!
You'd think so, but...
I've been thinking...
...Welcome.
Oh, it's you.
Hey, do you know anything about online\ndelivery? Like making a food order from\nyour cell phone?
I see... It really is that popular...
It seemed like a hassle, so I've never done\nit. Been on my mind for a while, though...
For people for want yakitori but are too far\naway, we could deliver them real yakitori...
If we can pull this off, just imagine...\nYakitori delivery!
It's reassuring hearing it from you, too.\nWell then, I'm gonna get this started\nright away.
... What should I do first?
Truth is, I do have a smartphone, but I've\nnever even ordered delivery before.
You know anything about this type of thing?\nMaybe you could give it a look...
While looking at the delivery service's\nwebsite, I managed to get the basic\nsettings configured...
Ooh, you're already done? As reliable\nas always!
Hm? Not only do they want photos of the food,\nbut of the stand, too?
Oh man... Whenever someone asks me to\ntake pictures, they always come out blurry\nand awkward-looking.
Please! Could I ask you to take some for me?
I finished taking photos of\nthe stand. I should go \ntell Tanzo...
Thank you so much! I'll get these photos you\ntook keyed in, and...
There, now we just need to wait for orders!
Ooh, we got one in already!
It's for... a Yakitori Seven Set.
Yeah. I'm very grateful...
Still, ordering this quickly after we just\ngot set up? Maybe they're a regular. Or a\nhuge yakitori lover.
In any event, their desire for delicious\nyakitori is the same as it is here.
Let's get out there and deliver some\nreal yakitori.
The address is... An aparment in Yongen-Jaya.
Alright, I'll get it ready, and...
N-no! I forgot that I don't even have a\ndelivery person!
... Hey, kid. You free after this?
Okay... So you have plenty of time on your\nhands, huh?
Please, please help me with deliveries! I'll\npay you really well!
Then it's settled! From this day onward, your\nour delivery person!
Here's my phone number. If anything happens,\ncall me.
I'll get it ready now. Hold on just one sec.
Tanzo prepared the yakitori\nwith an effortless dexterity...
It's ready! Our very first delivery.
I'm counting on your delivery. The customer's\na waiting!
The address is an aparment in Yongen-Jaya.\nWatch out for cars!
This seems to be the\nright address...
Apartment 201... Looks like\nthe right place.
There's no response...
Do you need something from 201?
I think they're out at the moment.
We passed each other on the sidewalk just\na moment ago.
Around this time, the person who lives there\nusually goes for a walk around the neighborhood.
Maybe they forgot about their delivery and\nleft anyways? Maybe you can try calling them?
I dont have the customer's\nphone number...
I should check with Tanzo.
Hello? Everything all right? Did\nsomething happen?
I see! Let me see here... One second...
Sorry, I should be the one calling them,\nbut... The shop's way too busy. I'm counting\non you.
It sounds like Tanzo's busy\nwith the shop... I should call\nthe customer myself.
Yes, hello?
Ah! You've arrived already? That was quicker\nthan I thought...
I'm actually out on a walk right now.
I found some delicious yakitori online, so I\nordered it without even thinking.
Well, I ordered in advance because I thought\nit'd arrive just in time for me to get back.
Ah, but... It's also nice to eat yakitori\nwhile having a drink in the park...
Um... I'm really sorry about this, but could\nyou come meet me here?
I'm currently near the movie theater in\nYongen-Jaya.
Sorry for the extra work! I'll wait for\nyou here.
Something I can help... Oh? That package...\nAre you the delivery person?
Could this be the person who\nordered yakitori delivery?
Oh, I'm really sorry! It just slipped my mind\nwhile I was out...
That smells really good. I'm pretty peckish\nright now, too.
Sorry for making you come all the way here.\nYou really saved the day!
Haha, I feel so bad making you come here.\nSending you on a scavenger hunt to find me...
As expected, there are seven kinds of skewers\n packed in here.
Can I really eat this much in one sitting?
Hahaha, you're that confident, huh? I'm\nlooking forward to it even more now.
I've always had a soft spot for yakitori...
Unfortunately, I haven't found a go-to place\naround here yet.
Since there aren't any good ones around,\nI tried to look for delivery...
When I saw a new yakitori place delivering,\nI ordered right away.
Ah, sorry for taking up so much of your time.
I think I'll bring this to the park and enjoy\na nice drink with my skewers.
Welcome back! So, how did it go?
Alright! First order completed with no\nissues! Excellent work!
The customer left positive feedback, too.\n"I was moved by your thoughtful delivery."\nWhat a glowing review!
It feels pretty nice to receive a written\nmessage like this.
Until now, I thought that I shouldn't look\nat the faces of my customers, but...
With delivery, we can make even more\ncustomers happy!
Whether it's the stand or delivery, I'm\ngonna give it my all!
I'll be needing lots of your support here\non out. I'm counting on you!
Ah, and here's your pay. You're a lifesaver!
Yum!
A woman in a sweatshirt is\nlooking back and forth between\nthe street and her phone...
Um, hey! You over there!
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
I'm terrible with directions. Even if I use\nmy phone, I never end up where I need to be.
According to my phone's map,\nshe's going the opposite\ndirection of the station...
The complete opposite? You're kidding. How'd\nI get that turned around?
Anyway, thanks! You really helped me out.\nSee ya!
Looks like she's still not\ngoing the right way...
Huh? Ahaha... Oops.
If I let her go on her own,\nI don't think she'll ever find\nher way...
Oh, really? That'd be great. Thanks!
Wait... You mean you'll take me to the\nstation? Wow, that's so nice of you!
Sorry to be a pain. Please, lead the way!
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.
{NAME2}-kun? All right, I'll remember that!
Haha, the heck does that mean? Just tell me!
I eventually introduced\nmyself.
So I'm super into running, right? It's a\nhobby that takes me to different places all\nover the city.
Everyone else these days uses treadmills at\nthe gym, but I'm more of an outdoorsy type.
Going for a run under the sun just feels\nbetter, you know?
So which side are you on?
I see. Well at least you don't have to worry\nabout getting lost at the gym, right?
Considering how I am with directions,\nthat's a plus!
Ah, you get it! It's so much nicer,\nisn't it?
But you've seen how I am with directions.
I try to make sure to run around parks and\nstuff so I won't get lost.
But the same old scenery gets boring.\nSometimes I'll try a new location, and then\nof course...
I get lost! Just like I did today. Ahahaha!
Komatsu seems pretty\nlaid-back...
We made it!
Thanks a ton! Who knows how long I'd have\nbeen wandering around if it weren't for you?
I like running. Wandering aimlessly? Not so\nmuch! Ahaha!
Like I said before, I go running all over\nthe city.
If you ever see me around, don't hesitate\nto say hey!
I'm sure I'll probably get lost again like\nI did today...
In which case it'd be great if you could\nshow me the way. Anyway, later!
I had disregarded Inokashira Park as just\nanother mere strip of urban greenery, but it\nseems to be highly rated by the public.
There's also an aquarium, botanical garden,\nand a zoo, so people of any persuasion can\nenjoy themselves there.
If you have some time, why not see\nfor yourself?
I should try going to\nInokashira Park...
It's quiet and\npeaceful here...
Goal! And my time was... Alright, that's my\nnew record!
Oh, hey, {NAME2}-kun! You like coming to\nInokashira Park too?
Yeah, it's great here! It's one of my\nfavorite running spots too.
As long as I just circle the lake, I don't\nhave to worry about getting lost!
*grrrr...*
Urgh, all this running made me hungry...
Hey, want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?\nIt'll be my treat!
Come to think of it, the first time we ran\ninto each other was in Shimo-Kitazawa,\nwasn't it?
You're a high schooler, right? Is that where\nyour school is?
Right, that's the one! I've heard it's a\ngood school.
That area doesn't have too many cars, so\nit's a nice place to go running...
Ahaha! Sorry, I guess I'm always thinking\nabout running.
I've been training quite a while now, but\nof course I'm still nowhere near pro level.
Whenever I see a marathon runner, I can't\nhelp but think how cool they look.
Hmm... Well, there are plenty of marathon\nevents open to the general public.
But to me, it's not really about the\ncompetition aspect...
I guess I just want someone who will run\nwith me.
Yeah, same here! Whenever they have one\non TV, I never miss it.
But when I watch it, I guess I'm not\nthinking about wanting to be up there myself.
If anything, I just wish I had someone\nto run with.
By the way, are you into running, too?
Great! Actually, talking to you made me want\nto try running in Shimo-Kitazawa again.
If you're with me, I don't think I'll have\nto worry about getting lost...
How's that sound? After we eat, want to go\nout for a run together?
That's the spirit! Thanks so much, {NAME2}-kun.
Well then, let's meet in front of Kokatsu\nAcademy next time!
Hey, did you see that sporty-looking girl\nover there? She's kinda cool...
Yeah... I really like her style.
I got a whiff of something really good when\nshe passed by earlier! Like, citrus,\nor something...
Shhh! She'll hear you...
Oh, {NAME2}-kun! All done with classes?
That after-school feeling is the best, huh?\nMan, I kinda miss being in high school...
You'd better enjoy these days while\nthey last!
Okay, let's head out on the route we\nagreed on.
Oh, but first, we'd better do some warm-ups!
Start with some shoulder stretches...\nYep, that feels good!
Next we'll do lunges. Just watch what I do!
And finish it up with some leg lifts! How's\nthat? Feeling warmed up yet?
I'll be our rabbit for today. All you have\nto do is follow me.
"Rabbit" is something they say in\nlong-distance races. It's also called\na "pacemaker".
They're usually a more experienced athlete\nwho can set the pace for the rest of\nthe runners.
So as long as you've got a pacemaker,\neveryone can run with no worries.
All you've got to do is follow me! I'm sure\nyou'll make it to the end, no problem.
The most important thing when running\nis proper form!
Keep your back straight! Center of gravity\nforward!
Focus on your thighs and glutes, and use\nthat energy to push yourself ahead!
Got all that?
You're a natural at this, {NAME2}-kun!
Good work, keep up that pace! Let's go!
15 kilometers! We made it to our goal!
Better take some time to stretch and\ncool down.
It's important to prevent lactic acid from\nbuilding up in your muscles and\ncausing soreness.
Phew, that feels great! My whole body's\nrelaxed now.
So, how's it feel to have run 15 kilos?\nIt's a real sense of accomplishment, huh?
When you run, your brain releases hormones\nthat make you feel refreshed.
That's what we call a "runner's high".
Did you feel that today?
Glad to hear it. Oh, almost forgot! I always\npost on social media when I finish a run.
Let's take a photo to commemorate\ntoday's victory!
Yeah, that looks good. Should get some good\nbuzz! Now, what to write...
Okay, done! "15 km today! Ran like the wind\nin Shimokita!"
I'm sure I would've gotten lost if you hadn't\nbeen here. I'm glad you came along.
Well, I guess we should call it a day.\nSee you around, {NAME2}-kun!
*huff* *huff* Ugh... What do I do? Why does\nthis stuff always happen to me?
What if I can't find it? Oh god, they'll\nchew me out again for sure!
That man's acting suspicious.
Huh? Wha\u2014!? Ah!
Uhhh, no! Um...
I, um, tripped and then... Well, everything\nin my briefcase went flying all over the\nplace... *sniffle*
N-No, I didn't l-lose it, per se...
I just... dropped it. Yes, not lost,\ndropped.
You want me to describe it? Um...
It's a solid white USB drive, about\nthis big.
Whaaaat!? You'll help me find it...!?\nThat's so k-kind of you!
Well, I hate to impose, but thank you.
This USB seems to be what\nwe're looking for!
Ah! Th-That's it! That's my USB!
Ohhhh, what a relief...
I can't thank you enough!
This has company secrets in it. If they\nfound out I lost it, I'd be a goner!
Pretty sure he was a goner\nthe second he lost it...
Ah! I'm late! I have to go!
I can't say I was late because I lost\ncompany data, so I'll say it was for\npersonal reasons.
Anyway... Here. That's me.
I work at an office nearby. If you come here\noften, I'm sure we'll meet again.
I promise to repay your kindness next time.\nNow, sorry, if you'll excuse me, I should...
Huh? Waaaaagh!
Sato tripped over nothing,\nsending everything in his\nbriefcase flying again.
Will he be okay...?
Ah, {NAME2}-san. D-Did I make you\nworry about me?
I, um... seem to have lost my phone...
It should be somewhere around here. I've\nlooked everywhere, still no sign of it.
You see, I may have had one too many to\ndrink last night. My head's still spinning...
This is the spot where I took a tumble...
And now, I don't know where my phone is.
Ooh, ooh, did you hear!? Someone from the\nnext classroom over told me about this.
It's a puzzle challenge that's supposed to\nbe suuuper hard!
What's so hard about it?
They didn't know either! I wonder!
You get a stamp for each question you get\nright! And there's a prize for getting\nthem all!
Maybe the questions are really difficult?\nOr it's hard for some other reason...
Hey, Kyo-kun, Yuna-chan, doesn't it sound\ncool to you too!?
Hm... I guess it sounds kind of interesting?
With Nishimori here, the puzzles will be\neasy-peasy. What do we get if we win?
There's some kind of puzzle\nchallenge event happening\non Central Street...
Oh, would you like to try?
You can get a stamp sheet from the guy\nsitting over there.
All the rules are on the sheet, so be sure to\nread it, okay?
I decided to take\nthe challenge.
I decided to pass.
There's some kind of puzzle\nchallenge event happening\non Central Street.
Pick up your stamp cards over there.
The event rules are written on the cards,\nso check there before you ask me,\nthank you...
Huh? These questions are ridiculous.\nWhat's up with this?
Maybe answer randomly? You might still\nget a stamp.
Nah, I'm out. I'm sure the prize is nothing\nexciting anyway. Let's go.
There's a challenge question\nhere. It looks like a standard\nlogic puzzle.
You have to figure out which\ntwo out of seven suspects\nare lying.
No matter how many times\nI read it over, it doesn't\nadd up...
Is there even a right answer?
Haruna-chan, the next question's over here!
Whoa, I don't get this one at all!\nYou solve it, Nishimori!
Hmmm?
This puzzle's wrong!
It says there are two liars, but if that's\ntrue, then all their stories are\ncontradictory!
Contra...dictory?
We learned it at cram school, remember?\nIt means when things don't match up.
Huh? So there's no way to answer this one?
Let's go tell the staff! We've gotta let them\nknow their puzzle doesn't have an answer!
That girl's right. This puzzle\nisn't written correctly...
Oh, are you participating in the\npuzzle challenge?
I explained there was\na problem with the puzzle.
Oh, so that's what was up?
There were so many people who couldn't\nanswer it, I've just been giving them\nstamps anyway.
I decided to take the stamp\nand keep going.
That's not it!
We don't have the stamp from the diner,\nbut not because the puzzle was too hard!
Look, kid. If you don't have all the stamps,\nI can't give you the prize. Sorry.
But the question was written wrong!\nIt's unsolvable! That's why we don't have\nthe stamp!
I don't think so. These questions were\nwritten by adults, okay? And plenty of other\npeople got that stamp.
So no skipping. Just go back and try that\none again. Then you can get your prize.
But Haruna-chan's smarter than any grown-up.
Forget it. They're never gonna listen to us.\nLet's just go home.
Looks like those kids from\nearlier are having trouble\nwith the event staff...
Oh, did you finish the puzzle challenge?\nYou can pick up your prize here!
See here, kids? This guy was able to get\nthe stamp.
Right!? You saw it was unsolvable too!
Wait, huh? How did you get the stamp then?
I explained that the diner was\ngiving away stamps even if you\ncouldn't solve the puzzle.
What!? Seriously!?
Then there really is a problem with the puzzle?
I explained the problem with\nhow the puzzle was written.
Ahhh. So that's why so few people have\nfinished. Who wrote these questions anyway?
I'm sorry for not listening to you kids.
That's okay! I'm glad you get it now.
Can we still not get the prize? Do we need\nto go get the stamp?
No, no, you can have it! You have all the\nstamps except the diner after all.
We have plenty left anyway. You can have\none each.
Really!? Yay!
Isn't this great, Haruna-chan!?
And one for you too. It's a souvenir\nkeychain!
Oh right. Could I get your names? I'm\nsupposed to keep track of the winners.
I don't need your address or phone number\nor anything! Just your name.
I gave the staff my name.
Haruna Nishimori-san, and\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san. All right, got it.
Thanks for letting us know about the mistake\nwith that puzzle.
You're welcome!
I kind of thought the keychains would be\nbigger.
Come on, we're some of the only ones who\ngot them! These are super ultra rare!
And we got to find out why everyone thought\nthe puzzle challenge was so hard!
It's a good thing you were here.
I don't think they'd have ever listened to\njust us.
Thanks for your help!
Teeheehee!
Uh oh! I've gotta be home soon.
Ah, you're right! Me too!
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late already!
We'd better go then!
Haruna and her friends left...
There's some time left before your classes\nstart. Why don't we wait in the diner?
Aww, I don't wanna go to cram school...
What're you gonna do while we're at\ncram school, Haruna-chan?
I have a session with a college professor!\nWe're gonna talk about category theory!
So you're studying stuff we've never\nheard of again. Is that actually useful\nat all?
It might be! It's hard to say for sure\nright now.
But it's fun! Like solving a puzzle!\nThe professor told me that's a good way\nto think of it.
Remember that unsolvable puzzle from\nthe diner? It made me think of something...
It's the kids I met at the\npuzzle challenge event...
Who's this? Someone you know?
Remember the question from the puzzle\nchallenge that was wrong?
This is the person who helped us inform\nthe organizers!
He and Haruna-chan were the only ones who\nnoticed the problem with the puzzle!
Oh, I see. Are you a student?
I told her that I go to\nKokatsu Academy.
Oh, the one in Shimokita? So you're a\nhigh schooler.
High school!?
High school has classes like physics\nand literature and world history, right!?
What're you studying now!? You've got to\ntell me!
Don't you already study college stuff,\nNishimori?
Only math and English.
I'm sorry, she always gets like this when\nsomething piques her interest.
Haruna, let's head to the diner. Let's not\nkeep Yuna-chan and Kyo-kun waiting.
Whaaaaat!? But I wanna ask him about\nhigh school!
You'll tell me all about it, right? Right?\nRight!?
Pleeeaaase!
Yaaay!
Haruna... I'm really sorry about this.
I agreed to talk with Haruna.
Oh wow! I don't think I've ever seen a\nhigh school language arts textbook before!
It even has classical texts! Hey, can I look\nat this one too?
Haruna, don't make too much trouble for\nhim, okay?
I'm sorry. Tell me if she's becoming a\nnuisance, all right?
She's been a little bundle of curiosity ever\nsince she was small.
Oh, Kyo-kun, Yuna-chan! What do you\nwanna eat?
This must be Haruna's mother.
These two are Haruna's friends from school.\nTheir mothers and I are "mom friends."
We take turns watching the kids between\ntheir regular school and cram school classes.
We hang out outside of school too, though.\nLike the other day.
We're an Exploration Team! We investigate\nmysterious places around town and school!
That's how we found out about that puzzle\nchallenge!
Just stay away from anywhere dangerous,\nall right? I'm sure you all know that\nalready, but...
Hey Nishimori, can't we change our group\nname to something less kiddie-sounding\nalready?
No, we can't! Shota-kun picked that name\nfor us!
But Shota never plays with us anymore!
That's true, but...
High school math is all weird symbols.\nI can't tell what it's even supposed to mean.
Do you get this, Nishimori? Who am I kidding,\nthis must be a piece of cake for you!
If it's math, then yeah! High school math is\nso fun! It's just like solving a puzzle!
Then can you explain this?
Sure! You see, this means...
She solved the whole problem\nin her head...!
Haruna must be\nincredibly smart...
See? Haruna-chan's really good at math!
She meets with a college math professor\nevery week. She even discovered a new\ntheorem!
She's only in fourth grade, but she's already\nbeen accepted to a college in the US.
She wants to wait until after elementary\nschool, but they told us they'd welcome her\nany time!
Ooh, ooh! They told me their school is really\nbig! So big you can picnic in the yard!
Luckyyy. If I were as smart as that,\nmiddle school entrance exams would be\nnothin'.
But she has to learn super formal English\nso she can write essays and stuff.\nIt sounds tough.
It's not that bad! I have time to study while\nyou guys are at cram school anyway!
Hehe, thanks!
Thanks! I'll do my best!
Oh, right! Mom, do you have something to\nwrite with?
I do. What for? The usual?
Haruna started writing on\na large sheet of paper...
Done!
Here you go! It's a thank-you for helping us\nwith the puzzle challenge!
She likes to make her own puzzles and\ngive them to people.
She'd love for you to try it, if you\ndon't mind.
Looks like a part crossword,\npart matchstick puzzle...
It looks pretty difficult.\nSolving this won't be\nthat simple...!
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Can I see it, too!?
Ah, me too! I wanna see too!
Okay! But if you guys figure it out, you\ncan't tell him the answer, all right?
With plenty of trial and\nerror, the kids and I worked\nthrough the puzzle.
I solved it...!
Wow! Amazing! That's right!
Awww, I was about to get it too...
No way! I wasn't even close!
What'd you think?
I told Haruna I thought\nthe puzzle was hard, but\nvery interesting.
Really!? Hehehe!
Seems like everyone had fun with it!
Kyo-kun, Yuna-chan, your class starts soon.\nShould we get going?
And you have your lesson too, Haruna.\nBe polite to the professor, okay?
Coming!
Thank you for keeping us company. You really\nkept them entertained!
Thanks for playing with me!
If we ever meet again, let's play some more!
Yeah, me too!
Promise!
Okay, see you!
I said my goodbyes to Haruna\nand the others and left\nthe diner.
There aren't any tables for four open!\nWhat do we do?
Go straight to cram school? They might\nlet us use the private study rooms.
Ugh, I don't wanna go there...
Then should we go exploring? We won't go far.
As long as it's not too crowded! I can't let\nyou kids get lost around here.
Okay! Where do we wanna go then?
Oh, hello! It's nice to see you again.
Hey, are you doing anything right now?
We're going to explore Shibuya!
Oh, too bad... I wanted you to come explore\nwith us. See you around then!
You'll come with us, right, {NAME2}!?
Ooh, yeah! You should come too!
Please come! I don't wanna go to cram school!
Okay kids, don't hassle him too much, okay?
Maybe I'll play with them\nfor a bit...
I told the kids to be careful\nnot to wander out of Haruna's\nmom's sight.
Okay! We won't!
I'm sorry to bother you with this again...
So where are we gonna go? I want to see\nsomewhere new!
Why don't we let him decide? He probably\nknows more than we do.
Oh, that's a good idea! Okay, {NAME2}\ncan take the lead!
Exploration team, go!
I decided to go exploring\nwith Haruna and her friends.
I haven't been around here much before!
We don't usually take this train line.
I come here a lot running errands for my mom!
Do you come here a lot, {NAME2}?
Oh yeah? What for?
That makes sense! There are lots of shops\naround here!
Oh yeah! High schoolers can work part-time!\nWow, that sounds so fun!
Hey, so how late are these stores open?\nHow many people do you think work there?
What time do they start work in the morning?\nWhat do they do when things sell out?
Haruna's eyes are bright\nwith wonder. It's like she's\ndying to know.
I told her what I know about\nthe stores and how they get\ntheir stock.
Whoa! So that's how it works!?\nThat's so cool!
Hey, Haruna-chan, why do you think the\nfloor here has this kinda pattern?
Huh, I wonder why! Maybe there's some\nreason for it.
You know, I've seen floors with animal\nfootprint patterns on 'em before!
Ooh, where? I wanna see!
Yuna-chan, Kyo-kun! Don't go off too far!\nYou'll get lost!
I should make sure Haruna\nsticks with her mom.
Oh no...
I'll just stay late at cram school and study.\nDon't worry about dinner. I'll get something\nfrom the convenience store.
All right, if you're sure. Just don't push\nyourself too hard, okay?
It's Shota-kun!
Shota-kun!
Haruna!?
Oh, Haruna-chan! It's been so long!
It's been forever!
Who's that guy?
This is my friend, {NAME2}!
Oh, this is a friend I made recently. {NAME2}!
We're actually exploring right now!\nYuna-chan, Kyo-kun, and my mom are\nhere too!
Oh, really! You're all together then!
Hey, Shota-kun! Why don't you come explore\nwith us too?
I can't... I have to get to cram school.
Huh? You're going already?
He does this every day lately! He says he\nwants to go early so he can study alone.
Shota, why not go play with your friends?\nYour cram school teacher says your grades\nare good enough already.
Ooh, really!?
You're aiming for a school with super high\nstandards, right, Shota-kun? That's great!
Compared to you, it's barely anything.
Ah! There you are. Haruna!
Oh, is that Ito-san!? It's been so long!
Nice to see you again, Nishimori-san!\nHow have you been?
Where are you headed, Ito-kun? Shopping?
He's heading to cram school early.
Whoa, seriously? Are you in love with school\nor something? We never see you anymore.
He can't help that the school he's trying to\nget into has really high standards, right?
But the cram school teacher said his grades\nare already good enough to get in!
I'm gonna go. I've got studying to do.
Shota-kun! Wait!
Shota, wait, honey! Don't go off by yourself!
I'm sorry, Nishimori-san! Excuse us!
It seems like there's\nsomething going on here...
I asked Haruna if they\nhad a fight.
No... Nothing like that.
You know, the Exploration Team actually used\nto be just Haruna-chan and Ito-kun.
Kyo-kun and I joined when we started\nelementary school.
But ever since we found out Haruna-chan got\ninto college, Ito-kun stopped playing\nwith us.
Shota hates to lose. Maybe he's just jealous?
But he's never gonna be like Nishimori,\nno matter how much he studies.
I'm sure you'll be able to make up before\nyou graduate!
Hey, let's go back to exploring! We've still\ngot time before cram school.
That's right. Let's go, Haruna-chan.
Yeah... Okay!
Okay, {NAME2}! Where to next?
I explored Shibuya with\nHaruna and her friends.
Excuse me!
You're the guy who was with Haruna\nearlier, right?
I have a favor to ask. Do you have a minute?
There's something I want you to tell Haruna\nfor me.
Shota! Our table's ready!
Oh, okay... That's fine.
Who's this?
Haruna's friend, {NAME2}-san. He was\nwith everybody in Shibuya.
Oh, that's right! Did you need something?
There's something I want to tell Haruna, so I\nwas going to ask him to get the message\nto her.
I see... But why don't you just let me tell\nHaruna's mom whatever it is?
Because I can't!
I want to tell her directly, but...
I just can't.
He seems very troubled\nabout this...
Anyway, our table's ready, so why don't we\nhead inside?
{NAME2}-san... Do you think you could\nhelp him?
This is the first time in ages I've heard him\ntalk about something besides school.
I decided to listen to \nShota's troubles...
Shota has been friends with Haruna-chan\nsince kindergarten!
I have so many photos of them on my phone.\nLook how cute they were! Do you see?
Stop it, Mom.
Ahaha, sorry! But you two always got along\nso well!
You'd run around exploring, and sit around\nthe house together playing with your puzzles\nand riddle books.
Haruna-chan would figure things out so fast.\nYou were always frantic to keep up!
That's not how it went! I'd figure out how to\nsolve things first, then I'd teach Haruna.
Once she picked up the tricks, she got\nreally fast...
Ah, that's right. You did work out the\npuzzles faster in the beginning.
You're very good at school too, Shota...
But Haruna-chan's something else!
I heard she was already discussing math\nwith college professors in first grade.
I can't believe she's going to study at\na college in the US!
At least she'll be staying in Japan until she\nfinishes elementary school.
Hey, Mom, could you just...
Oh, I'm sorry! I've just been talking this\nwhole time.
You wanted to talk to {NAME2}-san\nafter all. How about I leave you be for\na bit?
I miss her too... I really do.
She's always been really smart. I don't hate\nher or resent her or anything.
But skipping over middle and high school to\ngo straight to college... It's too far away.
I'm not as smart as she is. I feel like if I\ndon't study, she's just going to keep getting\nfurther and further away from me.
I hate feeling like I'm being left behind.\nThat's why I don't have time to play.\nI need to study.
So, could you tell Haruna that I'm sorry I\ncan't play with her anymore?
"I'm sorry I can't play with you anymore."
That's all.
I'm not as smart as Haruna. I can't go off\nto college in America.
That's why I have to study now.
If I don't keep studying, I feel like she'll\njust get further and further away from me.
And I can't stand feeling like I'm being\nleft behind.
I understand how Shota\nfeels, but...
I'm not sure Haruna will be\nconvinced until she hears it\nfrom him...
I told Shota he should tell\nHaruna directly.
I'm telling you, I just can't.
When I try to look her in the eye and say\nI've got to study, I just panic and\nfreeze up, so\u2014
Shota-kun! {NAME2}!
Shota-kun, I saw your mom out front!\nShe said {NAME2} was here too!
You don't have cram school until later,\nright? I came up with a new puzzle!
Do you want to try it, Shota-kun? Maybe you\nand {NAME2} can try togeth\u2014
C-Cram school! Bye!
Shota-kun!? Wait!
Haruna, did something happen with Shota?\nI just saw him run out of the building.
I asked him to do a puzzle, and then he\nsaid he was going to cram school...
I guess he really doesn't like this stuff\nanymore... Puzzle stuff, or "me" stuff...
Don't worry! You postponed going to America\nto work things out with him, didn't you?
You have more than two years before you\ngraduate. I'm sure you'll make up by then!
But, if we can't...
It'll be my fault, won't it? All because I\ndecided to go to college...
I told Haruna about the\ncomplex feelings Shota's\nbeen grappling with.
So he doesn't hate me? Or puzzles?
I... still want to hang out with Shota-kun.
I want to learn about new things with him,\nand explore new places with him...
I want us to do puzzles, and challenges,\nand uncover lots of mysteries together!
Haruna and Shota both really\nmiss having fun together...
...Okay.
Mom, can I have something to write with?
I'm gonna make some puzzles for Shota-kun!\nReally good ones! Lots of 'em!
He'll like that, right...?
Then I'll do it! I'll try my best to make a\nton of really great puzzles for him!
Ooh, what kind of puzzles though? I wonder\nwhat Shota-kun would like best!
Oh! It should be like a treasure hunt!\nShota-kun's part of the Exploration Team\nafter all!
Maybe solving all the puzzles leads you to\nthe treasure? But where should we hide it?\nWhere do you think is good?
Haruna and I brainstormed\npuzzle ideas for Shota.
I said goodbye to Haruna and\nleft the diner.
Oh! It's {NAME2}!
Look! Look at this!
Oh... That's too bad. Next time then!
I finished the puzzles for Shota-kun!
You have to find the treasure by exploring\nShibuya and solving riddles!
They're all super tough, but I'm sure that\nwon't be a problem for Shota-kun!
Teeheehee! My mom said the same thing!
Shota-kun's cram school is closed today,\nand his mom agreed to help us!
She said she's gonna bring him to\nShibuya today!
But I wanted to ask you...
Can you give this to Shota-kun for me,\n{NAME2}?
I'd really like to give it to him myself, but\nI'm afraid he won't take it.
Oh, and you can solve the puzzles\nwith him too!
Except the last one. I made it so only\nShota-kun could know the answer.
I know he'll solve all of these for sure.
My mom's at the diner right now!
She's gonna call Shota-kun's mom and have\nher bring him here!
Ah, there he is!
I'll be waiting by the treasure! I'm sure\nShota-kun will find it!
Don't forget to give him the thing!
Uh, are you the one who wanted to see me?
My mom told me to come here for some\nreason, but...
Huh? What's this? Did you make this?
These are puzzles from Haruna...?
I can't.
There's no way I can solve puzzles this hard.
At first glance, it looks like\na simple geometry\npuzzle, but...
It's scary difficult. This is\nhard enough for a college\nentrance exam.
What's Haruna trying to do with this? Show\noff how smart she is?
Waiting? You mean she seriously thinks I\ncan solve these?
No, I don't. So, you're saying...
Haruna really thinks I can solve all these?
All right. I'll do it. If Haruna says I can\nsolve it, I'll solve it.
I hate being stuck on a puzzle so I'll solve\nit out no matter what.
Oh wait, there are hints here? This might not\nbe so hard then. Hm...
Shota's solving one puzzle\nafter another. The next\none is...
"Move three matchsticks to\ncomplete the crossword."
"Hint: A shop in Shibuya's\nunderground mall."
Haruna's really good at making this kind of\npuzzle, huh?
But I'm actually pretty good at them too.\nAnd with a hint, it's easy. The answer is...
Seems like Shota isn't\nany less quick-thinking\nthan Haruna...
All right, done! Now for the last one!
"Combine the first letter of each answer to\nfind the location of the treasure."\nThat's easy. It'd be...
In, front, of, the, first, bronze, statue...?
What is "first" supposed to mean? Was there\na bronze statue near the diner?
Maybe I got something wrong. Is there\na hint for this one?
The hint is "Exploration"...
It probably means in front of Buchiko.
Haruna!
Congrats! You did it! So you solved the last\nquestion, huh!?
Solved it? That one wasn't really a puzzle!
The plaza in front of Buchiko is just the\nfirst place we explored together.
You remembered!
Duh! Of course I did. I mean...
You're finally talking to me like normal!
When I heard you were going off to college\nin America, I panicked.
You're going so far away, when I just want\nto stay friends like this forever...
Yeah... I'm sorry.
I just like math a lot, and I'm good at it\ntoo! And that means I've gotta go far away...
But I didn't realize how much you hate\nlosing, Shota-kun.
The way I see it, no matter how far away\nI go, you're gonna catch up in the end.\nRight?
So I think we'll still be friends forever.
...Right.
And I'm not going to college until I finish\nelementary school anyway!
So there's loads of time for us to do stuff\ntogether before that, Shota-kun!
Looks like they managed to make up.
Hehehe!
{NAME2}! Thank you for everything!
Will you come play with us again sometime?
Yay, yay, yay! What should we do then!?
Huh!? You want to play another game already?
I've just been waiting here the whole time\nwhile you guys were having fun!\nI wanna play too!
Yeah, of course! We can all get together and\nhave a study party!
Oh right! Did you solve today's first\nquestion, {NAME2}?
I based it on a question from the national\nuniversity entrance exam!
What!? You made me do a college level\nmath problem?
You solved it though, right? So it's fine!
Oh, by the way, {NAME2}!
I've been spotting more mysterious stuff\nevery time I come to Shibuya!
Let's go exploring again!
I'm sure we'll find something really\ninteresting!
Huh!? Haruna! Wait!
C'mon! Hurry up!
You're part of the Exploration Team too now,\nright, {NAME2}?
I explored Shibuya with\nHaruna and Shota.
Students are chatting in\nfront of the Band Room...
I wonder if they're\nband members...?
Look, it's not like we're starting from zero.
We only need one more person, right?\nEverything will work out if we get one more.
I don't even know where to look. At this\nrate, I'm willing to take the next person\nwho walks by.
It's not like we're a karaoke club. It's hard\nto recruit members for a band.
We'll make it work! Just ask anyone who\nlooks like they've got nothing better to do...
Like that guy over there!
Hey! You look like you've got nothing better\nto do!
Wanna join the Band Club? We play music\ntogether!
Whoa, way too blunt. Plus, telling him he's\ngot nothing better to do? Rude!
I'm sorry, you must be surprised getting\nspoken to like that out of nowhere.
We're the Band Club, but we're short a\nmember, so we can't form a decent band.
It's ok if you have no experience playing\ninstruments. If you're interested, we'd love\nto have you.
I can join this club and\nstill participate in other\nclub activities...
Should I join the band club?
Really!? You'll join? The moment we started\nasking random people, we got a yes on the\nfirst try!?
Oh. That sucks, but it makes sense. It was\npretty sudden after all.
But if you ever change your mind, don't be\nshy. We'd love to have you.
There's no way we're going to recruit\nenough members like this.
Obviously. Our sales pitch sounds like a\nrip-off when you actually listen to it.
Hey, it's you again. Wanna join our band now?
Please join our club! We'd be super happy to have you!
Really!? You'll join? Thank you! Yes!\nThis is great!
I see... Well, I hope you reconsider.
We'll be waiting. Stop by whenever if you\nchange your mind.
And this is\u2014
Happy to have you, {NAME2}-kun.\nWe're short a bassist...
Have you ever played bass before,\n{NAME2}-kun?
No worries! Now let's get you signed up\nbefore you change your mind!
Uh, what she meant to say was, we'll\nget the papers ready and take them over\nto the faculty office.
I'm headin' into the club room then.\nGotta tell Taiko the good news!
First things first. Thank you for joining\nour club, {NAME2}-kun.
I'm the club's vice president. Since it's\nyour first day, I'll give you the rundown.
This is our club room.
We hold club activities here every day, so\nstop by whenever you feel like it.
You're still free to participate in other\nclubs too.
You the newbie Tsurumi talked about? You've\nnever touched a bass in your life, right?
Welcome, I guess.
Sorry if they sounded a little rude...\nI promise they're not usually like that.
Tsurumi and I've done band club together\nsince we started high school.
Taiko's played in a band since middle school,\nso she's pretty skilled.
She probably just feels uneasy about your\nlack of experience.
But everyone starts from zero, so don't take\nit personally. I'll cover for you where\nI can.
Mr. Higashino composes music. He's even\nwon awards.
Takanashi, don't talk me up like that.\nYou know how I break under pressure.
Well, we're here to have fun and take it\neasy. So don't push yourself too hard!
I met all the members of\nthe band club.
Just checking, but you don't own any\ninstruments, right?
Here, you can borrow the club's bass.\nFeel free to practice on it any time.
All right, let's have you practice playing\nnotes. First...
Hey, Ritsuka! Could you lend me a hand?
Okay, I'll be right there!
Okay, let's try this again...
Excuse me, Takanashi. I've got a favor\nto ask...
Sorry, this won't take long!
Phew... Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm happy everyone relies on me, but it's\nhard to keep it up all the time. Haha...
Yeah, but I'm the vice president, not some\nerrand girl. What a pain. Haha...
Not always, but Tsurumi and Mr. Higashino\ncome to me the moment they need something.
Even though I told them I'd be busy helping\nyou today.
Seems like things have calmed down now.\nOkay, let's teach you how to play.
Got an idea of how to play now?
Yes, that's the idea!
Let's try playing together. Don't worry,\nwe'll start with an easy song.
That was excellent! Is this really your\nfirst time?
I only joined band club in high school,\nbut I've played piano since I was little.
My mom studied piano at a music conservatory.\nWe had a piano at home, so naturally I\nlearned too.
I kept playing piano until middle school. But\nonce I started high school and went to the\nclub fair...
I saw the band club perform. All the members\nfrom back then have already graduated now.
Hearing them play, I thought, "I want to\nperform freely and full of joy the way\nthey do."
From that day on I decided to become a\nkeyboardist.
My mom seemed to be a little disappointed\nabout it though.
Ah, sorry for rambling on about myself.
I think you've got talent, {NAME2}-kun!\nDespite being a beginner, you play\nreally well.
Oh, it's getting late. Let's wrap up practice\nfor today.
See you later. Feel free to practice at your\nown pace. I'm just happy you joined.
I joined band practice.
I can use this time to\npractice solo or as a duo.
The drummer and guitarist\ndon't seem very into\nit though...
Sorry, I need to get some air.
Ah, I should go grab something to drink!
Good question... Seems like she's\nhaving trouble focusing.
She's fine. I think she's just worried about\nwhy Taiko's so antsy.
No, you're doing great, {NAME1}-kun.
I don't think that's what Taiko's worried\nabout.
Sorry to keep everyone waiting. Should we all\npractice together now?
Yeah! Let's do it!
Ah, oops!
Not your fault. My count was off. What a\nrookie mistake. My bad.
Today's just not my day. Sorry, Ritsuka, but\nI'm gonna head home early.
No worries. Mind if we chat a bit before\nyou go?
...Sure.
Tsurumi, {NAME1}-kun, you two practice on\nyour own for a bit.
Did you know Taiko was in\na band in middle school?
I heard they were good enough to work\nfreelance gigs.
They recently lost their current drummer,\nso apparently they asked Taiko to come back.
She turned them down at first, but she seems\nreally lost on what to do.
We barely have enough members for our club\nas it is, and we're small fries compared\nto them.
Ugh! I can't stop thinking about it. I can't\nfocus like this!
Damn! I just remembered my mom asked me\nto stop by the post office today!
It's about to close! I gotta go. Tell Ritsuka\nand the others I had an errand to run!
I'm all by myself now...
I'll practice more while\nI wait for Ritsuka to\ncome back.
Huh? Where's Tsurumi?
I told her she left to run\nan errand.
I see. Sorry for making you practice all\nby yourself.
Taiko is fine for now. I was able to find out\nwhat she's so hung up on...
She's not in the best mental space right now,\nso I let her go home early.
Her previous band inviting her\nto rejoin must be what's\nbothering her...
I told Ritsuka everything\nHorikita told me.
Ah, so you heard about it from Tsurumi.\nTaiko already refused the band's offer\nthough.
She's thinking she wants to stay with our\nclub and not go back to her old band.
It's just...
I want to confirm with you, {NAME1}-kun...
How do you feel about the club so far?\nNo bad experiences, surprises, or anything\nlike that, right?
Yeah, I can see that! You're improving at\nan impressive rate.
Huh!? Um, thanks! Well, I'm glad you're\nhaving fun.
But I don't think Taiko is... Hm...\nWhat should I do?
I got it!
Yes. As club vice president I have to lend\na hand!
Sorry for the yelling. That must have\nsurprised you.
You know when you think too hard and\neverything gets all jumbled up in your head?
When that happens, I find it helps to yell\nreal loud like a hard reset.
It helps me come up with a good solution.
So just leave the rest to me.
School's almost over, so let's stop practice\nfor today and clean up.
If you want, we can walk to the station\ntogether?
Ritsuka and I finished tidying\nthe club room and walked to\nthe station together.
There are lots of snacks\nlined up...
Wow! What's with all the snacks?
We still haven't had a welcome party for\n{NAME1}-kun yet, right?
I thought we could have a snack party\nduring our club time today.
I've gotten the chance to talk to\n{NAME1}-kun while teaching him bass, but\nyou two don't know him that well yet, right?
So, I thought now would be a great chance for\nyou guys to get to know him better.
I love it! Snack n' Chat Meet n' Greet!
Well, if it's a welcome party, then sure.
{NAME1}-kun, no objections, right?
Whoa! You're living by yourself now,\n{NAME1}-kun?
I thought you learned the new songs pretty\nfast, but you practiced at home too, huh?
Your owl pecks you when you miss a note?\nFor real? That's hilarious!
Smart owl. Sounds like a great coach!
I need to apologize, {NAME1}-kun.\nI misunderstood you this whole time.
I didn't trust a second year with no musical\nexperience suddenly joining our club.
But you seem like a good guy, {NAME1}-kun,\nand you didn't turn down Tsurumi's forceful\nrecruitment tactics either.
Hey! I wasn't that forceful!
Tsurumi, maybe let's just listen for a sec.
Considering the band couldn't exist without\nyou, it must've been hard to refuse.
For a year now, our goal as a club has been\nto perform in a competition.
If you weren't with us, {NAME1}-kun,\nwe would never be able to achieve our goal.
But Ritsuka and I should have told you\nbefore. It is an option to quit if you really\nwant to.
But after talking to you today...
I feel like you're really enjoying yourself\nas a member of our club, {NAME1}-kun.
You even practice at home, which means\nyou must be motivated!
At this rate, you'll be better than me!
But thank god! I was sure Taiko was gonna\ngo back to her old band...
Oh... Nah, that's not happening. Sure that\nband performs at a high level, but...
They only care about results. We never got\nto chow down on snacks and chat and stuff\nin that group, you know?
I don't think the high-pressure vibe\nsuits me.
Our club does revolve around having fun\nand relaxing.
Mr. Higashino discovered\nour snack party.
I wonder if he'll get mad\nat us...
How could you!? Starting the party without\nme!?
You said you'd be late today because of the\nstaff meeting...
Are any of my favorite marshmallows left?
The bag isn't even open yet!
Today's the welcome party for {NAME1}-kun,\nright? Welcome to the club! How are you \nfinding it? All settled in?
Ummm... We already did the whole "welcome,\nblah blah" thing.
Well darn!
Mr. Higashino joined in\non the fun.
Oh, Mr. Higashino, could you do the paperwork\nfor us to perform in the competition?
We have {NAME1}-kun now, so we have\nenough members to compete.
Oh yeah! That contest is super soon.\nThe High School Battle of the Bands!
It's just a small local competition, but it's\ngoing to be our first one ever.
Oh really? In that case, won't you need\nsome original music to perform?
Better to have something...
...than nothing.
But it's been so long since I've written\nmusic. Wonder if I've still got it in me...
You're part of the club too, Mr. Higashino.\nI want our band to debut with one of\nyour songs.
Okay! I understand.
It looks like Mr. Higashino's confined\nhimself to the prep room and\nstarted composing.
He always worried we'd never get the chance\nto debut in a competition when there were\nonly three of us.
Yeah, I'm really glad we did that. Taiko and\nTsurumi are on board now too.
Thanks for being so on board with this.
Sorry, everything was so perfect that I got a\nsudden surge of energy!
Oh, there it is. Ritsuka's famous,\n"I got it!"
Hey, Tsurumi and I were thinking that since\nwe're all here, we could play together once\nbefore heading home.
Sounds great! Care to join us, {NAME1}-kun?
Wow, we were totally in sync!
Again, welcome to the band, {NAME1}-kun.
Okay then, we're gonna head out. See you\nall tomorrow!
Hey, wanna walk back to the station together?
There's still so much I wanna talk to\nyou about.
I chatted with Ritsuka as we\nwalked to the station.
I arrived at band practice.
But I don't see Ritsuka\nanywhere...
Hey. Ritsuka's in the prep room.
She's helping Mr. Higashino compose music\nfor us.
{NAME1}-kun. You're here!
Right. Now that we're all here, let's do some\ngroup practice.
Good! Not bad at all!
With the rate we're going, I'd like to start\npracticing our competition song.
I think it will be ready soon...
It looks like it'll be a great song.
Yay! I can't wait!
Sorry I missed out on the first half of\nclub time.
Not at all. Mr. Higashino composes great\nmusic, so I'm excited to see what he comes\nup with.
Only thing is, he has a bit of an indecisive\nstreak.
I play the melodies he writes on\nmy keyboard...
He rewrites the melody after seeing how I\nperformed it, and we repeat that process.
But he can be a bit indecisive.
So I tell him that the song is turning out\nreally well to help push him forward.
I told you I studied piano before, right?
My mom is a professor at a music school,\nand a teacher there used to give me lessons.
That music teacher also taught me a bit\nabout composition.
They said if I want to be a musician like my\nmom, I should really learn how to compose.
But I've never released an original song I\ncomposed for the world to see.
I've only really scratched the surface.
But it makes me happy I can use my\nknowledge to support Mr. Higashino.
A skill I never thought I'd use turned out to\nbe helpful to the Band Club.
Not really... Like I said, I only learned a\nlittle tiny bit about composing.
I don't have the skills to create an entire\nsong on my own.
Well, I'm happy you feel that way, but...
Like I said, I only learned a little bit\nabout composing.
More importantly, I want to focus my skills\non performing well at the competition.
It's a small contest, but getting to have fun\nperforming with a nice band of friends...
...is the perfect goal for our club to have.
I get you! Aiming to be best in the country\nor whatever is just so not us.
If the band gets too serious and stops being\nfun, then what's the point, right!?
If anything, we should try not to get too\ninvested in the outcome of our first\ncompetition.
Okay, I'm almost done with the song! All\nthat's left are the finishing touches!
Wait... Takanashi, what time is it!?
Um... About thirty minutes till the school\nday ends.
Oh no! I forgot the vice principal wanted\nto meet with me!
Ah! Gotta hurry!
Please lock the club room on your way out!\nI gotta run!
Okay! Take care, Mr. Higashino.
Damn, he took the song with him. I really\nwanted to get a peek at it.
Well, he said he just needs to add the\nfinishing touches, so hopefully he'll show\nus next time.
Hopefully! Guess we'll have to wait till\nnext week. So exciting!
As long as he doesn't forget the song\nat home.
Haha... That happened last time...
Mr. Higashino is a good person, but he's\nkind of scatterbrained.
Oh! Remember that one time in class?
Mr. Higashino pulled a chocolate pretzel\nstick out of his bag thinking it was a pen!
Oh, do you think that might be from...
Yeah, he said he was "curious about the\nflavor" at our snack party.
Well, Mr. Higashino has come this far thanks\nto Ritsuka's support.
You're giving me too much credit.
No, I think she has a point.
We finished today's club\nactivities with a fun and\nrelaxed atmosphere.
We can start practicing for\nthe competition soon. I should\nkeep coming to rehearsal...
No, it's not here! Not anywhere!\nMr. Higashino, are you sure you lost it\nin the club room?
You didn't leave it at home?
I searched all over my house for it last\nnight, and I couldn't find it anywhere!
What about the faculty office?
Of course, I searched every corner there\ntoo, and still nothing.
I even looked in the prep room and it\nwasn't there either...
Oh, {NAME1}-kun, perfect timing! We need\nyour help!
Mr. Higashino lost the song he composed\nfor the competition!
I'm so ashamed of myself! I'm so sorry,\neveryone!
It's not here.
Let's take a break.
I'm sorry... everyone...
I haven't looked enough. I'll search my\nhouse one more time.
Oh! I should ask my housekeeper to look...
Didn't you say you already looked there\nyesterday?
Also, isn't your house a studio apartment?
Compared to that little space, it's more\nlikely lost somewhere in the school.
I can't believe you hire someone to clean\nyour tiny apartment.
*groan*
What should we do? Any ideas, {NAME1}-kun?
I thought about making one, but...
I lost it before I could.
I'm all analog...
I know that's rare these days.
Ugh, this sucks. The only copy exists in\nMr. Higashino's head...
Can you rewrite it from memory?
Uh, I guess I'll have to try... But I doubt\nit will match the original.
Some of the measures were hatched in sudden\nbursts of inspiration, so...
Ugh! And just when I finally had the perfect\nsong for everyone's contest debut!
Uhuhuh... Uwaaaaagh!
Wait, don't cry, Mr. Higashino!
Keep it together!
There's no way he can rewrite it in\nthis state...
What!? Sure I played it once to help him out,\nbut...
I did play it once, so there are some parts\nI remember, but...
It won't be perfect...
Mr. Higashino, wait right there!
You recreated the first page perfectly!
Amazing! I knew you could do it, Ritsuka.
Even though I was just helping with the\ncomposition, I managed to rewrite it.
I heard Mr. Higashino play it so many times,\nthere's no way I couldn't remember it.
Oh! Maybe if I heard you all play this...\nWe worked so hard on this song...
There's no way I can't remember the rest!
You students are working so hard. As your\nteacher, I can't be so irresponsible anymore.
I'm going to rewrite the song from memory\ntoday! Leave it to me!
I did it! A perfect copy!
I knew you could do it!
I'm going to make copies for everyone, and\nthen we can play!
Let's make up for the time we lost searching!
What a great song!
It's perfect for our band... Let's finally\nplay it together.
Everyone ready? {NAME1}-kun?
What'd you guys think?
We're far from perfect, but I think it could\nwin us the competition.
Win!? No way! That'd be awesome!
I didn't say we will win. I said we "could."
For real! We owe it all to her!
I mean\u2014! Of course Mr. Higashino worked\nreally hard too!
Not at all. Without Ritsuka's help,\nI would've thrown in the towel.
I only was able to pull it off because of\n{NAME1}-kun's encouragement.
Ritsuka, ever since {NAME1}-kun came along,\nyou've been a lot more optimistic.
Actually, not just Ritsuka, but all of us.\nThe whole club is more positive...\nCheerful even!
Oh yeah, I totally feel that!
Nah, you were like that before, Tsurumi.
Thank you for joining our club,\n{NAME1}-kun.
I know Taiko already said this, but...
I'm also really grateful you came along, {NAME1}-kun.
I kind of have a tendency to\noverthink things.
But you listen to me, {NAME1}-kun.
And you help push me forward.
Now I feel like I can tackle things without\nso much weight on my shoulders anymore.
Thanks to you I feel like I can go after\nthings I never thought I could handle before.
Yeah, for sure!
Hehe! I won't hold back.
We'll nail this contest!
The band club has united\nas one.
Let's keep up the hard work\nfor the competition!
Oohhh...
Welcome! Ah, I see that disastrous dinner\nhas already come to pass...
As long as the weather permits, you can find\nme doing fortune telling out here. Please\nstop by if you have the time!
Pardon me. I'd like to ask for directions...
Ah... I'm in a hurry.
Sorry for stopping you. Thank you anyway.
Do I look like I know, lady? I don't frickin' live here.
Oh, I see. Sorry to bother you.
Oh dear, this is no good. It should be in this area...
Why, thank you, young man. I'm a little lost and need directions.
I heard there's a sweets shop here that's popular with young people. Do you know it?
I saw it on the television... But I can't recall the name.
I opened the map on my phone\nand we looked for the\nshop together...
Over there! That's certainly the place. The shop is smaller than I imagined.
It looked much bigger on the television. No wonder I had such trouble finding it.
I would have been searching all day if you\nhadn't come around.
It's hard walking around that long at my age. How can I repay you?
Your offer of help was truly like rain in a drought.
When rain falls on the parched earth, it means salvation during a time of great need.
Sorry to use such poetic language. I meant that you helped me with my troubles.
I don't get many opportunities to converse with young people. I apologize if my mannerisms seem strange.
These words can't quite express the sincerity of my gratitude, but thank you. Thank you very much.
I left a bigger impact on her\nthan I thought...
I told her I'd be happy to\nhelp again if needed.
Oh my, you are such a kind young man! Thank you so very much.
I hope you'll allow me to treat you to tea as a token of my gratitude.
This shop's ice cream anmitsu is supposed to be delightful. Do you have time?
Wonderful! Shall we head inside? You can order whatever you'd like!
Fumiyo treated me to\nice cream anmitsu and tea.
...Oh.
You, over there! Buddy, pal, friend!

Hey there, buddy!
Your muscles are speaking to me... Come on,\nlet's listen to them together!
Hahaha, lemme show you around!
Your muscles will always be there for you!\nNever forget to speak with them!
Look at that lineup of machines, just waitin'\nto be used... Better than any amusement park\nor dreamworld any day, am I right?
What's that? "I wanna get training already"?\n"When can we lift those weights?"
Hahahaha! Even those pecs of yours can barely\ncontain their excitement!
Now then, the world is your oyster! Let's do\nwhatever your muscles want to do!
Hey, Anderson-san. You free after this?
We're going to a mixer, but a friend of ours\nhad to drop out. Wanna take his place?
Hmm... Sorry, but I've got a date with my\nlats and lumbar extensors today.
You talkin' to your muscles again? Still as\ndisciplined as ever, I see.
Hahaha, I had a feelin' you wouldn't be\njoinin'. Welp, we're all done here then.\nGood pump today!
The men left the gym...
I feel bad, but I'm the only one who can make\nmy muscles happy...
Be true to your muscles, my friend,\nand they'll absolutely respond in kind!
Hard work will always bear fruit...\nThat's right! A massive fruit we call gains!
So let's make your muscles melon-sized!\nWe're gonna target the whole body today.
Sorry, got a call...!
Hello, Anderson speaking! Oh that's right,\nwe spoke before...
No, of course not. I don't mind at all. I'm\nin the middle of something now, but we could\nmeet afterwards...
Okay! I'll see you at the square in front of\nShibuya Station then! I'll head right on over\nwhen I'm done.
Hahahaha! Looks like I'm gonna go meet up\nwith a lady by the station.
...Would you mind coming with me, friend?
I made a promise to some other muscles...\nThis lady came up to me the other day and\nsaid she wanted to try working out.
We exchanged contact info, and now she's in\nthe area and wants to meet up.
Hahaha... Well you see, I haven't had many\nchances to talk to women in my lifetime.
Maybe it's because I'm always listening to my\nmuscles, but women excuse themselves pretty\nsoon after we get to chatting.
Despite that... I still need to talk to her.
Her muscles were screaming so loud on the day\nI met her.
"Please help her!" they cried.
To think her muscles were feeling such\ndistress that only I could hear... I want to\nhelp her... and her muscles.
That's not to say I don't hope that it leads\nto romance, am I right!? Hahahaha!
That's why I want you to come with me,\neven if all you do is act as my spotter from\nsomewhere nearby!
But there's still some time before she\ngets there, so I'll give my lats that pump\nI promised them and head over.
You go ahead and wait for me at the\nstation square. Oh, hold on, I'll walk you\ndownstairs!
It would be great to have your help on this\nmission to save this lady's muscles!
Hey, friend! I'm glad you came. She's on her\nway here right now.
My heart is pounding so hard... But the heart\nis a muscle too, so it's like I'm getting\nanother workout in!
This time, you're gonna be my personal\ntrainer! Observe my cardiac muscle's\nheroic performance!
Hello, it's been a while... Do you still\nremember me?
Of course! It's great to see you again!\nAnd how have you been, little muscles?
Hahaha... I see you still have that thing\nfor muscles...
Oops, sorry... I forgot that talking directly\nto a woman's muscles can scare her off.
Oh, please don't slouch like that. It slows\ncirculation, which is bad for your muscles\nand can make you feel cold more often.
It seems Anderson is\nlike that with everyone...
Of course, the best thing for circulation is\nweight training! How about it? The gym is\nempty around this time.
I'm actually in the middle of my workday...\nBesides, I haven't had the time to work out\nlately even if I wanted to.
But... I wanted to at least talk to you since\nyou know so much about muscles.
Oh, you did? Well, there's no need to feel\nbad about taking some down time.
A healthy diet, work-life balance, and\nexercise will have your muscles singing\nin no time!
If something is holding you back, removing it\nis the first step toward good health!
Anderson seems to be very\nconcerned about this woman...
Whatever's bothering you, I don't mind\ngetting an ear workout in. I'll use my\nmuscles to help any way I can!
That's very kind of you. How about we do\nsomething when we're both free? Maybe even...\ngo on a date...?
A d-d-date!? You said date and not\ndeadlift, right?
R-Right. I'd be happy to! I'll find us a spot\nwith a protein-rich menu!
Protein...? S-Sure, that sounds good.\nOh, I have to get back to work now, but I'll\nbe in touch.
Anderson arranged a date with\nthe woman and saw her off...
I was so nervous I thought my heart would\nexplode! Look, my muscles are all pumped up!
I probably would've tapped out if I were all\nalone... It was so encouraging knowing you\nwere by my side!
Her muscles seemed pretty grateful when I\nagreed to go out with her.
I want to relieve her stress and make her\nmuscles bigger, healthier, and happier.
But unfortunately, I have no experience going\non dates with women... Do you have any good\ntips, friend?
Way to go, friend! That's it! I'll find a\ntranquil place where I can help solve\nher problems!
Somewhere we could get some steps in would be\ngood too... Hmm, around Zoshigaya might do\nthe trick.
Huh...? Your muscles are trying to tell me\nsomething... Are you familiar with Zoshigaya?
Hahahaha! This must be fate then. You're like an\nopen squat rack after 5 PM!
Okay, friend! Let's plan a walking date\ncourse together that will really work\nher muscles!
Looking forward to seeing those guns of yours\nagain in Zoshigaya!
I helped plan the course with\nAnderson. He seems like he's\ngoing to ask her right away...
Hey, friend! She's on her way here right now.
This is the walking course we came up with.\nMy muscles are confident it'll be a success!
Thanks! It's bound to go well! Just watch\nmy form, friend!
*sigh* Isn't walking great? I can feel the\nblood flowing all the way to my fingers\nand toes.
R-Right... Even a simple walk... can be good\nfor your health.
Thank you... very much for introducing me...\nto such a wonderful route...
I worked with a friend to come up with it.\nWalking is one of the best exercises for\nyour muscles!
Really...? Thank you for... putting in\nso much effort...
Now that we've warmed up our muscles...\ncan you tell me what's troubling you?
The woman tensed up...
I-I'm sorry... I... umm...
Don't be shy. It's clear your muscles have\nwanted to tell me something for a while now.
The woman looks absolutely\nterrified by what Anderson\njust said...
Oh, it's not what you think. I just overheard\nthe voice of your muscles, and...
Sorry... I just wanted to give you a ripped\nshoulder to lean on... How about we take\na break somewhere to\u2014
N-No... I should be the one who's sorry!\nI only approached you... to swindle you!
Swindle... me? What do you mean?
I-I work for a company that sells expensive\nhealth equipment at horrendous prices.
I see... Go on.
You happened to catch my boss's eye,\nso he told me to make you sign a contract.
I don't really have a choice... He docks\nmy wages if I can't get a signature...
But I can't bear to keep deceiving people\nlike this anymore, so I asked to be\ntransferred to another position.
And he promised me he would if I could get\none last contract...
And that would be with you. But you've been\nso kind to me, I can't do this...
I'm so sorry. I... I really don't know what\nto do...
Anderson seems deep\nin thought...
How about this? I'll sign the contract\nas you originally planned. That'll fix\neverything!
Hey there, friend!
If you ever want to talk muscles with me,\ncome by any time!
The best way to listen to your muscles is to\nwork out. I'll always be waiting here!
They'll do anything for me if it makes me\nhappy. Why am I being criticized?
Hey, friend! Did you hear? I helped her\nclose her final contract!
That should boost the health of her muscles\ndramatically. Problem solved!
Hahahaha! You underestimate me, friend.\nDon't you worry!
I'd been saving up to buy a new machine.\nIf I raid my savings, I'm sure I can make\nit work.
And besides, I could tell her muscles were\nso grateful to me as we were leaving.
"Thank you," they said. "You were a huge help."
Muscles tell it like it is! The moment I\noffered to help, I heard them finally relax!
If she was lying, her muscles would be\ncackling up a storm, not feeling relieved.
She wasn't lying, I'd bet my muscles on it.\nDon't you think that's enough?
Oh, don't tell me you're worried about me.\n...That's very kind of you, friend.
But there's no need, because I have you as\nmy wonderful personal trainer by my side!
Oh, it's almost time for work and I just took\nout a big loan, so I need to get fired up.
Oh? Is this hers!?
What the heck? I can't believe I didn't\nnotice she dropped this!
Sorry, but could you deliver it for me?\nThis must be important to her.
Her company's near the movie theater in\nShibuya. She said she was going to meet\nher boss.
I'll message her as well. I'm counting on\nyou, friend!
I received the woman's lost\nproperty from Anderson.
Her company is near the movie\ntheater in Shibuya. I should\ngo pay it a visit...
I found the woman who sold\nAnderson the overpriced\nfitness equipment...
That man standing next to\nher must be her boss.
But something's not right...\nIt looks like she's pleading\nto him with tears in her eyes.
Bwahahaha! Even his brain is dense like a\nmuscle! See? It went just as I said it would.
U-Um, sir... I got that last contract as\npromised, so...
You're going to transfer me to another\ndepartment now, right?
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, I can't hear you\nwhen you mumble like that... Hey, your phone\nkeeps goin' off. You gonna check it?
It's... They're messages from that man...\nA-Anderson-san...
Hahaha! So you ignore 'em as soon as they\nsign, huh!? You really are perfect for our\nsales team! Keep up the good work!
I thought this would be the last time, so I\neven got him to take out a loan for it...
I'm gonna head back to grab my stuff. And you\ncan get to work finding us another sucker.\nMaybe an old lady this time.
Ahaha, hold up! Your mascara's running!\nThat's hilarious! Can I take a video?
Now both her and Anderson\nhave been fooled... I need to\ntalk to that woman.
They both went into a building\nnear the movie theater.\nThat must be the office...
I decided to wait for\nthe woman to come\nback out of the office...
The wisest course of action for us right now\nwould be to enter the Mementos. Let's go.
That's Ogiwara's Shadow...
Wanting to be loved is human nature!
And the more I dress myself up,\nthe more I'll be loved!
I don't care if people lie to me, mock me,\ninsult me, stalk me, whatever!
Love is an instinct. Everyone is trying to do\nthe same thing as I am, anyway!
I suppose she has a talent for rationalizing\nher desires, if nothing else. Now let's\nfinish this.
Everyone came to me of their own free will!\nWhy am I the one being condemned, now?
My heart was played with so many times...
They'd claim to love me, but as soon as\nI took them seriously, they'd have a new\nfavorite!
I didn't want to be the one getting hurt\nanymore, so I decided to hurt them first.
All I wanted was real love. But I guess\nmy heart became twisted along the way...
I just want love! Why does nobody understand?
Beauty may betray you, but muscles never lie!\nJust put in the work and you get the results!
Don't you think so, friend?
Yes, yes, I knew you'd agree!
Your muscles seem delighted. You must be\ngetting in some good workouts!
I mean, just look at them! The firmness,\nthe sheen, the definition of these muscles...\nIs that not the ultimate result?
Hmm? What's wrong? Is there something you\nwant to talk about?
Hmm? Oh that. We terminated the contract for\nthe training equipment, no prob.
She called me later, actually. Said she used\na cooling-off period to cancel it without\ntelling her boss.
Apparently, she's quitting her job and going\nback to her hometown. A wise move by the\nsound of it.
Speaking of which, I decided to confess my\nfeelings to her since it was probably my\nlast chance...
She rejected me unfortunately. Hahahaha!
But she promised to contact me again when\nthings settle down. That's good enough for\nnow!
While talking to her, I could almost hear the\njoy of her muscles through the phone.
"Thank you for setting her free!"\n"Now we can finally be healthy!" they said...
She told me too how grateful she was.\nShe sounded so full of life...
While this venture didn't lead to romance, I feel refreshed... Like after a really good workout.
There's something almost\njoyful about the way his\nmuscles are pumping...
Hahahaha! It looks like you could hear\nthem, too!
Great! I'd expect nothing less from my\nfriend! Your ear muscles are\ngetting stronger!
Now that we've saved some lost muscles,\nlet's get back to training our own today!
We'll talk to our muscles, grow them, and\nhelp them thrive, like true workout partners!
I'll always be waiting for you here, friend!
W-Wait! You promised to transfer me if I got\nyou one last signature!
You've gotta be kiddin' me! Whaddaya mean\nyou lost the contract!?
I-I must have dropped it somewhere...!\nI'm so, so sorry...!
Um, can I help you?
That's the contract I lost! Th-Thank you\nso much for bringing it to me!
Ugh, you've wasted so much of my time.\nTch, I'm goin' home. We're done here.
Um... Could I talk to you for a second?
So you know everything, huh...? Turns out\nI was the one being swindled.
What you brought to me earlier was\nAnderson-san's contract.
But without it, we could've voided the deal.\nWhy would he give this back to me?
...You're right. He's been nothing but kind\nto me from the first time we spoke.
But I made him take out an expensive loan and\npushed him to buy things he doesn't need.
I really thought this would be the last time,\nbut nothing changed... I feel so stupid.
To tell the truth, I was planning to just\ntrick him normally back in Zoshigaya...
But I struggle with big men. They scare me.\nSo I ended up confessing everything instead.
I didn't do it because I felt guilty or\nanything. And that's why I feel so bad\nabout it now...
Did he say anything to you after we parted\nways in Zoshigaya?
...I see.
I've had a pretty unhealthy lifestyle since I\ngot this job. I haven't had the time to take\ncare of myself.
But he was... truly worried about me.
You're right... I'm sorry for making you\nlisten to all my silly problems.
That voice inside me, the screams from my\nmuscles... My body was trying to tell me what\nto do, but I couldn't hear any of it.
But now I understand. And it's all thanks\nto Anderson-san.
I'll do everything in my power to cancel\nAnderson-san's contract!
It should work out if we treat it as a\ncooling-off period... And the loan probably\nhasn't even been processed yet.
Ah... But what should I do after that?\nMy boss will be so angry with me!
U-Um...! What do you think I should do...?
I gave the woman a lot\nof advice, including what\nto do about Anderson...
Hey there! You're lookin' fit today!
What's that? You wanna get even bigger?\nHahaha, there's no stoppin' you, is there!?
...Is he talking to me?
What's that I hear? "Please train me!"?\n"I can grow even stronger!"?
Hahahaha! I haven't met muscles this\nmotivated in ages!
Oh, sorry! Guess I oughta introduce myself\nto the muscles' owner too, huh?
No no no! I'm not gonna make you sign up\nfor anythin'!
That's great! But don't worry, I'm not tryin'\nto recruit you or nothin'.
I stand here every day, listening to the\nmuscles of the people walkin' by.
But I can hear your muscles shoutin' louder\nthan any others! They're screamin' out to\nbe trained!
Ah, sorry! I can tell you're still pretty\nconfused...
Well, you see, workin' on my body taught me\nhow to listen to my muscles.
My biceps cryin' out for me to "Get that pump!"\nMy abs beggin' me to "Turn that six-pack to an eight-pack!"
I listened to their pleas and trained my body\nevery day into the specimen that stands\nbefore you.
And wouldn't you know! Now I can hear other\npeople's muscles too!
I think all the work I put in at the gym built up my ear muscles too.
Somehow, I doubt that...
But! These days I've been hearin' people's muscles less and less.
Everybody's lackin' spirit. And that means, their muscles are bein' neglected!
But then I heard the mighty voice of powerful muscles screamin' out to be heard...
They were your muscles! They're beggin' to be expertly trained!
Oh right. I haven't even asked you what your\nname is yet, have I?
{PLAYER_NAME}... That's got a nice ring\nto it. I bet "Gains" is your middle name!
Boy, you're a shy one, huh? Should I call you\nJohn Doe?
No need to be so cautious. I just wanna be\nfriends!
Okay! We're friends now!
And what do friends do together?\n...That's right!
They train together!
What's wrong? No need to be scared! We can train whenever you feel like it.
I usually hang around here when I'm free,\nso gimme a shout sometime.
We'll talk to our muscles, build 'em up,\nand help them thrive, like true workout partners!
I'll be waitin' for you, friend!
I can't tell where he's\nlooking with those\nsunglasses on...
I must be mistaken...
What's that? I hear some big muscles cryin' out over here, too...
I became training buddies\nwith Anderson.
Hmm, this isn't good... What should I do?
Meow?
Hello. By any chance, do you live\naround here?
Ah, nice to meet you. Are you one of this\norange tabby's friends too?
Meow!
I see, I see. He seems to be fond of you\nas well.
It seems like this man can\nunderstand what the cat\nis saying...
Meow meow, mew-mew!
Oh, I don't have any such special skills.
But this orange tabby is quite different\nfrom the other neighborhood cats.
Meow? ...Meow, meooow!
Hmm, I see, I see...
He says it's still too early for you to\nunderstand what he's saying.
Don't worry. As long as you are patient\nwith him, you will come to understand him\nnaturally.
Meooow meow! Meow meow.
Huh? You wish to tell him about that...?
I mean, that would certainly be of great help\nto me, but...
If you don't mind, could we ask you for\nyour help?
You see, the orange tabby seems to be\nsearching for something.
Before arriving in Zoshigaya, it seems he\nwandered about from town to town...
He apparently has a habit of hiding\n"treasures" around his territory.
And now his treasures are hidden all\naround Tokyo.
Although there are just so many of them,\nhe's forgotten where he hid them all.
Meow...
So he asked me to help him look for\nhis treasures.
But as you can see, I'm getting on in years.\nI'm in no shape to be running all over Tokyo\nthese days.
When I heard the orange tabby's plight,\nI wished I could help, but it's just\nso difficult...
Meow, meow!
Ah, he's right. First, let's show you one\nof them.
This way. Just follow me.
Meow.
I followed the old man...
Here. This is it.
Meooow!
Things like this are hidden all around Tokyo.
What do you say? Will you help find the\norange tabby's treasures for me?
The orange tabby seems to think you'll be up\nto the task.
Now, now. He may a cat, but he's got a\nremarkably good eye for people.
Would you be so kind as to help an old\nman out?
Meow, meow meow!
Thank you. You've helped me out as well.
Please take this treasure with you, so you\ncan remember what to look for.
However... you must never look inside.
Well... I'm afraid it's not for me to say.
Once you have learned to understand the\norange tabby, you may ask him directly.
Now, to begin, he'd like you to find the six\nremaining treasures hidden here in Zoshigaya.
I know it would be troublesome to suddenly\nask you to go to another town to search\nfor treasure.
It's the tabby's treasure...
Is there a treasure in there?
Hey... You don't actually intend to dig\naround in a garbage can, do you?
I was able to retrieve the\norange tabby's treasure from\ninside the trash can...
As a matter of fact, I'm also looking for\nsomething I dropped... Haha, but don't\nmind me!
My flowers don't seem to be growing well...\nIf only I had that extra-strength\nnutrient fertilizer...
Eh? What? Did you need something?
Ah, thank you! This will certainly help my\npoor flowers.
Here, you can have this if you want. I found\nit hidden in my planters.
Well, it appears you found all of the orange\ntabby's treasures hidden in Zoshigaya!
He seems quite happy as well, as you can see.\nYou did an excellent job.
Haha! It seems the orange tabby was right\nabout you after all.
Now then, I hope you'll help us find the\ntreasures in the next town as well.
There are many more towns where the orange\ntabby has hidden his treasures.
When you've found all of them in each town,\nplease bring them back to him.
He'd like you to check Yongen-Jaya next.
Of course. The orange tabby has wandered far\nand wide across all of Tokyo.
Well then, once you're ready for the next\ntreasure hunt, please let the tabby know.
Meow-meow meooow!
Thanks for your help. We hope to hear from\nyou soon.
Hmm, I see. I understand what you're saying.
Perhaps I should buy some extra-strength\nfertilizer... But it may be out of my budget\nfor this month...
There's one on display...
There's a treasure\nhidden here...
I found a treasure...
I used the extra-strength\nnutrients on the potted\nplants...
I think they sell extra-strength\nnutrients at the flower shop\nin the underground mall...
Meow, meow, meow-meooow...
I have no idea what he's\ntrying to say...
Maybe he wants me\nto follow him?
Me-ooow!
That's the way to\nYongen-Jaya... Guess I should\nhead over there.
Oh? What a coincidence, meeting you here!
And you're with the orange tabby... How\nis that?
Meow, meooow!
Meow, meow. Meooow!
Hm. I see, I see...
You've come to look for the orange tabby's\ntreasures?
Meow... Meow meow meow meow.
As he said, there are six treasures hidden\nin Yongen-Jaya.
This neighborhood is a maze of narrow\nalleyways, so it might be a more difficult\nsearch than Zoshigaya.
He says he is sorry for giving you such a\ntroublesome task.
But he wants you to know that he truly can't\nremember where he hid any of them.
So he hopes that you will be able to help him\nrecover them.
I'll be cheering you on from the sidelines\nas well.
Such a narrow little space! How on Earth did\nthat cat hide it in there?
I reach as far as I can behind\nthe vending machine...
Yes, got it!
Hey... Are you digging through garbage again?
You've certainly become an accomplished\ndumpster diver.
What's that doing here...?
We were just about to get the treasure,\nand now this stray cat is here... Seems like\nit's hungry.
Maybe the supermarket has\nsomething for a cat to eat...
It seems to really want this\ncat food...
That seems to be its way of thanking you for\nthe cat food. In that case, we humbly accept.
I finally found it...
Oh! It looks like you've found all of the\nhidden treasures in Yongen-Jaya.
It seems the orange tabby's trust in you was\nnot misplaced.
Congratulations. Well done.
Meow meow!
You've got a real talent for finding lost\ntreasure. As long as it's for cats,\nI suppose...
Protein...? S-Sure, that sounds good. Oh, I\nhave to get back to work now, but I'll\nbe in touch.
I hope we can continue to count on your help\nin finding the orange tabby's treasure.
There is still more hidden in other parts of\nthe city.
Indeed. If it's not too much trouble for\nyou, could we exchange contact information?
I exchanged numbers with the\nold man...
Well then, I'll see you on the next treasure\nhunt. I'm looking forward to it.
The orange tabby isn't in his\nusual spot...
Ah, it's you. Perfect timing.
Actually, I was just thinking I should give\nyou a call.
I know. The orange tabby isn't there, is he?
That's actually what I wanted to call\nyou about.
I'm afraid I have some business to take care\nof, so I don't think I'll be able to get over\nthere anytime soon...
That's why I at least wanted to pass on the\norange tabby's message to you.
The orange tabby is waiting for you in\nShinjuku. I'd appreciate it if you could\ngo there.
You've really helped out the orange tabby.\nWell then, until next time.
The orange tabby is in\nShinjuku... I should go there.
Meow meow, meow!
Meooow...
I still don't know what\nhe's saying...
What are you doing? This conversation isn't\ngoing anywhere.
What a preposterous question. I'm obviously\nnot a cat.
No, of course not...
I might have to give the\nold man another call...
Oh, have you already arrived in Shinjuku?
It sounds like you were able to meet up with\nthe orange tabby. That's good to hear.
Meow, meow meow. Meow-meow!
Precisely. As he just said, there are seven\ntreasures hidden in Shinjuku.
Well, I suppose you're familiar with this by\nnow. As always, we'd appreciate your help\nfinding them.
There's no use trying to stop you... Let's\njust get this over with.
I can't get it out of this\nmountain of garbage...
I should just clean up\nthe trash...
Finally, I've found\nthe treasure.
Are you looking for something? Was it this?
I assumed a customer must have lost it, so\nI left it out in an easy-to-find spot.
But I was curious what's in this\nlittle bag...
...Mind if I take a peek inside?
I see... Well, don't worry about it.
So that's where it was...
One of the orange tabby's\ntreasures is among the samples\nat the store...
I explained the situation and\nthe store clerk let me\ntake it.
Hello there. Did you need something?
Ah, I see the orange tabby is with you.
I'm unfortunately still preoccupied at the\nmoment, so I won't be able to meet with\nyou directly...
I see, so you were able to find all the\ntreasures for him again.
This place has many more people passing\nthrough than Zoshigaya or Yongen-Jaya,\ndoesn't it?
So in order to avoid any unwanted attention,\nit's only natural that they would need to be\nhidden more carefully.
Hm? I see, yes...
While you were out looking for treasure, you\n didn't happen to see a calico cat, did you?
One of the orange tabby's friends is around\nhere. He says she's a calico.
Apparently this friend took care of him\nwhile he was living in this part of the city.
Since he came all the way here, the orange\ntabby seems eager to see her again...
Mew...
Mew mew...
Hm? That meowing... Could that be the orange\ntabby's friend?
Meeew. Mew mew mew...
Hahaha. She says she appreciates you taking\ncare of the orange tabby for her.
To think he was really able to see her\nagain... Luck seems to be on your side,\nyoung man.
On behalf of his friend as well, I hope\nyou'll continue helping with his requests.
So then, I look forward to the next\ntreasure hunt.
Hahaha, I'm sorry I could only help you\nover the phone this time.
Thanks for your help today.\nWell then, see you next time.
Meow? Meow!
I explained the situation and\nthe store clerk let me\ntake the treasure.
It seems like the cat has\nsomething to tell me...
Meooow.
I've been seeing that little guy around\nhere a lot lately...
There's a rescue group in this neighborhood\nthat looks after stray cats, so that must be\nwhy he feels so comfortable here.
So if you see that orange tabby around,\nmake sure to be nice, okay?
Maybe the rescue group is\ntaking care of that cat...
Lately, I've seen the orange\ntabby hunting around for food\nor something, I think...
He might still be nearby.\nI should look around\nfor him...
Ah, it's the orange tabby! Are you hungry?
There, there, good boy. I've got some\nleftovers you could have. That sound good?
Hahaha, okay! I'll bring them right out\nfor you.
Oh! It's the orange tabby!
Hello there, orange tabby! How have you been?
Oh, I'm glad to hear so! Ah, so cute...
He's not scared of dogs at all. That's\npretty amazing for a cat!
The orange tabby seems\nto be very popular...
Bye-bye!
What's he doing at my house?
Maybe he noticed I was\nfollowing him, and led\nme here...
Meowww, meow.
It seems like he's\nsaying goodbye...
I've become acquainted with\nthe orange tabby. I should\nlook for him again sometime.
I still feel like he wants to\ntell me something...
Ah. Well, it's not a model I need this time,\nbut a fellow photographer.
Does the problem lie with my choice of\nsubject, or my own skill...?
Gah, curse my lack of artistic sense! Is that\nreally all I'm worth?
O-Oh... It's you. Hey there.
It's about my photography, actually... Do you\nhave a moment to talk?
I think I mentioned this earlier, but my\nmotif is the concept of "change."
Recently, I've been feeling an aura of\n"change" all over Shinjuku...
But I just haven't been able to get a single\nshot I'm satisfied with. To be honest, I'm\nin a bit of a slump.
That's exactly right! I knew that you would\nunderstand.
After all, in my opinion, you yourself are\nquite emblematic of "change."
...Hm. Now that I'm talking to you, I feel\nlike I could try taking a few more photos.
I was actually thinking of changing my\napproach and getting a few shots of\nShinjuku's nighttime scenery.
Speaking of which, could I ask you to\ncome along?
It won't be anything that difficult. I'd just\nlike someone to bounce ideas off of.
I'd like to hear your honest feedback.
That would be enough for me, and I think it\ncould be a particularly invigorating\nexperience.
It'll be a nighttime shoot, of course, but I\nwon't make you stay out that late.
Just a tiny little favor, but I'll make it\nworth your while. What do you think?
Thanks! You're really helping me out.
Well then, I'll meet you here later tonight.\nI'll be waiting!
Hey, I've been waiting for you. Sorry for\ntaking up your time.
There were a few locations I had in mind...
Let's head over there right now, before it\ngets too late.
When you think of Shinjuku at night, you\ndefinitely have this image of streets\nglowing with neon...
It's pretty easy to see why, but, well...
Actually, what do you think?
Exactly. I'm trying to portray "change,"\nand I just don't feel that here.
Okay, let's go to the next location.
This place has a much different feeling...\nLike we've gone much deeper, into the\ntrue Shinjuku...
How do you feel about it?
That's true... People have probably seen\nthis all over the media. We'd hardly be the\nfirst to photograph it.
If I'm shooting Shinjuku, I want to capture\nthat Shinjuku vibe... But if it's too clich\xe9,\nit's boring.
When I've been feeling that sense of\n"change" here, it's...
...Yeah, let's head to the next place.
Now this is the place I really wanted to\ncome to.
Most people would think of Shinjuku at night\nas a city just for adults, but...
These days, a lot of people around my age\ncome here too. There's all kinds of trendy\nplaces around this area.
The public transportation has improved a lot\nas well. Look, right over here.
This kind of subtle, unexpected change...\nMaybe that's what I've been looking for.
Is that guy over there a student? He doesn't\nseem like an adult...
It's fine. His face isn't in the shot.\nIn fact, he's facing the complete\nopposite direction.
And I'll check with him after I take the\nphotos, just to be sure. If he has any\nproblem, I'll just delete them.
This is such a natural composition right now,\nthough, and I don't want to lose\nthat atmosphere.
Anyways, the color tone of this shot...
What do you think about something like this?
Right. In that case...
How's this? Maybe a monochrome shot would\nsuit this scene.
I see. In that case...
How's this? Personally, I think it looks\ngreat.
Okay, now that we've figured out our vision,\nlet's put it all together!
Yeah... It's been a while since I've felt\nthis way taking photos.
It's thanks to your input. I really\nappreciate it.
Ah, that's right! I should check with that\nguy about the photo I took.
I hope he doesn't get mad at me... If he\ndoes, I'll just apologize and delete the\ndata.
Huh? He's gone already...
That's not good. Now I have no way to get\nhis permission...
Oh well. Maybe I can just crop the photo\nso he's not visible...
It's still a pretty good shot without him in\nit, so I'd hate to let it go to waste.
I'll edit these photos when I get back home,\nand then upload them to my social media.
Thanks for coming out with me today. You\nhelped me take some great shots.
I did promise to give you a reward, but it's\ngetting late, so I'll give it to you\ntomorrow. That okay with you?
Okay. Then, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey. Is this a good time to talk?
About that reward I mentioned... Are you\nable to come to Shinjuku right now?
...Also, there's something I need to tell\nyou about.
It's a bit too long to explain... I'd rather\ntalk face-to-face.
Well then, see you...
I headed to Shinjuku to meet\nwith Shimizu...
Now I've done it... I never thought it\nwould've turned out like this...
Oh, it's you. Sorry, I kind of spaced out\nfor a moment there...
I haven't really slept since last night.\nA lot of things happened...
Um... well, actually...
...Sorry, my head's a bit fuzzy from lack\nof sleep. I haven't really processed my\nfeelings yet.
I know I just called you out here, but do\nyou mind if I rest for a bit?
Maybe I could buy something\nto wake him up, like a\nstrong tea...
Oh, is that...?
I gave Shimizu the tea...
Thanks... That's helped me perk up a little,\nat least...
I'm really sorry for causing you so\nmuch trouble.
You see... I posted that picture online last\nnight, and it caused a bit of an outrage.
I did crop it so that guy wasn't in the\nshot, but when I went to post it...
I ended up posting the uncropped version\nby mistake.
I'd been working until morning, and went to\nbed without even realizing what I'd done...
Just a few hours later, I woke up to a ton\nof notifications on my phone.
I guess that guy in the photo I took... is a\nfairly popular young idol.
You can't see his face at all, but his fans\nwould recognize him from any angle.
And now my profile is full of\ntheir comments...
They were all like, "Did you ask before you\ntook this?" and "Don't invade an idol's\nprivacy!" That sort of thing...
I never meant to upload it, so I took it down\nimmediately and apologized in\nthe comments...
But the internet works too fast. People\nalready screenshotted it and were spreading\nthe picture around.
I really don't know. But a pretty significant\nnumber of his fans seem to think it is.
So far, I haven't actually heard anything\nfrom him or his agency...
But still, this is all because I was too\ncareless. I really regret it.
And of course, I feel bad about causing so\nmuch trouble for you, too.
Yeah... I don't think there was anything\nwrong with taking the picture.
But photographers do need to be responsible.\nAfter all this, I'm sure I won't forget that.
This is the age we live in. One photograph\ncan throw a person's entire life into chaos.
Even so... I realized I do love photography\nafter all.
I think I've learned some important lessons\nfrom this whole ordeal.
Also... buried among all those comments,\nthere were a few actual opinions on\nthe photo.
They said it was a good shot, and I really\ncaptured the feeling of modern Shinjuku...
Regardless of whether he was an idol or not,\nthey understood why I wanted to take\nhis photo...
Those few comments gave me a bit of hope.\nThe things I wanted to say really did\nget across.
Sorry, I went on a bit long there. This\nisn't anything you need to worry about.
I just thought I should let you know...
Oh, almost forgot. Here's the reward I\npromised you.
Despite how things turned out, I hope you'll\ncome along with me again sometime.
All right, see you later.
My phone's ringing...\nWho could it be?
Looks like it's\nfrom Shimizu...
Hey, {NAME1}. Is this a good time to talk?
Well, you see, I've got this idea I wanna\ntry out...
I was trying to find someone who could help\nout with it, but once again you're the first\nname that came to mind.
Oh, you're interested? Well, if you have\ntime, I'd like to talk face-to-face.
So... Want to meet by that burger shop on\nCentral Street in Shibuya?
Guess that's settled, then! I'll head over\nthat way now too.
Well then, see you soon.
Sorry for calling you out of the blue. But I\nfigured you'd probably be willing to\nhelp me out.
Right, I'll cut to the chase.
That other time, when I uploaded the photo\nand caused all that outrage, it was a real\ndisaster.
But getting reactions from so many people\ndid give me some good motivation.
So this time, I want to create something\nthat will resonate with people a bit more.
Yeah. Lately, I've been thinking...
I'll come up with some topics, and interview\npeople on the street about them.
We'll record the whole thing on video, and\ntake photos at the end.
Right, that's the key point here.
The motif of a photo can be hard to convey\nto people unfamiliar with the medium.
So to compensate for that, I thought I could\nalso take a video to discuss what I wanted\nto communicate about the motif.
Right. Just like last time, I'd like you to\nact as my advisor...
Or maybe "planner" would be more accurate.\nFeel free to be proactive in throwing\nout ideas.
Your insight has such a rich sense of\n"change." More than I could ever imagine\non my own.
So how about it? Want to come help me\nout again?
Good to hear. I'm so glad you're interested.
So, before this creative inspiration fades,\nlet's head out and start shooting right away.
Once you've finished eating, let's start\nover by Shibuya Crossing.
So, before we begin our interviews, I think\nwe should decide on our first topic.
What do you think would be good? Perhaps...\n"What's your favorite food?"
How's that sound to you?
Good point, you're exactly right. It doesn't\nhave that magnificent, fascinating quality\nthat I'm after.
That said, just what kind of topic would\nbe best?
Ah, that's right... "Change."
For the sake of the interview, we could\nphrase it as, "What sort of changes have you\nexperienced recently?"
Yes, I think that sort of question should\ninspire some good responses.
When we take photos afterward, the subject\nwill understand the theme better.
Okay. We've decided on our topic, so let's\nbegin the interviews.
An interview? You guys don't exactly look\nlike a TV crew...
Oh, no, it's nothing like that... I'm just\nmaking a video.
A video...?
I've heard about things like this. A while\nback, there was some influencer causing\ntrouble shooting videos in public...
Are you two planning on making me an\ninternet laughingstock!?
You two are students, aren't you? Once you've\nentered the workforce, you won't have time\nto mess around like this.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back\nto the office.
Shoot... He turned really aggressive\nout of nowhere.
Yeah, that happens a lot when you're taking\nsnapshots, too.
In fact, I'd say most people have a negative\nresponse to unsolicited interactions\nlike that.
But let's not be discouraged. We'll just\nshake it off and find the next subject.
Huh, an interview? And... you want it\non video?
No way, no way! Video footage is totally\noff-limits!
Hey, you're not... live-streaming right now,\nare you?
Ah, that's a relief... I'd be in huge trouble\nif my mom saw this.
I skipped cram school today since I felt like\ngoing to the arcade.
Ugh, what a pain! And, honestly, I'm not\nreally interested in that interview anyway.
Anyways, I'm out of here. I didn't cut class\nso I could talk to you!
Sorry for bothering you...
Let's not worry about it. That still wasn't\nas bad as the first person.
Yeah, that's the spirit. Thanks, you're a\nhuge help.
This time, let's try to find someone who\nlooks like they'd really be willing\nto talk...
Good thinking. A store employee wouldn't be\nallowed to be that rude to us...
There's a cr\xeape shop right around here.
Okay, let's head over there next.
What? You're doing a video interview?\nSounds like fun!
I love watching videos online. I do it all\nthe time!
And it should be some good publicity for\nthe shop, too!
Yep, totally fine! Make sure I look\ncute, okay?
So then, what should I talk about?
Change...? Hm, let me think...
Oh! Actually, I'd been dating this guy\nrecently, but...
Some stuff happened, and we broke up...
Well, I wouldn't say that...
I mean, I was kinda depressed right after\nwe split...
But then, the cr\xeapes from this shop cheered\nme right up!
They're so delicious and sweet, they make me\nway happier than any guy I've ever met!
So that's when I made up my mind. I'm going\nto marry these cr\xeapes!
So, how's that? The secret origin of the\ncr\xeape shop girl! Wasn't it a great story?
Hmm... This is harder than I expected.
In the end, the only one we can use is from\nthat girl at the cr\xeape shop.
Yeah. She did say she was really looking\nforward to seeing her video and photo,\nat least.
I'll go home and edit the video today.\nIf I hurry, I should be able to upload\nit by tonight.
It's my first video, so I don't expect it\nto get many views right away...
We'll just have to be patient. This is a\nmemorable first step.
Shimizu is calling me.\nIt's probably about the\ninterview video...
Hey, is this a good time?
Right, about that... I've got good news\nand bad news.
I'll start with the good news. The interview\nvideo got a fair amount of buzz.
When I saw all those comment notifications,\nI was worried I'd started another outrage.
But the comments had nothing to do with my\nmotif of "change," or the photos I took...
The top-rated comments are...
"The cr\xeape shop girl is super cute! Forget\nthe cr\xeapes, marry me instead!"
"She must really love cr\xeapes. And she's\ngreat on camera, too."
"I'm going to check out that shop and see\nif I can meet her."
"It's so unfair you only talked to her!\nCome interview our store, too!"
It's pretty much all like that. That employee\ntook all the attention.
But unlike last time, at least it's all\npositive reactions.
Yeah. I certainly have more motivation to\ncontinue with this project.
And... I don't think I could've made this\nvideo without your support.
I had high hopes for the positive change you\nwould bring about, you see.
You really are the best partner for me\nafter all.
Thanks. I'm looking forward to working\nwith you more.
When I'm ready to make the next video,\nI'll be sure to give you a call.
I can't wait to see what we can create\nnext time.
Oh my...
That's very kind of you. How about we do\nsomething when you have the time then?\nMaybe even... go on a date...?
Hey, you!
I was hoping to snap a few photos of you.\nDo you mind?
Ah, sorry to accost you out of nowhere.\nDon't worry, I'm not some sort of weirdo.
You're just so... magnificent. I must\ncapture you.
Or perhaps you could say "exquisite."
Why the look of distrust?
I certainly am.
Wait! No, I meant I'm not a weirdo! Although\nthere are some who might argue with that.
Sorry, let me explain. I can feel you growing\nmore suspicious as we speak.
But I think it might be faster if I showed\nyou what kinds of pictures I take.
This is a photo album of my work.
I started carrying it around because people\nkept thinking I was taking creep shots.
But I'm not, I promise. See for yourself.
I looked at some\nof his photos...
They're all so vibrant.\nI can really sense the\nlife in them.
What do you think? My motif is the concept\nof "change."
I want to capture the beauty and magnificence\nthat change brings.
Really!? You're too kind.
Odd? Which do you mean?
"Stray Cats," "Morning Sun," and "Gold Teeth"\nall fit the theme, so...
The design of that cap was changed this year.
Not just once, but twice!
I took photos of both, of course. See? Take a\ncloser look.
Oh, maybe you're saying there's a lack of a\nunifying theme amongst the subjects?
But like I said, my photos are all about\ncapturing change.
A change in time, a tooth changing to gold,\neven minor changes in a bottle cap...
Aren't they wonderful? I find them stunning.\nEvery time I look at them, it takes\nmy breath away.
He seems to really\nenjoy this...
There are changes within you I want\nto capture.
I am a photographer, albeit an amateur one.\nI'm always observing everything around me.
When I saw you at the station before, you\nseemed more lethargic to me.
But now you're like a different person\nentirely. It's like you found a purpose.
I won't pry into the why... But I sense an\nalluring change happening inside you.
That's why I called out to you.
So, allow me to ask you once more. Please,\nmay I take your photograph?
Thank you! I'm so glad you understand.
Great. I'm certain I've captured some\namazing images here today.
Say, would you mind if I continue to follow\nyour changes over time?
There's just something special about them...\nCome talk to me if the mood strikes you.
I met Rikuto Shimizu,\na student with a passion\nfor photography.
I should talk to him\nnext time I see him...
I wonder what he's up to...
I returned home while on\nthe phone with Shimizu...
There's some odd photos...\nIs that one just a\nplastic bottle cap?
Who wants to aim for the national stadium with us!?
Hey you! You've got a fierce look about you.
Like you're always on the hunt. I bet you've got what it takes to be a striker!
Well, that's the gist of it.
Can you spare a minute?
No, no, I meant it as a compliment.
You just seem special somehow.
So you're a second year too, huh, {NAME1}? Nice to meet you!
So, uh, you're probably wondering why I'm so insistent on talking to you.
Truth is, a lot of our members have been quitting recently. Saying they've lost motivation or something.
And it's not just us. The other clubs are losing members too.
Now we've dipped below 11 members, so we don't have enough players to field a team.
Please, {NAME1}! I'm begging you! Join the soccer team!
There are less than 11 of us now, so you'll be a regular right from the get-go!
I can join this club and\nstill participate in other\nclub activities.
The team could really use you! Please!
Really? That's great! Thank you!
You're an absolute lifesaver. Now we can play in games again.
Let me introduce you to everyone! This way! Follow me!
Long story short, {NAME1}'s decided to join the team!
Now we have the 11 members we need to play.
Let's all try to work together, okay?
Oh, I almost forgot. Have you ever played before?
I see! Then we can count on you to be a valuable asset to the team!
It'll be a problem for us if this new guy's just pretending to be some expert.
Really? Well, I'm sure you've got what it takes. You'll pick it up in no time, I promise.
Should we really bring in someone with no experience?
Crap. Now we'll actually have to play games. What a pain.
Kurosawa's so desperate he'll take anyone. That's hilarious.
You guys! Don't be so rude! {NAME1}'s doing us a favor here!
Wait, Kurosawa.
You get why they're worried, right?
Kadota...
But we won't know what to do with you till we've seen what you're made of.
So, mind facing off against me in a round of penalty kicks?
What are you saying, Kadota!? Not you too!
I don't want us wasting anyone's time. Let's just see what he can do already.
All of the other players are\nwatching... I don't think I\ncan back down.
Well, {NAME1}? Feeling up to the challenge?
That's the spirit. Just know, I'm not gonna go easy on you.
Are you being modest? Or are you for real? Well, only one way to find out.
This guy has no clue what he's up against, does he? Kadota was the goalkeeper for the regional league team.
Heck, Kurosawa and Kadota are the two pillars propping up the whole team.
Can this guy even get the ball into the net?
Sorry, {NAME1}! I didn't mean to put so much on your plate so suddenly.
But could you please play along so we can change their minds?
Kadota may be our guardian angel, but maybe you have a chance...
It's settled! {NAME1} wins!
Ngh!? How did you beat me?
Seriously? I can't believe Kadota lost.
Huh. He's better than I thought.
Well, if he wants to join that bad, let him.
Well done, {NAME1}. I knew you had it in you!
Well, penalty kicks give the kicker an overwhelming advantage, but...
Still, that was amazing! Going head-to-head with Kadota like that!
I think the other players seem a bit more motivated after seeing you play.
I hope your presence will be a positive influence on the team.
Oh, sorry. I forgot to mention, you made the team just now.
So, let me officially welcome you to the Kokatsu Academy Soccer Team.
Happy to have you aboard! Let's aim for the national stadium together!
*huff* *huff* It's finally over.
That was exhausting...
Let's get out of here. I've got some TV to watch.
The balls are still\nscattered around...
And we haven't done\nfield maintenance.
Huh? If you wanna do it, go ahead.
We're too tired for that. Catch you later.
Huh? Where did everyone go?
I explained that everyone\nbailed on cleanup duty.
Ugh, not again...
Sorry, {NAME1}. That's no way for them to treat our newest member.
Remember how I told you a lot of our players lost interest and quit all of a sudden?
It really took a toll on morale for the ones who stuck around.
They're just barely participating in club activities as it is.
Things like tending to the field and post-practice cleanup fall by the wayside.
But that's just the way it goes, so I usually take care of it all myself.
I wanna do something to change the attitude around here.
That's why I was recruiting players, trying to make it so we have the minimum needed to play.
Then you came along and agreed to join. Can you imagine how thrilled I was?
I'm definitely going to change things around here, so just hold out till then, okay?
Great! Thanks. It's a huge relief having you around.
I know! Why don't we practice a bit before cleaning up?
You're skilled, but you've only just joined. You're struggling to make team plays, right?
That's why I'm thinking we should practice making plays between the two of us first.
If the other guys see us cooperating, they'll probably start thinking of doing the same with you.
Basically, I'm saying we should get some secret training in by ourselves. What do you say?
I trained in secret\nwith Kurosawa...
After training, the two of\nus cleaned up together.
All right! Done cleaning. Thanks for helping out.
Good work today. Ready to head out?
Oh, you know what!? We should stop for curry on the way home!
Of course! I know it's a little late, but we should celebrate you joining the team.
Shimokita is better known for curry. Don't worry! Naan makes a great snack!
There's a curry shop I visit often. I'll take you there.
I ate curry with Kurosawa\nand returned home.
Oh hey, {NAME1}. Can you come to\npractice today?
Glad to hear it! Let's head straight to the\nfield, then!
Oh... Well, I guess you've got stuff going\non. Let me know if you can join us later!
We're going to split into two teams and do a scrimmage!
We don't have enough for full teams, so it'll be five on five.
I'll be the referee. That leaves exactly five on each team.
No fair! I wanna sit around and watch as\nthe ref.
Sorry, man. I called it.
Okay, let's split the remaining members into two even teams.
I ended up on\nKurosawa's team...
All right. Time to show them all how much our secret training has paid off!
Our teamwork is going to blow everyone out of the water!
Hey. This looks like it'll be an interesting match.
Kadota, you're on the other team, right? Go easy on us, will you?
Nah, not gonna happen.
I'm gonna get revenge for the penalty shootout the other day, {NAME1}.
You and Kurosawa aren't going to get a single shot in. That's all I came to say.
Looks like he's starting to see you as a rival.
No, it's a good thing. Kadota's been feeling unmotivated lately, but...
Exactly! You know, Kadota's been pretty unmotivated lately, but...
You must've lit a fire under him!
Now we just need to stoke it!
{NAME1}! Here comes a pass!
Crap, they're right in front of the goal!
Where did all this team play come from!?
Damn it! I gotta stop him!
Foul!
You okay, {NAME1}? Can you make the kick?
A one-on-one shootout against Kadota... It's just like the day you joined.
Kadota is more motivated than he was back then...
But so are you. Show them where all that secret training got you!
Come at me. I'll stop you for sure this time!
Way to go, {NAME1}!
Nice shot, {NAME1}! Looks like last time wasn't a fluke!
I never doubted you from the start!
Damn it! I lost again!
The penalty kick changed\nthe flow of the game...
Our team won!
We won! All that training paid off!
Right? That was one fine pass if I do say so myself.
No way. I'm a striker. If I think I can score, I'll take the shot without hesitation.
At the time, I just thought it was best to pass the ball to you.
I need to talk to you.
Don't look so scared. I'm not here to complain or anything.
The opposite, actually. I may have lost, but that was a great match.
Your kicks awakened something in me. Something I lost sight of lately.
My passion for soccer. I can feel it starting to come back to me.
That's great, Kadota! You played one hell of a game too!
Hey, umm... {NAME1}. Sorry about fouling you earlier.
Playing soccer with you got me fired up.
I haven't felt this way in forever. I guess your spirit's rubbing off on me.
Just as I'd hoped. You're proving to be a real positive influence on the team.
This might be the perfect time to step things up a notch!
Kurosawa and I celebrated \nour victory at the curry shop.
I gave my name and class...
I can join the soccer\nteam now...
Here he comes...
I want to make an announcement before we start today.
We're going to have a scrimmage against a team from another school.
Whoa, seriously?
We haven't done that in a while. Who are we playing?
Our opponent will be Nanjo Academy!
Ugh... Not them.
Right? I'm sick of losing to those guys.
We have a long history with them. You could say they're our rivals.
Recently we've had a bad losing streak against them, and everyone's feeling pretty bitter about it.
That might be true, but it's not like they're better than us. We can beat them!
And then, we'll ride that momentum all the way to the upcoming tournament!
That sounds like a nice plan and all...
But if we lose, I don't know if we'll ever recover our confidence.
Sure, it's easy to say that, but what if we lose!?
As long as {NAME1} scores, and I don't let them score back, the win is ours.
Hey! Not you too, Kadota...
Hold it, Kadota! What about your steel-willed striker, Yota Kurosawa!?
Oh, yeah. Forgot about you.
What do you mean you forgot!?
But soccer's an 11-person game. Kadota and I can't win on our own.
That's why we've got to win this as a team! Right guys!?
All right. Let's show 'em what we're made of!
Having so many members quit was a bummer. But we can't mope about it forever!
I won't lose to a new member like {NAME1}. And I won't lose to Nanjo either!
Yeah. I think I've been pretending I didn't care just to cope with everything. But not anymore.
Whoa, why's everyone so motivated all of a sudden? I guess I wanna win too then!
You guys...! Thank you!
I felt our team members unite\nin determination before the\ncoming match.
Practice resumes...
Yes! Again!
Haha. Feels like we're taking things seriously for the first time in forever!
Look, {NAME1}. Everyone's practicing harder than ever.
This is what I've been wanting to see. I forgot how good this feels...
This is all thanks to you, {NAME1}.
Sorry, Kurosawa! You okay?
Y-Yeah, I'm fine.
Whoa! Are you hurt?
Heh, gotcha!
Dude! Don't scare me like that.
That was a close one though. I could have been seriously hurt. Be more careful, all right?
Sorry. I was just chasing the ball and...
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Let's get back to practice.
Huh? Oh, it's nothing!
Let's get back to practice! We have to stay focused!
Haaah, finally done.
Everyone's more motivated than ever today.
Well, we wanna beat Nanjo, right? Gotta keep workin' hard.
I don't see Kurosawa\nanywhere... Where could he\nhave gone?
I decided to go look for him.
Nngh!
{NAME1}!?
Ack! Haha, bad timing.
I don't think it's broken. Might just be a light sprain.
It's fine! It'll heal if I just stay off it.
You're overreacting! It's not nearly bad enough for that!
Could you keep quiet about this?
Everyone's finally motivated. I don't want to dampen the mood.
Plus, we don't have bench players. Without me, we can't play in the scrimmage.
The last thing I want to do is make everyone anxious.
It'll be fine. There's still a few days until the scrimmage.
I can still come to practice, and I'm sure it'll heal on its own by the game. So don't worry, okay?
Is he really okay...?
I understand how Kurosawa\nfeels. I guess I'll trust him\nfor now.
Thanks, {NAME1}.
I know! Let's get some curry on the way home. Curry and some sleep might just fix me up.
A limping Kurosawa and I\nvisited the curry shop before\nheading home...
Today's our scrimmage against Nanjo!
Let's show them what the new Kokatsu Academy Soccer Team can do!
Yeeeah!
Show 'em what we've been practicing! No mistakes today!
We got this! Let's show 'em!
Yeeeah! I'm all fired up!
{NAME1}...
Haha... Nothing gets past you.
I'll be fine. I can stick it out till the match is over.
Not happening. I can't let everyone down. Not you, not the team, not Nanjo either.
Honestly, I might not be. But I have to pull through today.
I'm really grateful for everything you've done.
You know, I was at my wits' end back when I was recruiting for new members.
If I couldn't get us a new member, we would've had to disband.
I think I might've already given up back then.
Then you came along. We struggled side-by-side, and now our team's back in high spirits.
It's all because of you that we're here now.
That's why I don't want the momentum you've created for us to stop here!
I'm begging you, {NAME1}. Could you keep quiet about my leg for just a little longer?
Thanks. But I can't just rely on you for every\u2014
Wait. Hold on a second. That might actually be a good idea.
The practice match begins...
Damn it! We're running out of time!
They're behind by a point! Let's score some goals and secure the win!
Like we'd let that happen! We need to tie\nit up, guys!
We're counting on you, Kurosawa!
Stop Kurosawa!
Kokatsu's nothing if we keep him covered!
Ack. Now I have to make the shot from here...
Or so you'd think!
Hey! Who's that guy!?
I don't know! Was he on the team before!?
All right! We're tied!
Game over!
That was a close one! Looks like my plan worked out.
Nanjo knows us all too well, so I knew they'd target me.
I took advantage of that\u2014drew their attention so you could score!
Ideally, we would've scored early and then defended the lead to the end...
But I guess it wasn't going to be that easy. At least we got a tie out of it!
Doesn't that mean we're going into overtime!?
No, today's just a scrimmage, so we'll do penalty kicks.
Well, this is your time to shine, Kurosawa. Don't let us down, ace!
Sorry... My legs are shot. Can't kick a ball straight.
Huh? Did you get hurt!?
{NAME1} will take the kicks for me.
{NAME1}? Well, yeah, I guess it has to be him.
We're counting on you, {NAME1}! Win this for us!
You've got this. No doubt in my mind.
That settles it. We're counting on you!
You did it, {NAME1}! You're the best!
We won! We actually won!
Yeeeaaah! We did it! We woooon!
It might just be a scrimmage, but it's our first win with this lineup!
Hey, Kurosawa. You've been hiding an injury, haven't you?
Wait. Was it from when I bumped into you?
My bad. It was a light injury, so I didn't think I needed to bring it up.
It's all on me for keeping quiet and not letting it heal. Sorry, guys.
Kurosawa...
But now I'm going to focus on getting better.
And I promise I'll be back by the time the tournament rolls around.
You better be. Until then, we'll train and get even stronger.
Great. Our next goal is to play in the tournament and get through the first round!
We'll be counting on you, {NAME1}!
I shared the joy of our first\nvictory with everyone on\nthe soccer team...
{NAME1}, you came! We've got a game today,\nare you ready for it?
Great. I'll let everybody know!
Ah, got it. Let me know when you're done,\nthen!
Minami, I wanna play soccer! Can I go get my ball?
We're not allowed to play soccer here, remember? Minami-chan, let's play the game from yesterday again!
Mei's right. It's not safe, so we can't, okay?
But I think we should do something Yuma wants today, since we played Mei's game yesterday.
Yay!
Something Mei and Hiroto like too would be good. What do you want to play?
Ah, Hiroto! Don't go off too far! It's not safe!
Okaaay.
I hope he doesn't\nget himself hurt...
I decided not to interfere...
Wa... Waaaaaah!
Looks like he skinned his\nknee... It's bleeding a\nlittle bit.
Hiroto! Are you all right!?
I told the older girl how\nthe boy skinned his knee.
Thank you. So he tripped and scraped it...
Ah, you're right. It's bleeding a little.
We'd better get it washed up first. Then\nI'll take care of it, okay?
Oh, do we have any bandages left?
She has a first aid kit on\nhand? She must be used\nto taking care of injuries.
Oh, this?
Little kids get themselves hurt all the\ntime, so I always bring this with me.
Oh good, I do have some.
Minami!
Minami, Mei's being mean! Make her stop!
'Cause you can't sit still like Minami-chan\ntold us to!
She didn't say we weren't allowed to move!
I need you two to wait a little more, okay?\nHiroto hurt himself, so...
Looks like she's got\nher hands full...
Um, there's a game my teacher showed us!
Do you wanna play too?
Yeah! Minami-chan's busy.
But we're running out of time! I wanna play\nthe game my teacher showed me!
Maybe I should play with them\nfor a bit...
I told them I'd join their\ngame until the older girl\ncame back.
Really? Yay!
Oh, um...
Thank you so much. It's a huge help.
I'll just take care of Hiroto's knee, and\nthen I'll be right back in a flash!
Ah! Minami-chan, you're back!
Yes, yes, I'm here!
Sorry for just dragging you into this. You\nreally were a lifesaver, uh...
I told her my name...
{NAME1}-san? Nice to meet you!
Got it! {NAME1}-kun, then.
So, forgive me if I'm wrong, but do you live\naround here?
I knew it! I thought I'd seen your face\naround here before.
Hey, Minami! Come give me a hand!
Okay! I'm coming!
Everybody! Uncle's calling, so we're going\nback to the shop now!
That means it's juice time! What flavor does\neveryone want?
Orange!
Me too!
Oh! Me too, me too!
Don't worry, Hiroto, there's plenty for\neveryone. No need to run!
Sorry for being in such a hurry! I'll thank\nyou properly next time!
All right, back to the shop, everyone!
I watched as Minami and\nthe kids hurried off...
Hey Minami-chan, when will my mom be back?
She said she'd come get you as soon as she's\ndone with work. Play with us until\nthen, okay?
What about my mom?
Oh, I'm not sure... I'll ask later, okay?
It looks like Minami has to\ntake care of those kids.
Oh, you're that guy from before!\nUh... {NAME1}-kun!
I decided to leave so I don't\nget in their way...
Everybody, remember? This is the guy who\nplayed that game with us before!
Hello!
Haha... Come on, it's rude not to say hello,\nyou know?
Sorry, he's a shy one.
Hey, hey, Mister! Let's play that\ngame again!
Huh!? We said we were gonna play a different\ngame today! We can't!
Hey, no fighting!
Oh, that's right! I said I'd thank you\nproperly this time, but I didn't bring\nanything!
{NAME1}-kun, do you have some time?\nIt's nothing special, but as thanks...
Ah, there you are. Miyashita-san!
Oh yes, hello! Sorry, was no one at\nthe shop?
Yeah, I tried calling out at the shop front\nbut it looks like he's round the back...
Ah... Got it. Sorry, but could you take it\nto the back door this time?
All right, got it!
I wanna keep playing that game!
No, let's play another one!
Come on you two. Back to the shop! And kids\nwho fight get no juice!
What!? Oh no, I couldn't! I'd feel bad\nasking you again, and...
Sorry. Truth be told, I really could use an\nextra pair of hands.
We're going to the front of the shop,\neveryone! Follow me!
Ah, sorry 'bout that! It's always like this\naround here...
Our shop is right over there. Could you come\nalong? It'd be great if you could\nwatch the kids.
Oh, wait, wait! I just need to pick up\nthe delivery.
Our shop is right over there, just wait for\nme by the entrance!
Yaaaay!
I headed to Minami's place\nwith her and the kids.
Mister, is your house close to here?\nMine is!
One time, I came here to eat with Mom and\nDad! And then\u2014
From what they're saying,\nMinami's not actually these\nkids' big sister...
It seems they're neighborhood\nkids who know Minami and\nher family.
Seems like she spends time\nwith them until their parents\nget home from work...
Is Minami here yet?
Okay, but I want to play soon!
Hey, Minamiii! Setup's finished.
Huh? Who're you, kid?
Sorry for the wait!
{NAME1}-kun, sorry for leaving them\nwith you again!
Oh, Minami, you know this guy?
Yeah, though I just met him recently.\nApparently he lives in the neighborhood?
Oh, does he now!
That explains why he looks familiar! I must\nhave seen him around the area if he's local.
Nice to meetcha! What do ya go by?
This is my dad, sorry he's such a nuisance!
This person helped me out when Hiroto skinned his knee.
I wanted to thank him, but then we got a delivery, so it had to wait.
Ah, I see. Sorry if my daughter's causing you trouble!
She's a real busybody that insists she can help with the shop and watch those kids at the same time.
Kids aside, I'm always telling her there's no need for her to help with the shop, but...
It's fine! It always helps sales to have a cute girl up front, right?
Not that much, kid! I keep telling you, just focus on school, I can hire some help.
Come on dad, you know this place isn't big enough to afford to hire anyone...
It looks like Minami and her\ndad get along pretty well...
Oh no, sorry! I'm keeping you waiting again!
You want a soda? Or orange juice? I'll go get a few drinks.
Uncle! I'm thirsty, I want some too!
Me too! But I don't want a bubbly one!
All right, hold on a minute, wait yer turn...
Uncle?
Are you okay?
Ugh, yeah... Just haven't had a pang like that in a while...
It's probably because you turned around suddenly. Take a rest, I'll go get the drinks.
Everybody, just wait a minute, okay?
Take these. One for last time, and one for today.
Mister, are you going already?
Nooo! I wanted to play!
I guess they've taken a liking to you.
If you have the time, do you think you could come play with them again?
I can't offer much in return except juice and soda, but the kids and I would love it.
I said goodbye to Minami and\nthe kids and left the shop.
Shoko-san, good to see you!
Mama!
I'm back! I had to work a bit later than usual today.
Minami's talking with a mom\nand her son. Looks like she's\nhere to pick him up...
Sorry I'm so late tonight, Minami-chan. We had sudden deadlines at work, so...
It's no trouble. Hiroto was a good boy. It sounds like work was rough today.
Mama, your hand, does it hurt?
Your hand?
Oh, this? It's nothing. Just a papercut I got handling paperwork at the office.
Since it's so small, I just ignored it, but it does actually sting a bit.
The cut might be deeper than you think. Why don't I give you something to cover it with?
Please make sure to replace it when you get home. And rinse the wound with water again when you do.
Minami carefully explained how\nto care for the papercut...
You know so much about these things, Minami-chan. Thank you!
I look this stuff up sometimes. I feel like I just want to know, you know?
Oh, right, if the pain from the cut gets more severe, go see a doctor right away!
Of course, thank you. Well, goodbye then!
Bye Minami!
{NAME1}-kun! You weren't waiting to talk to me all this time, were you?
{NAME1}-kun! You were here this whole time?
Sorry I didn't notice you earlier! I just can't ignore it when I see someone injured.
Minami handled that like a\nprofessional... She'd probably\nmake a great nurse.
I decided to tell her\nwhat I thought.
Really? Hehe!
I've wanted to be a nurse ever since I was little. So hearing that makes me happy.
Ah... Yeah, that'd be nice...
Ah... Yeah, something like that, I guess.
Hey, Minami! Have the kids gone home?
Huh? Oh, {NAME2}-kun! What's up? You helping Minami out again?
No! He just came by a while ago. We were just chatting.
Haha. Sure, whatever you say. So what were you talking about?
Oh, uh, nothing important, really.
I told Minami's dad we were\ntalking about her dreams for\nthe future.
That so? And what'd she tell you?
Er, well... It wasn't about dreams for the future so much as...
Whenever I ask her, all she says is that she's gonna graduate and work at the shop.
There's something you're not telling me...
So there IS something you really want to do.
Minami... I'm always saying it, aren't I?\nOnce you're out of high school, chase\nyour dreams!
I meant what I said!
Like I'm always telling you, my future goal is to work here!
But that's not what you really want to do, it's what you think you have to do! Am I wrong?
Yes, you are! I never said I wanted anything else, even at career guidance at school!
And I've always told you not to worry about the shop, because I can hire a part-timer!
I don't need you to help me here. You don't need to force yourself!
How many times do I have to tell you I'm not forcing myself, you idiot!
I'll be in the shop!
Ah! Hey, Minami!
*sigh*... Ow...
Apologies... Don't worry about it, I'm fine...
Sorry you had to see all that. I shouldn't've gotten you involved.
Y'know, when she was little, she couldn't stop talking about how she wanted to become a nurse.
But right before she started elementary school, her mom passed from an illness.
I think seein' me so broken up back then gave her this habit of worrying about me so badly.
So I'd try to show her I was doing fine by throwing it all into work...
And I guess I worked too hard, since I ended up bustin' my back.
Ever since that, all I hear from her is, "I wanna help you at the shop!"
Even though all I want for her is to be free and follow her dreams, y'know.
Ah, what am I doin' makin' you sit here and listen to our family problems.
Hey {NAME2}-kun. Can I ask you to keep hanging out with Minami, for me?
It sounds like she can talk about things with you she can't say to me.
I'll be headin' in too, then. Say hi to your folks for me.
I said goodbye to Minami's\ndad and left the shop...
There we go...
It looks like Minami's\nhelping at the shop...
I decided to leave and not\nget in her way...
I'm sorry about last time, I made things weird...
Say, after that, did you talk to my dad? That's, um...
Never mind, sorry.
Just forget about all that.
Minami has a concerned look\non her face...
I decided to tell her that her\ndad was worried about her...
Oh, it's nothing, really.
It's not that I'm helping around the shop because I saw my dad crying or anything...
I mean, first off, he's the one who's overworking himself for me if I'm not there to keep him in check!
Oh, but what am I saying this to you for...
Hey, are you free now?
I'm kinda thirsty, so I'm gonna grab a lemonade. Why don't you have one with me?
Huh... Dad really told you all of that?
Even when he gets drunk, he rarely talks about Mom...
You must be a great listener, {NAME1}-kun. Maybe you'd be good at a job like that?
I do feel like I can say things I usually wouldn't when I'm talking to you, too.
It's not that I feel like I need to be here to support Dad.
It's just something I want to do. I'm not lying when I say that.
He may be a loud and annoying drunkard at times, but he's the type to work himself ragged for me.
How can I say that I want to become a nurse to help others when there is someone in need right in front of me?
...Maybe that's not exactly how I feel. I'm not sure how to put it.
If my mom were still here, she wouldn't just leave him like this.
My mom was a strong woman before she got sick.
She was a nurse, and a really cool one at that.
She was a nurse, and a really cool one at that. She was a strong person, too.
If someone was in trouble, she'd help them in a heartbeat. Kind of like a comic book hero.
There was this one time we were out playing together here, when an old lady suddenly collapsed.
Then, it was like my mom flipped a switch, and went into nurse mode.
She went through so many procedures, like calling to the woman, getting an AED...
I got really scared just watching. I didn't know what was going to happen...
But I heard that woman was saved thanks to my mom's treatment.
That's what made me want to follow in her footsteps.
I think... I want to be like my mom and become a nurse like her.
Someone who wouldn't hesitate to run in and save a person who needs help.
And that's why I can't just leave my dad on his own.
I know my dad cares a lot about me.
The idea of leaving someone to suffer so I can become a nurse is... It's wrong to me.
So I've given up on that. I'm just going to help my dad with his shop.
That's what I want to do.
Whenever I try to talk about this with my dad, we just end up fighting. Like you saw before.
I'm not really sure.
Ah... You're hitting where it hurts, huh...
Minami's dad said he wanted\nto make her dreams\ncome true...
I told her about the pain\nher dad feels.
Whenever I try to have a serious conversation with Dad, we always end up off track.
It's like... We're talking, and along the way I forget what I actually wanted to say.
And then it turns into a fight. It's always like that.
If something's upsetting him, he should say so! But he's always trying to act tough, so...
I end up making him feel worse when I'm trying to help him. It's ridiculous, isn't it!
{NAME1}-kun. Can I ask you a favor?
I want to have a talk with my dad. About my dreams.
And I would really appreciate if... um...
If you could be there when I do.
It seems like Dad and I both have an easier time being honest when you're there.
Maybe then we'd be able to have a real conversation about this without it falling apart.
I think it'd help me express my thoughts and feelings better.
Ah, not right now though! I need some time to think about what I want to say.
So if you're willing...
Thank you. When I'm ready to talk, I'll let you know.
Ah! The kids are going to be here soon!
I've got to go back to the shop. Thanks for listening.
I thanked Minami for the drink\nand saw her back to the shop.
So that thing we talked about before... The conversation I wanted you there for?
Could I ask you to do that now? Since Dad and I both have time.
The kids are here now, too. Dad's playing with them. Let's go.
Oh, that's fine! Sorry for springing it on you, I'll ask another time.
I headed into the izakaya\nwith Minami...
Hey there {NAME2}-kun.
Minami-chan! You're back!
Mister! Hi!
Hey, what're we gonna play today?
Sorry Yuma, can you wait till later to play with him?
All of us have some things we need to talk\nabout right now.
Hahaha. The kids really like you, huh!
So you're the one Minami said she was gonna go get. You've got something to talk about?
I did think over what I want to say to Dad before this.
So if we start going off track...
Hey now, you can't have a secret meetin' right in front of my face, y'know.
How about a drink while we talk? No alcohol, of course.
So, Dad. I have something important to talk to you about.
...Ah.
Hey kiddos, you head back inside for a bit. The grown-ups have to talk now!
All right then, let's hear this important thing you want to discuss.
And when did you two get so close, huh!?
This better not be about what I think it is, or you're in for it, boy!
He seems to have\nthe wrong idea...
Don't be stupid!
{NAME1}-kun's just here for moral support. It's not that kind of talk! It's a... more serious topic.
I have some things I want to say. About my future after high school, I guess...
Oh. I see. That's what you mean.
Perfect, I've got plenty of things to say\nabout that myself.
I told Minami's dad to hear\nher out.
All right. Go on, then.
Um, well... This might get long, but...
So that's basically the deal.
I do still want to be a nurse. A nurse like mom.
But I don't think I'll really be doing that if I leave you behind to do it, Dad...
Wh-What? If you've got something to say, say it.
You're still talkin'. I'm waitin' for you to finish.
I've thought about it a lot since we talked, {NAME1}-kun.
But... in the end I still couldn't figure out what to do.
I want to be a nurse, but I also want to help Dad.
I've been tearing myself up inside thinking about what to do but... I still can't find an answer.
No matter what I choose, it feels like I'm lying to myself.
So... I'm sorry for making you listen to my indecisive rambling. I'm done now.
So, can I talk now?
Sounds like I've been givin' you some real grief, Minami.
Thanks, {NAME2}-kun. It's my turn now.
Look, Minami.
I'm glad you're thinkin' of your old man, but you've got to rely on me too sometimes, okay?
The more you do for me, the more I feel like I need to care for you. 'Cause I'm still your dad.
And one more thing...
I want my Minami to be able to do whatever she wants.
I know. You always say that.
No. That just now is what your mom said.
We were talkin' about it while you were off at kindergarten, you wouldn't've heard.
I also felt the same, and I still do now. So if there's something you want to do, do it.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
Is there anything else you want to talk about?
C'mon, Minami, get over here.
This is embarrassing, Dad... {NAME1}-kun's here...
Sorry, {NAME2}-kun.
But anyway... You always used to say you wanted to be a nurse...
But you meant "a nurse like mom," huh?
When did your dreams get so big? You should've told me sooner.
Don't worry about it. Today's the first time we've really talked about it.
You can do it, Minami.
It's what your mom and I dreamed for you too, so you'd better go and do it, okay?
But y'know... Your mom was a pretty smart cookie.
If you wanna be like her, you'd better start studyin', all right?
Minami's voice choked\nwith tears...
Thanks, {NAME2}-kun.
Without you, we'd still be going round in circles with our silly quarrels.
Come by sometime when you're old enough to drink! It'll be on the house.
I gazed at the streets\nof Zoshigaya until Minami\nregained her composure...
Sorry I made you watch all that.
But I'm really grateful that you did. It was so good to have you here.
I'm going to aim to become a nurse someday, even if that means a lot of studying.
Still...
There's something mysterious about you, {NAME1}-kun. Something that makes me want to be more honest.
Say, {NAME1}-kun. After high school, what do you...
Minami-chan! Is the talking over yet?
Ah!? Don't scare me like that!
Mister, are you good at soccer? Let's play soccer!
Me too! I'm coming!
If you two want to play soccer, you'll have to go to the park. And be careful not to trip over!
*sniffle*...
Now, what did I tell you?
Hehe...
Minami and I went to play\nwith the kids...
It seems like Minami\nwants to talk...
That kid is playing\nby himself...
It seems as though Minami\nis about to appear...
My my, what are you doing here?
Hm? What's the matter? Trying to ask for\ndirections, young man?
I wouldn't if I were you! You won't get anything from all the drunks around here!
You said it! Especially as one of those\ndrunks yerself, Chizuko-san! Ahahaha!
Ah, shut your mouth! Anyway... This place is still dangerous for a kid your age.
C'mon back once you're old enough to drink.\nWe can have one together if I'm still around!
...Keep going straight on that road and you'll reach the station in no time. Stay safe, young man.
Hahaha! You're very welcome.
Well, who's to say.
Despite her outward demeanor, she was rather kind. Is this the path she spoke of?
I must agree, this doesn't seem like the safest part of town. Let us make haste.
Whoooa!
Ngh, that hurt! *hiccup* A lot!
Thish's gotta be a broken bone! C'mon,\nwhat're yeh gonna do to make thish right?
Can you believe this lush? He couldn't possibly have a broken bone...
What should we do? He appears to be\nintoxicated. How about we just leave him?
Even if he were to inform the authorities, I doubt they'd take any action...
Heeeyyy! Pay attenshun when an adult's\ntalkin' to ya, stupid little punk...!
That's enough!
Isn't that...
C'mon! You're a grown man and he's a child!\nWhat do you think you're doing!?
I've been hearing about this little scam of yours! I swear, the cops are useless!
Nobody's hitting a child around me so long as I've still got sight in this right eye!
Eeeek!
That's right! Run home, drink some water,\nthen go to bed. And don't come back!
He panicked and ran away...
Phew... Can you believe the world we're living in today? With people like him everywhere?
Everything okay, young man?
Are you kidding me? I was the one who told you to take this street. I'm sorry you had to experience that.
I'm just peachy. Well, so long as you're okay, young man.
You oughta be careful when you're on your own. People like that are everywhere these days.
...What are we doing standing and chatting\nhere? I'll take you to the station, but would\nyou mind giving me a moment first?
Don't worry. I don't have ulterior motives like that man. Just want to talk to someone young for a bit.
How rare. This woman appears to possess desires. Let's hear her out.
All right, then. We'll go to my regular. Oh, don't worry. They let kids in too.
I went to a bar with\nChizuko where they let\nminors inside...
Oh, I haven't even introduced myself yet. Chizuko Nagao, a 75-year-old granny.
Nice to meet you. So, {NAME1}-kun... You in high school?
Ah... Just about the same as my grandchild. Maybe that's why I wanted to talk to you... heh.
Go on, order whatever you like. Oh, but no hard drinks for you, young man.
Once you're as old as me, this stuff is all you can count on, you see.
Well... I do realize that drinking all day won't really do me a lick of good, of course.
I'm sure me being this way is why my grandchild doesn't trust me either...
...Oh, it's nothing. Why don't we say goodbye here? Sorry to drag you along with me.
Spots like this aren't bad either, right? Come by again some time.
A cold one, aren't you? Well, I take it you're just a little embarrassed.
Heh... You know, I thought the same thing the very first time I came here myself.
I'm glad you decided to come along. Wouldn't want you leaving in a bad mood, right?
You know what they say about us old ladies, always meddling in people's business.
Come on, I'll walk you to the station.
Feel free to reach out again if you ever feel like it, {NAME1}-kun.
Chizuko appears to\nbe sleeping...
I should wake her up...
I've been meeting up with\nChizuko at this jazz club a\nfew times now, but...
She seems even drunker than\nusual today...
Oh... You came, {NAME1}-kun. Sorry, looks like I dozed off.
...You've got a real keen eye. Seems like I can't hide anything from you.
Well... So like I told you before, I've got this grandchild.
The two of us live together, but... Well, it's complicated.
We're not on bad terms. I just don't know how to deal with someone like her.
Just today, I mighta said somethin' I shouldn't have. Maybe I open my mouth too much.
Agh... Yeah, you're right. I can't help but worry, though.
This grandchild of mine, you see... recently attempted suicide...
It was just so sudden... Someone who seemed so happy around me jumping like that...
I couldn't believe it when I got the hospital call. Critical condition and unconscious.
She's awake again, but... Walking is going to take her a while, they say...
Sure, I'm glad the worst didn't happen... But what I really want is for her to be happy.
So, when I think about something happening\nagain because I said the wrong thing...
I thought I knew it all full well, but today I...
I just hate myself. I either do the wrong thing or I do nothing at all...
I despise myself for being this way. It's the reason I keep escaping to this hole at night like this.
Heh... And now I'm even dragging a youngster like you into this. I really am an awful old lady.
But hey, I should count myself lucky in a way. I know that other people have it a whole lot worse than I do.
My granddaughter... Manaka. I can't even begin to imagine what she's going through.
Tell me, {NAME1}-kun. I don't mean to burden you with all this but...
As someone the same age as her, could you give this old lady some advice?
What should I do to cheer her up?
Let her relax, eh... How could I do that...\nAh, I could play her some music?
What Manaka likes...
She loves music. Especially singing.
You say that, but we're two generations apart...
Oh, that's it!
She loves music, just like me.
Back when she was feeling well, we would\ncome to this jazz bar together.
Manaka always seemed to enjoy herself here so much. Yes, maybe coming here would do her some good.
Oh, but bringing here to a crowded place all of a sudden could be too much...
Ah... I did see a poster on the wall that\nsays "Recruiting for Open Mic"...
One time we talked about performing together. Me on the sax... and Manaka on vocals.
I sure can. My late husband loved music. I tried all kinds of instruments myself.
You think so? Heh, now I want you to watch\nme play sometime.
I get it... I wanted to see her standing on the stage one day too.
Getting her there may be tough, but that\ndoesn't mean it's impossible.
Thank you, {NAME1}-kun. You helped me remember a lot of things I'd forgotten.
Seems like I had convinced myself there was only so much I could do for her.
I'm getting on in years, my left eye can't see so good anymore, I've got a bad back...
But saying I can't do anything because of that was nothing more than an excuse.
You know what? I think I will! Nothing more pathetic than giving up before you even try!
But, well... I am a little worried if it'll go well or not. If the timing works out...
Do you think you could be there too, {NAME1}-kun...?
Thank you. You alone would be all the support I need.
Of course you. Besides... I don't know if I can talk to her right if it's just the two of us.
I'll handle that part. My grandchild wouldn't get the message unless it's from me.
*sigh* Looks like I've been a huge coward all this time. I failed to notice the glaringly obvious.
But now that I've made up my mind, I'm gonna give this everything I have.
I might end up making a big fool of myself, but... I'm counting on you, {NAME1}-kun.
I should go look\nfor Chizuko...
I'll contact you again once I have a date.
Make it home safe, okay?
I parted ways with Chizuko\nat the station...
*hiccup* The hospital charges exshtra late at night... Bet it'd be a million yen or so...
Something smells delicious...
It smells like someone's\ngrilling eel.
The aroma's drawing me in...
Welcome. We grill eel to order here.
A delicious smell is coming\nfrom the unagi shop...
It's the western-style\nrestaurant that opened nearby.
There's so much variety\non the menu...
Should I eat here?
Welcome. Please take any open seat that\nyou'd like.
There's a great smell\ncoming from the kitchen...
The menu's full of so many\ndifferent dishes...
Welcome! The food we serve here isn't\nbound by any one genre.
Shimizu looks badly\nsleep-deprived...
Howdy there! Nice weather, huh? It's another\nperfect day here in Shibuya!
And you're here in Shibuya on this perfect\nday! I can tell you must really love Shibuya,\ndon't ya?
Good answer! I can tell you're a true\nShibuya believer.
Now then, looks like it's time for...
Shichi-kun's surprise Shibuya Quiz!
Get it right, and you'll win a special prize\nfrom me, Shichi-kun!
Naturally, this quiz is all about our lovely\ncity of Shibuya!
For a true lover of Shibuya such as yourself,\nthis should be a cinch!
Ready?
Right then, question one! Our first category\nis "local shopping"!
There's a ton of stores in the underground\nmall. You can find all sorts of amazing\nthings for sale there!
Now, suppose your friend from abroad is\nvisiting and you want to get them the perfect\ngift that just screams "Japan"...
Which store are you gonna head to?
Oooh, sorry, that's wrong!
Maybe you should take a closer look next\ntime you visit the underground mall.
But, that's just the first question out\nof three!
Don't lose hope now!
That's exactly right! I can feel the\nShibuya love!
Second question is coming in hot, so let's\nkeep it up!
Show me your true passion for Shibuya!
Question two! This time we're headed over\nto Central Street!
Shopping in Central Street is so much fun,\nbut there's almost too many delicious things\nto eat!
Now tell me, do you know the name of the\nburger restaurant on Central Street?
Ah, too bad! That's incorrect.
But sometimes even I forget the name of a\nrestaurant as soon as I walk through the door!
You've still got the third question left to\ngo, so don't let it get you down!
Hehe, that brings us to our third question!
Last one! You've got this!
Question three! This time, we're looking at\nthe Station Square!
The square in front of Shibuya Station is a\npretty famous meeting spot, you know?
You've probably made plans to meet your pals\nhere too a few times, I'm sure...
So... When you're meeting people at Station\nSquare, what kind of animal is the statue\nright in the center?
Whoops, too bad. That's not right. Maybe\nyou're just more of a cat person?
Next time you're at the Station Square,\ntake a closer look!
Too bad, that's incorrect!
But, if we did have a monkey here in front\nof Shibuya Station...
That would be pretty fun, huh?
Okay, that's all of my questions! You did\na great job!
And your final score is... 100%! You've got\nsome serious Shibuya love, I can tell.
I could tell you're a true Shibuya devotee!\nI'm so happy... *sniff* It brings a tear\nto my eye...
Seeing someone who loves Shibuya just as\nmuch as I do... Ah, this is what I live for!
Alright, for getting every single question\nright, you've earned a reward! Here, you\ndeserve this!
I hope you'll continue to spread the love\nfor Shibuya!
Until next time, then! Howdy-hey!
Maybe the questions were a bit too hard?
But don't feel bad! I've still got prizes\nwaiting for you.
Come back next time and aim for the top!
Yeah, yeah, that's the spirit! We've gotta\nlove Shibuya more and more!
Until then, howdy-hey!
I don't think I've ever\nlooked at the sky\nlike this before...
It's kind of beautiful...
Just looking at the sky can be rather nice\non occasion. Perhaps we should come again.
Looks like you can\ngo in to look at the\napartments here...
Yongen-Jaya seems like a\nnice place to live...
The curtains in the house\nacross the way are\nalways closed...
It makes me wonder what\nkind of person lives there...
Hmm... Yeah, I can see that.
Open the door.
It's the gymnasium.
Intruders?
I\u2014!
Now then, let's see what fate has in store\nfor you...
Clear your mind, and choose a tarot card...
How was your destiny-blazing\nfortune reading?
Ah, looks like you were able to get a seat.\nWould you like to read something on\nthe way there?
It's your choice. In that case, let's quietly\nenjoy ourselves until we arrive.
If you don't have a book to read, why not\ntry meditation? It can help you clear your\nmind, and you'll find it has many benefits.
I reflected on a battle\nagainst a powerful opponent\nin the past...
I quietly reflected on the\nqualities in people I admire.
I mentally reviewed the\ndelicate processes required to\nmake infiltration tools...
I quietly reflected on the\npeople I've formed important\nbonds with...
Welcome! Interested in hearing your fortune\nfor today?
Before I can reveal your fate, I'll take\nthe cash up front, please!
Okay. Now, just have a seat right there.
I look forward to seeing you next time!
O, holy power... Reveal to us the mysteries\nof the cosmos!

Hoom, looks like there's a note by the phone.
Someone picked up...
I have hidden some... things... all around.
See if you can find them all...\nThough, you don't have to\nif you don't want to...
I guess I'll look for these\n"things" the voice mentioned.
You wish to place something in the locker?
H-Hold on! You're not planning on putting\nme in there, are you?
Hmph... I don't follow your reasoning,\nbut I suppose I'm not opposed to it.
Hoohoo! How dark and comfy. All right,\nnow let me out already.
It locked itself. The door's\nnot opening...
What's wrong? No... It didn't get locked,\ndid it!?
Hurry up! Put some money in this thing\nand get me out of here!
Guess what? Shichi-kun's a great dancer!\nI hope you've got your phone ready,\nbecause I'm about to bust a move!
It's time... to dance!
I must apologize...
Oh really? Is that so?
Uch.
Okay, let's get started!
O divine power... Bring forth today's\nfortune!
Manifest, O divine power!
Yes, I've seen everything.
The overflowing desires... The light of\nthe moon... The piercing brilliance...
Yes, I've seen it! Today, you...\nYou have very good luck!
I'm sure good things will happen to you\nno matter what you do today.
Heh heh! Well, look at that.
My goodness... What an interesting result.\nIt seems that many unexpected things could\nhappen to you today.
Maybe you ought to head home and go\nto sleep tonight.
Be sure to come and see me if you ever\nwant your fortune read again!
Oh dear, this won't do... What ever should\nI do?
I have something to ask you. It's nothing\nterribly important...
There's a sweets shop not far from here.\nI heard they've started selling a new\ndessert.
I saw the dessert featured on a television\nprogram. It seems it's only available for a\nlimited amount of time.
I feel I must try it at least once. I'm\nhappy to have made it to the shop without\nissue but...
There's a long line of people waiting, and\nthey're all so young.
It's hard not to feel out of place eating\nhere as a little old lady all by myself.
I tried reaching out to my friends, but\nno one was free to meet today.
But now that you're here, {NAME1}-san,\nI can go in with confidence.
Would you mind accompanying me to the caf\xe9?
Oh, thank goodness. I'm so glad.
{NAME1}-san, order whatever you'd like.\nIt's on me.
I had tea with Fumiyo. She\ntreated me to the shop's\nnewest dessert.
Oh my, that was delectable.
I'm a picky eater, but I love cakes\nand pastries...
Oh dear, have I told you this already?
At my age, you start to forget everything.\nI hate it. It's very embarrassing.
Thank you for joining me today.
I'm so happy I got to try their new dessert.
And to think I'd get to enjoy it with such a\nhandsome young man.
When did I become so fortunate? I suppose\nthe longer you live, the more your\nluck improves.
Hehe. I'm sorry for making you accompany\nan old lady like me.
I would love to go to a sweets shop with you\nagain some time.
There are still many more delicious dessert\nshops in this area.
I look forward to the next time.
Today was such fun. I'll have to brag about\nit to my friends.
Take care, dear.
What a coincidence meeting you here. I'm on\nmy way to the bookstore.
No, there isn't a particular book I'm\nlooking for. I'm just passing the time.
You can find just about anything in\nShinjuku's bookstore. I always find myself\ngoing there.
Are you headed somewhere too,\n{NAME1}-san?
Do you need reference books for school?\nOr perhaps you're looking for comic books\nand novels?
Oh, I have an idea. Would you like to\naccompany me to the bookstore?
I'm very curious what young people are\nreading these days.
Wonderful! Let's head over.
Finding a good book is like meeting a\nspecial new friend.
I wonder what kind of plants we'll run into\ntoday. I can't wait!
Fumiyo and I chatted while\nbrowsing the books together.
That was fun. Thank you for coming with me.
Fumiyo bought something from\nthe academic section.
It looks pretty complicated...
Ah, are you curious about this book?
An interesting piece of text caught my eye\nwhile flipping through the pages.
The wording was very profound. I want to\nuse some of it in my next exhibition.
I think I'd like to use it for my\ncalligraphy classes as well.
The subject matter is very complex, so I\ncan't soak it all in in one day, but...
If I read a little every day and think over\nthe meaning, I'll finish it sooner or later.
No matter how old you get, you can always\nlearn something new.
"A day of study, treasured for millennia\nA century of wealth, squandered in a morning"
"A book is a blessing, worth more than jewels\nThe wisdom of a word, more precious than gold"
That's a poem I adore. It means what you\ngain from study and books is\nincredibly valuable.
But listen to me preaching to the choir. As\na full-time student you must know that better\nthan anyone.
Coming from someone at my age, it's hard to\nkeep advice from sounding preachy.
Perhaps older people try to impart wisdom to\nreclaim the time they lost making mistakes\nby giving it back to others.
I hope you don't mind my ramblings.
I'm grateful you've been so kind as to lend\nan ear, {NAME1}-san.
Today has been lovely Thank you for such a\nwonderful time.
I hope to see you again when you have the\ntime. Until then, take care.
I was in the middle of my walk, but I'm\njust about to take a short break.
Are you free now, {NAME1}-san?
Walking through a vibrant city like this\nalways makes me feel energized.
But compared to other people, I'm a bit of\na slow walker.
I walk on the edge of the road like this to\navoid blocking people that are in a rush.
It can be fun just standing here like this.\nYou see a lot of interesting things.
Sometimes when I stop to catch my breath I\nend up overhearing young people's\nconversations.
I can't hear most of what they say, but I'm\nsure I've heard them use slang words.
The slang young people use today... I can't\nmake heads or tails of it...
At some point I started becoming very\ninterested in trying to figure out their\nmeaning by listening to conversations.
I can't say it's the most dignified hobby.
And it's not as if I can stop someone in the\nstreet to ask what they mean.
But it's a way to pass the time.
Ah, but, {NAME1}-san, you must\nknow their meaning.
Could you help me decipher some of\nthese words?
Wonderful! Thank you so much.
Don't be silly. This isn't a quiz show.
If you don't know the meaning of certain\nwords either, that's also helpful information\nfor me.
The people who passed by just before used\nphrases like this...
Fumiyo asked about the slang\nwords she wants to know.
I explained the ones I know\nas simply as I could.
Ahhh... So that's what it means.
I knew it'd be best to have a young man like\nyou teach me the words of your generation.
To become good at something, you must throw\naway your ego and willingly learn\nfrom others.
Hehehe. I should try to use the slang you\ntaught me next time.
Well, I feel all rested up from my walk, so\nI should be heading home.
Thank you for letting me talk your ear off.\nGoodbye, dear.
Meow meow meow...
It seems like he's telling\nme to follow him...
There's three shiny objects\nlined up... These must be the\ntabby's treasures.
Is he saying... I can choose\none for myself?
Meow!?
Meow meow, meowww!
He seems angry... Guess he\ndidn't want to part with it.
Is there something else?\nI guess I should follow him...
Three more objects... Is it\nokay to take one?
Meow, meow.
...Did I make the\nright choice?
I guess it's mine now...
He might have more things to\ngive me...
I should go and meet the\norange tabby if I have\nthe time.
Ah, {NAME1}-san. N-Nice day today...
Sato's standing there\nteary-eyed...
Hm? Do I look anxious? Well, I suppose there\nis something bothering me...
Ummm... How do I put this?
No! I\u2014 Well\u2014 Um... I suppose you could\nsay that.
Well, it's uh... The thing is... This is\nquite difficult to say actually.
It might be that I may have, possibly...\nlost my staff ID card...
But, no! You know, actually, it's not\ntechnically lost... yet! If I find it, it\nwon't be an issue, so...
Well, in short, I'm scouring this area for\nmy ID.
That may be difficult...
In truth, I've lost my ID countless\u2014 I mean,\na few times before.
Every time I report it, the entire admin\noffice glares at me.
When I imagine their cold stares on me\nagain, I just... *sniffle*
And then all the embarrassment and the\nlectures guaranteed to follow...! Bwaaaaah!
Is that all you can say!?
Put yourself in my shoes! Wh-What if you\nlost your student ID, huh!?
And constantly too! And then the student\naffairs office glares at you every time...
Doesn't that sound like pure torture!?
What if they even yell at you!? Might make\nyou want to skip school, now wouldn't it!?
Well, that's the very nightmare I'm living\nright now...! Uwaaaaah!
I can't take it anymore!
I'd rather resign than be reprimanded for\nlosing my ID again...
Huh? You'll help me?
*sniff* Thank you. In that case, let's check\nover there.
I found an ID card with\nSato's photo on it!
Ah! That's it! That's my staff ID!
What a relief... I can't thank you enough!
Now I can avoid the admin staff's icy stares\nand cruel remarks...
You're my hero. Now I can go to work\nwithout worry.
Well then, please excuse me. Thank you\nso much again.
Oh, hi. Care to join me while I take some\nmore photos?
The scenery looks all different.\nMaybe it's because you're here...
"Is something wrong?" Absolutely something\nis wrong.
It's another change... An unwelcome one at\nthat. Everyone's completely losing it.
Yes, it drives joy away and so on. Though if\nthat were true, I'd love to capture it\non film.
Perhaps I'll get the chance if I keep sighing\nwhile carrying this camera around...
I heard there might've been\nanother Menace-related incident.
A blanket of gloom has fallen over the city\nstreets as a result.
Indeed. Ever since people started talking\nabout these incidents, the town has gotten\nstranger and stranger.
It's like the brilliance is being sucked out\nof daily life...
Shimizu seems to be pretty\nsensitive to shifts in the\ntown's atmosphere...
As you know, I love change, but only the kind\nthat's magnificent and exquisite.
"If you look closely, even a dull, monochrome\nroutine is brimming with vibrant,\ncolorful change."
That is my guiding belief.
But I don't want things to change for\nthe worse.
I'm glad I have someone on my side.
I wonder how many people out there feel\nthe same...
Of course. If it's possible, that is...
At the very least, I want this camera\nto capture things that are bright.
Maybe I'm a little young to be saying this,\nbut the world's become such an awful place.
But you managed to create a new change\nwithin it. A hopeful one.
Seeing you has given me hope, in a way.\nI'm very lucky to have met you, {NAME1}.
Shimizu looks happy...
Anyway, sorry for being a downer. Let's get\nback to the photos.
Okay, give me the most intense pose\nyou've got.
No, wait, maybe... Maybe a more natural pose\nwould be a nice change?
I haven't hit my change quota for the day,\nand I'm starving for a good one right now.
I get the feeling there's a change awaiting\nme near the station... You'll come with\nme, right?
I helped Shimizu with\nhis photography...
Hey, friend! Perfect timing!
I just bought the newest issue of\nMr. Muscle Weekly.
Let's jump right in then. Which article\nwill it be?
Great choice! You really wanna grow those\nmuscles big and beautiful, huh?
When bulgin' muscles ripple, they look cute\nas a purrin' kitten.
Biceps, pecs, quads... What muscles are we\npumpin' today?
Ah, what do we have here?\nA new training method!
My muscles are tremblin'.\nThey're screamin' for that pump!
Coconut Kato is my hero.\nHe's the best bodybuilder out there!
His essays are chock full of training tips,\nbut he also talks about his daily routine.
I love when he writes about his cheat day\nmeals. Just readin' it makes me drool!
I even promised myself I'd eat the same meals\non my cheat days!
Wonder what he's got to say this week.\nCan't wait to find out!
You must be quite the connoisseur to wanna\nread this first! I'm impressed.
I'm lookin' forward to it too. I wonder\nhow much weight the hero's gonna bench\nthis week!
Can't forget to mention his rival too!
The arm-wrestling contest story is a total\nclassic. I still have that issue at home.
Well, let's see what they're up to this week.\nMy hands are sweatin' just turnin' the page!
Anderson and I read magazines\nfor a while...
Great! This week's issue had lots of\nawesome info.
How 'bout it, friend?\nWanna put it to the test?
Let's go to the gym and see\nif we can't get some serious gains!
Okay! Let's get a move on! The training\nmachines are callin' our names!
I went to the gym with\nAnderson and worked hard on my\nstrength training...
Hey there, {NAME2}!\nHankerin' for some yakitori?
You got it!
This here's our skewer of the day.\nGo on, give it a try.
So? What'd you think?
That's real kind of you!
Any yakitori man worth his salt cares about\ningredients. In fact, I tweak our salt\nand tare seasonings daily.
Just little adjustments, based on\nthe weather, temperature, and humidity.
I put a lot a thought into every kebab.\nAll to hear customers like you say\n"it's tasty!"
You noticed? Very impressive, {NAME2}!
I adjust the seasoning each day based on\nthe weather and temperature outside.
That means the flavor of our food\nchanges on the daily.
What we humans think is tasty changes\ndependin' on how the day's goin'.
So this is my way of makin' our yakitori\nextra special.
Not the only way though. I've got a few\ntricks when it comes to grillin' too.
I've even got my regular's preferences down.\nFor example, Yama-san over there\nlikes it crispy!
All that to say, the yakitori each of\nmy customers eat...
...is different in its own special way!\nBut that's not all...
Tanzo looks so happy when he\ntalks about yakitori...
I ended up talking with him\nabout yakitori for a while.
I just ran out of protein.
Was thinkin' I'd go buy some more.\nWanna come with?
So there's lots of different kinds of\nprotein. Which one are you feelin' today?
Right on! There's lots of flavors, and it's\neasy to get all the nutrients you need.
Do you like yours with water, or with milk?
Water has its advantages, bein' zero cal\nand easy to access on the go.
On the other hand, milk helps you fill up\non calcium and other essential vitamins.
Both have their positives, so it's best\nto choose based on the situation.
I personally recommend unsweetened soy milk.\nGive it a try sometime!
Great choice! Unlike powder, you can carry\nit around and drink it anywhere.
It goes down easy even if you're not hungry\nor feelin' sick. Always good to have some\non hand.
Personally, I love that there're so many\nflavors. Makes it hard to get tired of.
Meals fit for serious sculptors like us\ntend to be lacking in flavor, you know?
Sometimes they go on sale at the drugstore,\nso I try to stock up then.
I know! Why don't we exchange protein jelly\nrecommendations next time?
Very nice! You know when you're serious\nabout gains like we are, it comes with a lot\nof dietary restrictions.
But when I find myself battling hunger,\nprotein bars are there to save the day!
There're several types of bars\nto choose from too.
Personally, I prefer the crunchy ones!\nI find the texture very satisfying.
But the wafer ones are good too.\nPerfect when you're only a little hungry.
So which do you prefer?\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!
Anderson and I spoke at\nlength about protein...
Oops, got a little carried away there.\nSorry 'bout that.
Let's get our shoppin' done before the store\ncloses! The proteins are waitin' for us!
Anderson and I went shopping\nfor protein.
Guess what? I made\nlunch today!
And of course there's enough for you too!\nWanna eat together?
That's the spirit, friend!
Aw, too bad! Next time then!
I woke up at 5 this mornin' so I could make\na perfect meal for you to try.
The secret to a muscle-buildin' menu is\ncareful preparation and precise portioning.
Well, go on! Have a bite of whatever\nyou like.
Anderson's lunch box... There's only three\nthings to choose from.
Right on! Everyone loves chicken breast.\nDefinitely the best place to start.
Naturally, I removed the skin to reduce\nthe fat content.
But it's kind of bland if you just boil it\nin salt, right?
So this time I added pickled plum and shiso.\nGotta keep the taste interesting so you\ndon't get tired of it, you know?
And it's important not to overcook it so the\nmeat doesn't dry out!
Startin' with veggies is the way to go!\nYou really know what you're doin'.
Broccoli is rich in vitamins, and a great\nsource of protein. It's definitely my\nveggie of choice!
Unfortunately, it loses a lot of its\nnutrients when you boil it.
I recommend steamin' it instead. That way\nthe nutrients can't escape.
You can grill it too, but it's tough to\ncontrol the precise amount of heat, so you\nhave to be careful!
Good eye! That's an egg white omelette.
The focus here is protein and potassium.\nThese pure egg whites are bound to turn in\nto pure muscle.
I put my own twist on it with baby sardines.\nThe saltiness adds a nice flavor.
Sure with the white eggs and the white fish\nit looks a bit... white. But you know,\nit's more uniform that way!
And the texture's surprisingly close to a\nregular omelette. Go on, give it a try!
Well? What'd you think?
I'll cook it again if you want. I hope\nyou'll eat your fill when I do!
I thoroughly enjoyed\nAnderson's home-cooked lunch.
And you're holding the bass\nperfectly already.
All right, let's jam. Don't worry,\nI'll give you cues.
Good job. Let's stop here for today.
It's best to ease into practicing\nas a beginner.
Our club motto is "have fun\nand take it easy," after all.
You're here again, {NAME1}-kun!\nYou're pretty dedicated, huh?
Your bass skills are improving\nsignificantly too. Can't let myself\nfall behind!
All right, let's jam!
Great work! We finished everything\nI had planned for rehearsal today,\nso let's wrap up.
You're keeping up well, {NAME1}-kun.\nI think you have a talent for music.
I'm so glad you joined our club, {NAME1}-kun!\nSee you next practice.
Are you ready, {NAME2}-kun?
Tsurumi and Taiko are rearing to go!\nI am too, of course.
All right, we're all set. Let's hit it!
Great work. Let's wrap up for today.\nThat was kind of tiring.
Oh, by the way...
Mr. Higashino said he'd leave out some\nsnacks for when we want to take a breather.
All right, let's eat some sweets\nand charge up for tomorrow!
Hey, {NAME2}-kun. Thanks for\ncoming today.
I can't believe we finally get to perform\nin a competition.
I hope we place well. On that note, let's\nstart practice!
Good work, {NAME2}-kun.\nHow's it going on bass?
If you have any questions about the sheet\nmusic, feel free to ask me.
Oh, school's almost over. Wanna head to the\nstation together?
{NAME2}-kun! Glad you're here!\nThink that makes everyone, right?
The competition is soon, so we're all\npretty fired up!
I'm so excited. I feel like today's gonna be\nour best rehearsal yet!
Good job, {NAME2}-kun. That was so fun!
Are you free after this? We were talking\nabout grabbing dinner before heading home.
Want to come with us, {NAME2}-kun?\nTsurumi says she knows a really good spot!
Hey, {NAME1}-kun! Fancy meetin' you here.
I'm on my way back from a run.\nAnd I didn't get lost this time!
Are you free right now?\nWanna shoot the breeze for a bit?
Great! Then let's hang out for a bit.
Oh, that's too bad. Later then!
The park nearby is one of\nmy favorite places to run.
Doing laps there really lets you\nappreciate the changing seasons.
Like, in spring the ground is covered\nin cherry blossom petals and gets all\nslippery.
It can be dangerous running on those,\nyou know! But the added challenge\nmotivates me.
The temperature changes every day too,\nso you have to think about how best\nto pace yourself.
Summer's a battle against the heat!\nIt's really dangerous if you don't hydrate.
I carry a drink, obviously, but it's still\nnice to know there are water fountains\nnearby just in case.
I'd also recommend a park with lots of trees.
The risk of getting heatstroke is lower\nwhen you've got shade.
The fallen leaves really alter the condition\nof the ground. They're fun to step on though.
But you'd better be careful of parks\nwith ginkgo trees!
The fallen nuts have a really strong smell.\nIf you slip and fall on them, it's pretty\nbad.
I fell on a bunch once... The smell got\nall over me. I couldn't bear taking\nthe train like that.
Winter's my personal favorite!\nThe more you run the warmer you feel.\nIt's pretty nice!
But the real hard part about winter\nis the wind. Cold wind really drains\nyour energy.
The cold wind and sweating combined\ncan make your body get dangerously cold.
So if you go for a run in winter, you'll want\nto pick a park with evergreens to block\nthe wind!
Seems like Komatsu likes to\nrun all year round...
But sometimes I even get lost in the parks.
I'll be running laps and then next thing\nI know I'm not even in the park anymore!
Pretty weird, huh? Maybe it's some\nkinda distortion in space and time?
I enjoyed aimless banter\nwith Komatsu...
I enjoyed aimless banter with Komatsu.
Mhm!
{NAME1}! You made it.
You're one promising rookie. I hope to see\nyou around more often than not.
We should get started.\nMake sure to give it your all!
Good job today! What'd you think?
I know you just joined, but I'm sure you'll get into the swing of things soon.
Make sure to do a cool down so you don't\nhurt anything. Catch you later!
We're gonna have a lot of fun today!\n{NAME1}You ready, ?
Let's get in some secret training later.\nThe others won't know what hit 'em!
Anyway, let's give it our all!
Great job! Sorry to take up your time with secret training and cleaning.
But all that effort's bound\nto pay off eventually.
Let's keep at it till then!
Hey, {NAME1}!\nTime for another fun practice!
The ball is our friend, but you and I\nare best buds!
All right! Let's do this!
Great job! You really gave it\nyour all out there!
I really appreciate everyone helping\nwith cleanup and field maintenance.
Oh, you wanna hit the curry shop today?\nThere's some new stuff I'm itchin' to try!
Hey, {NAME1}. Let's go hard today!
Huh? Oh, don't worry about me.\nI'm in tip-top shape.
Good job, {NAME1}. How are you holding up?
The practice match is coming up,\nso make sure you don't overdo it.
What? I should take my own advice?\nHaha! Can't argue there!
I should get going.\nDon't forget to do the cool down.
Oh, hey, {NAME1}. Let's kill it today!
I've gotta lay off the secret training\nfor a while to recover from my injury.
Agh! I just wanna get back to kicking ASAP!
Great job, {NAME1}! It's like you're\ncompletely part of the team now.
With you on our side, the national stadium\nis more than just a pipe dream. I know\nthat much for sure.
Let's get a strong one to perk ourselves up!\nYou know I'm talking about curry, of course!
Lately, I've been studying hard again to\nbecome a nurse...
Up until now, I've really only done the bare\nminimum in order to pass my tests, but it's\nstill so difficult.
but that couldn't be further from the truth.
Knowing this might come in handy whenever\nyou need to warm up your hands in winter.
Now that I've got your minds warmed up too...\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san, try answering\nthis one.
Exactly! I'm glad you understand. Full marks\nfor you!
in new ways like this or even repair\nand reuse them!
Hah, thank you for proving that you weren't\npaying attention! The correct answer was\nMrs. Marie Curie.
What's another kind of natural number\ndiscovered to have unique properties?
28! Its divisors sum up to 28.
There's still a problem I don't get,\nand I've been stuck on it for a while...
You'll teach me? I'll bring the workbook,\nso just wait a moment!
Umm, so this one here...
I helped Minami study\nin front of the shop...
Thanks so much for your help! How about I buy you a drink?
Perfect timing! I actually have a\nfavor to ask you...
Dad's still having back pain, so I'm going\nout to buy some things for our shop.
But it's a lot of stuff for one person to\ncarry... Would it be too much trouble to\nask you for help?
Okay, so we need tomatoes and green onions,\nand also some ginger and radishes...
Minami and I went on a\nshopping trip to restock the\nizakaya's kitchen...
Thank you so much! You really helped me out.
I've got to repay you somehow. So...
If you want, you could come over for dinner.\nI'll whip something up quick for you.
Of course, you're totally welcome! I'll get\nit ready now, so just wait inside.
Oh, right, thanks for helping me\nstudy earlier.
Thanks to you, I've been making some good\nprogress, but there's still some things I\ndon't get yet.
So, I was hoping you'd be willing to help\nme study again...
Oh... Let's not just stand out here talking,\nlet's go inside.
I just feel like there's still so much\nI don't understand!
So please, help me out here! Please,\nProfessor {NAME1}?
I've finished my backlog of\nbooks. Guess I'll check out\nthe bookstore.
I should get bonus pay by\nworking at the convenience\nstore in Shibuya today...

I've learned the secret to\ngood service. I think I can\nwork more efficiently now...
I should get bonus pay by\nworking at Hinokuniya\nin Shinjuku today...
I heard the bookstore in\nShinjuku has a book with tips\nfor convenience store jobs...
I heard the bookstore in\nShinjuku has a book with\ntips for flower shop jobs...
I heard the bookstore in\nShinjuku has a book with tips\nfor beef bowl shop jobs...
I heard the bookstore in\nShinjuku has a book with\ntips for cr\xeape shop jobs...

The bookstore might have\na book about the secrets\nof bathing...
The bookstore might have\na book about the secrets\nto film appreciation...
The bookstore might have\na book about the secrets\nto working out...
Kiyoshi Kurotani might know\nof a rare book that could be\nrelevant...
This part of town is lined\nwith used bookstores...
They sell books from a wide\nrange of genres here...
I bet if I invited a bookworm\nhere, they'd have a fun time.
The nature here is so\nrelaxing. I bet it's a\ngreat place for a walk.
There's lots of people riding\nboats on the lake, too.
Seems like a nice place to\nvisit with somebody...
This place has a really\nnice atmosphere...
Maybe I should invite someone\nI'm interested in here...
There's all kinds of art on\ndisplay here...
This place is really lively.\nThere's so many\nattractions here...
Roller coasters, haunted\nhouses... It seems like\na ton fun...
I bet it'd be a good place\nto invite someone...
You can get a\npanoramic view of Tokyo\nfrom this viewing platform...
A lot of couples are here...\nI guess it does have a really\nnice atmosphere.
What a quiet church.\nIt feels so austere.
I bet it's a great place to\ncome and think, too.
It might be nice to visit\nhere with someone...
I bet making monjayaki with a\ngroup of people would be fun.
Seems like a good place to\ninvite somebody...
I got on the Ferris wheel\nalone.
The view is spectacular.\nYou can see for miles...
Up here, it's just you and\nthe view... There's no one\naround to spoil the moment.
Maybe I should invite someone\nI'm interested in to ride it\nwith me...
There's a lot of shops\nselling unique fashion and\nhard-to-find goods...
There's also a cr\xeape shop,\nand their menu is famous...
Seems like a fun place to\nvisit with somebody...
This soup tastes incredible...
The noodles, the soup, the\npork, the egg... They're all\nin perfect harmony...
I ought to invite someone\nhere so I can share this\ndelicious flavor with them.
I went to Minami's house and\nhelped her study...
It seems dangerous ahead.
There's something blocking the path...
It seems this isn't an option yet. Let's\nsearch the area.
It seems as though this\ndoor won't open...
Hm... It looks like it requires a special\nkind of key.
It seems this door\ncan't be opened.
It appears as though it can only be opened\nfrom the inside.
This rail seems moveable...\nWe should see if there's a way\nto make it move.
This door looks pretty fragile.\nWe may be able to destroy it with some effort\n if we give it a try.
It seems we can't keep going from here.\nIs there any way around the back?
I don't think we can get through right now.\nWe ought to try something else.
That treasure chest... Something about it\nseems unusual.
What would a drum barrel be doing here?\nMost odd. Let's investigate it.
Hoo hoot! What a haul!
Another drum...\nLet's check it out.
It seems that Shadow left something\nbehind when it ran off.
Hoo hoo! What luck!
Keep going and I bet we'll find something\neven better.
There seems to be a crack in this wall.
Yes, just as I thought. Let's take a look\ninside of here.
It appears to be different from before.
While this structure may look similar,\nthe aura is completely different.
It seems that the entrance in Mementos\nvanishes once a Palace is destroyed.
Let's keep going. I doubt there's anything\nhere for us to see.
I feel as though Mementos is a bit less\nwarped than before.
Exactly! You really know your stuff,\ndon't ya?
These fare adjustment machines are dotted\nall around Mementos, so use\nwhichever ones you please!
Well, excuse me, darlin', but it's not just\nme who benefits from you usin' them machines.\nYou'd regret sitting this one out!
I don't really get what's going on here, but\nI don't feel like she's out to cause trouble\nfor us.
I'd be ever so much obliged to get a ticket,\nand I bet you'd be real happy to see this\ndistortion fixed.
I am a merchant, after all! Lend me a helping\nhand and I promise I'll make it worth\nyour while.
Things seem to have changed up ahead due to\nthat ticket we just gave the Shadow.
Let's go check it out, Wonder.
What's this? I can't ascertain the reason,\nbut our path is blocked by some sort of\ninexplicable distortion.
I say we ought to investigate.
Right. I'm kinda curious about what's going\non, too... Let's go check it out.
Wonder, something about this place... It\ndoesn't feel right.
These two gates of fog and the presence I\nsense within feel exceptionally unique.
Let me concentrate for a moment to confirm.
Hmm... I sense that this is the right way.
We ought to be able to go to the next floor\nif we proceed this way.
The other direction isn't necessarily a wrong\nchoice either.
Exploring the area and gathering anything\nthat could help us in our mission \na valid option as well.
You ought to be the one to choose what\nwe do.
Part of being a leader is making appropriate\ndecisions for the group.
Hoom? Hold on a second, Wonder.\nLook at that.
What a curious phenomenon... Perhaps we\nshould call it a whirlwind.
Hmm... This is merely speculation, but it\nappears to be a frenzy of turbulent desires\nthat have accumulated here.
They yearn to move swifter, to reach their\ndestination with greater haste.
This is their desire for speed given form.\nI'm sure you have experienced a\nfamiliar feeling.
Precisely. Why not test it to discern what\npower it holds?
Oho! At this speed, we're practically flying!\nLet's make good use of these.
Wait. I sense an ominous presence ahead.
The path ahead seems to have collapsed.\nWe'll fall if we keep going.
This is a bit far for me to fly across\ncarrying all of you...
Let's see if there's some other way there.
The wind here is quite strong.
A smashing success!
Hold on. I sense Shadows...
I can't spot any, though. It seems that they\nmust be hiding.
They can't obfuscate their presence entirely\nthough. Allow me to handle this.
I'll track down these Shadows by following\ntheir presence.
The door appears to be locked.
It is unlikely that we'll be able to break\nthrough from the front.
Perhaps we can unlock the door from the\nother side.
Let us leave this for now, and investigate it\nat another time...
The Shadows are after the treasure chest!?
What exactly is going on here?\nLet's investigate.
They're attempting to flee!\nHurry and catch them!
Agh... They've escaped. Let's endeavour to\ncatch them if we cross paths again.
This looks somewhat different to the previous\nWhirlwinds we've encountered.
I sense a stronger presence than usual.\nPerhaps...
It seems we are on the same page. You have a\nkeen eye.
I've no inkling of what this may yield, but\nlet's pass through it and see what happens.
Whoa! What's going on!?
I see... It has the same characteristics as\nthe Whirlwinds, but is more powerful\nand convenient.
I suppose we could call it a Cluster Whirlwind.\nWe can make use of these to rapidly increase\nour speed of travel.
It seems there's no way past... Let us search\nfor another way.
This kinda feels like trespassing...
We're not in the real world. Don't let it\nworry you.
Do we really have to go in this way?\nIt looks all wet and gross...
I understand your concern, but there is no\nother way.
We can only hope that no sewage\nis discharged.
Well, we're in. Let's just hurry and find a\nway out of here.
Hey, isn't that a bit weird? Looks like it's\nnot drainin' at all.
Hoom... That is unusual, but it's because of\nthat that we were able to get in. We should\nconsider it serendipitous.
There's the door... But how do we get it\nopen? I see nothing resembling a lever\nor switch...
There's some sort of device next to it.\nShould we see what it does?
I see... So we can use that device to operate\ndoors, it would seem.
The device appears to be battery-powered,\nwhich would indicate it requires energy\nto activate.
Energy, huh... Got a bad feelin' about this.
Hey, look at this.
This screen... It looks like it displays the\ncurrent condition of the dam?
Hoom... In short, I suppose this could be\nconsidered the dam's control room.
"Dam Water Level Abnormal", "Power Over\nCapacity"... Things do not seem to be\ngoing well.
Power over capacity? Then why couldn't we\nget the door open?
I'm not sure what it could be, but it's\nworth investigating.
It's a dead end. Could there be another\npath nearby?
Is that a Shadow up there?
Shhh! Quiet!
Energy transfer is almost complete. Should\nbe more than sufficient this time.
Is that the Shadow you mentioned earlier?\nWhat's that device he's operating...?
The operation commands are entered...\nAlright, let's get to work!
What!? Intruders!
Now then, let's try entering the operation\ncommand that Shadow used earlier.
Looks like it's turned on. Now what can\nwe do?
Absorb and release? What d'you mean by that?
Rather than a lengthy explanation, I think\na demonstration would be sufficient. Wonder,\ntry using it now.
It looks like the energy's been sent out.
Hoohoo... Now isn't that convenient?
If we find any similar devices later, we\nshould be sure to use them. Don't forget that\noperation command!
Is this a map? It says "Lower Level"...
I sense the treasure is still quite far.\nProbably much higher up.
It appears there's a storage area and an\nelevator ahead. Let's keep going, Wonder.
Whoa, Shadows!?
Hey, now, that's way too many of 'em!
Hoom, it's as Wonder says. I don't sense\nthe presence of enemy Shadows here.
Then... who are these people? Uh, if\n"people" is the right word...
These are cognitive manifestations created\nby the Palace ruler's perceptions...\nit would seem.
Right, right... So, what you're saying is,\nwe don't have to worry about them attacking us?
Think we can communicate? Let's try talkin'\nto 'em.
Hoom. I do suppose it could be worth a try.\nBut do be careful not to provoke any\nunwanted attention.
A fine idea. If we play our cards right, we\ncould learn something valuable.
Huh? Are you all here on a tour? Sorry, you\ncame at a bad time...
Say, did you... defeat those scary-looking\nguys?
Wow, you're amazing! I was too scared to\ngo anywhere near them...
But, if we keep working at full capacity\nlike this, the dam's likely to burst...
Seems we were able to learn something\nrather useful.
Yep. Just like we thought, the dam... well,\nthe Palace is in a pretty bad condition.
Hard to say... but that would mean this is\nMs. Katayama's Palace, then.
Hoom... But there was something odd about\nthe way he referred to Katayama as\nthe supervisor.
You're right. Standing around thinking will\nget us nowhere. We must proceed.
Guess we'll need some energy to open\nthis one, too.
Hoo... First, let us look for the\ncontrol device.
To open this shutter, it appears we will\nrequire two energy.
Alright, looks like that worked!
Huh? That door...
It's closed, huh? Guess we'll have to take\ncare of these Shadows to open it up.
Shoot... It's locked up tight.
I don't think we'll get in that easily...\nLet's come back later, Wonder.
Looks like this elevator's not moving.
So how're we supposed to go down?
We may be able to jump down using that cargo.
From this height? Well, I can probably manage\nthat, but what do we do if the elevator\nsuddenly starts movin' again?
That would be extremely dangerous. Let's do\nthis carefully.
Made it down safely... Phew, I was sweatin'\nback there.
It seems we can enter from here.
Going through the ducts is a very phantom\nthief-like method. Since I've made it\nthis far, allow me to go first.
Nope, no way! At times like these, let the\nboys take the lead!
Whoa! What the heck is this!?
You okay? You're not burned, are you?
It appears to be high-temperature steam...\nWe can't enter through here. We'll have to\nfind a different way.
Looks like there's a way through here. I was\nstarting to get worried.
It says we're on the mid-level. We'll need\nto go around to reach the next elevator.
We got this far. There's no way Akashi's\nShadow can catch us, right?
Huh? There's something on the monitor...
It's an alert for a temperature malfunction.
There must be an issue with the temperature\ncontrol system. It may have caused the steam\nfrom earlier.
There's a cooling facility on the map.\nPerhaps we should start there.
You've already got the hang of things, huh?\nYou're really somethin', senpai.
It's nothing, really.
It's the least I could do when I'm not much\nof a fighter.
You're a big help, senpai! Now, let's head\nto that cooling facility.
With this much energy, we'll be done in\nno time!
That bastard is still stealing energy from\nKatayama-san... You're done!
Intruders!? Let me at 'em! You'll be the\nones wiping the floor!
This device should divert the energy.
Perhaps we could use this device to solve\nthe steam issue.
Hoohoo... An interesting idea. Let's quickly\ntest it, Wonder.
Look! The steam's gone!
Whoa. Wouldn't have thought to use it\nlike that.
We can use this on electricity and even\nfilter out thermal energy from the\nreservoir tank.
So you're implying that anything with energy\ncan be filtered...
Either way, it's a great boon in this\nPalace. Let's use it to our advantage.
So this is the cooling facility... Those\nfans are huge!
But they're not moving...
The control room should be above us.\nLet's go there.
The water here looks really hot...
Better to keep away from it. Wouldn't want\nto get cooked.
The elevator isn't moving. It must\nrequire energy.
There doesn't look like there's any\ndevices around...
Even without electricty, there is another\nway to power the elevator.
What d'ya mean?
Correct. If the device can filter energy...
What other energy is there?\nI've got nothing...
Same... Is there any energy that we can use\naround here?
That should work. We can use the fan's\nkinetic energy. Very observant, Wonder.
Then that's settled. Let's give it a go.
It worked!
Nicely done!
This door also requires energy to open.
Wonder, you know what to do.
That went well!
We can get into the control room now!
How'd you get in here!?
You ain't getting past me!
The cooling facility is also in a\nconcerning state.
The high temperature seems to be a result\nof the main fan being broken.
We won't be able to get out of here if we\ndon't move it...
You're right... Let's go down the stairs...
Let's examine the main fan first.
Somebody finally came! I've been stuck\nhere forever...
Are you a worker here?
Ah, that's right. As you can see, the main\nfan's chain is broken.
To get the main fan working, we need to\nchange out three chains.
But it's dangerous to go out anywhere...
If we get you three chains, you'll be able\nto fix it?
Of course. You can count on it.
Got it. Let's look around for them.
Hey! I found one!
Well done, Soy! Wait...
The hell!? The chain just changed!
Is that a lighter? That's weird.
The worker won't be able to use that...
Hoom... Let's bring it with us. Let's look\nfor other chains.
Why's there a projector here?
Naturally to project something. But what...?
What's it mean? Should we light it?
No way. That'd be too dangerous.
Why not try putting it on the projector?\nMaybe it'll trigger something.
Now, what will it show us?
The lighter turned back into a chain!
It returned to normal after we watched\nthat film.
I wonder why it showed us that...
I don't know but we managed to acquire our\nfirst chain. Let us search for the others.
It's really steamy down there...
We could use the energy transmission device\nto filter the thermal energy.
Let's find the device first.
We can make our way safely now.
Great! Let's get going!
Of course this had to change too. This time\nit's a bowl?
Hey, isn't that...?
There should be a projector up ahead.\nLet's bring it with us.
Something like that did happen...
Katayama-san...
The bowl turned back into a chain.\nJust one more to go.
Stay focused! That'll have to wait!
It's just like before. It looks like they\nturned up the steam.
I'll leave it to you, leader!
You handled it skillfully.
The third chain changed too. This time's a\ncoffee cup?
Let's take it to a projector.
Try putting the coffee cup on the projector.
It turned back into a chain... With this we\nhave all three.
That took forever! Let's get back to the\ncooling facility.
You made it back! Did you find the chains?
Great! You found them! I'll get this fixed\nin a jiffy!
First this... Connect that... Right then,\nlet's try turning it on.
It feels cooler already.
It should be safer for us to move around now.
You guys wanted to get above ground, right?\nThere's still one working elevator.
There doesn't seem to be a treasure here.\nLet's go above ground.
This looks like an exit.
I cannot sense what lies ahead. It's also\nrisky with one person unable to fight.
Everyone, stay alert.
Oh, looks like we can control the robot with this!
Let's search this room first.
Traces left behind by Shadows, I suspect.
Wonder, perhaps we should search this area\nagain?
Any idea where the key might be, Wonder?
I feel there may be clues nearby...
Curses, that was the wrong order!\nWe've been discovered by the enemy!
Observe carefully, Wonder.
It's closed... It appears our path\nis blocked.
There's something peculiar about this gate.
Hoom... A fragment of a key of some sort?
We can't use it yet\nLet's search around for the remaining pieces.
Ah, that looks like it might fit with\nthe key fragment we found!
Excellent, this key should help with several\ntroublesome mechanisms.
There may be hints around here...\nLet's search the area.
Well, that took us outside, somehow...
There's nothing left to find here.\nLet's go back, Wonder.
The patrolling Shadows are blocking off\nthe exit. How troublesome...
Time to fight, Wonder!
All right, we'll need to gather information\nquickly, before we're discovered.
Wait, that's a Shadow ahead!\nIt seems to be blocking the exit.
We can proceed when you're ready, Wonder.
Let us continue after a short break.
Hoom, it seems we can use that key here.
Hoom... There should be clues nearby.
That's what we were looking for...\nLet's go, Wonder.
I'm sensing a powerful Shadow, Wonder!
The Metaverse Navigator is working again.\nLet us take our leave, Wonder.
A mechanism somewhere just started up...
Hey, have the intruders been by here?
No, I haven't seen anything...
I was sure I saw something moving...\nYou'd better not be shirking your duties!
All the water's gone now...
There might be some connection between the\nbox and the planks in the pond-bed...
From here on is an uncharted area. Stay on\nyour guard.
All the doors have been opened now. Nicely\ndone, Wonder.
Wh-What!? Wonder, be careful going forward!
Hoom... Quite a lot of enemies here...
It would behoove us to try and avoid the\nShadows on guard here.
I heard we have some intruders around here.
Make sure to keep your keys well hidden!
Yes sir!
Take care not to be discovered.
We may be able to glean hints from\ntheir conversations.
What've you heard about these intruders?\nI hear there's a group of 'em.
One female was captured and put\nin the Underground Prison, but the rest\nare still on the loose!
You there, intruders!\nYou're coming with us!
The front gate is open now, but we can't\nlet our guards down yet.
Look at the black paint on this one!
I remember Kamoshida's Palace having hidden\npassages behind paintings...
Is that so? Wonder, examine that painting\nmore closely.
The distortion here is getting worse...
Mewheheh, that means we're getting closer to the\nCore!
Hoom... Let's continue on then, Wonder.
Oh, look at that!\nThere's a grate in the way!
Kamoshida's Palace had mechanisms like this\ntoo, if I remember right...
Yup, sure did!\nWe had to pull the chains to get past 'em.
Intruders spotted!
Get them!
Yessir!
Hm? Is that...?
We've been spotted, look out!
Damn, door's locked... Can't go this way!
Indeed. Let's go back and think of another\nway to get into the west building.
The key we got from the Shadows seems to be\nfor the underground prison.
It's possible everyone has been locked up\ndown there...
When you're done resting, we should go to the\nunderground prison to rescue them.
So, we're back in the west building...
But isn't this whole place locked up?\nHow're we supposed find a key here?
We have to find a way to open this door.\nIf only there were any clues nearby...
Hey, fellas, isn't there something strange\nabout these statues?
Huh? What're you talkin' about? There's...\nWait, this one's got no shield!
And this one doesn't have a weapon!
Exactly. They're different from the others.
Maybe if we give 'em what they're missing,\nthat'll unlock the door?
There's an armory near here, isn't there?\nLet's see if we can find what we need there.
Oh, good idea! Let's go have a look!
This is the armory. Hopefully we can find\nequipment for those statues...
Jackpot! There's a ton of stuff here!
Time to loot this place!
That's got us two weapons.\nBut we still need two shields, yeah?
And this armory has... zero shields.
Guess we'll have to look somewhere else.
Look, we got shields here!
Shall we take these with us?
Whoa! The statue moved!
Shadows pretending to be statues, huh?\nGet ready to fight!
That's all the shields we need!
Okay, let's get back to those weird statues!
A door unlocked!\nI was right on the money!
Hey, you! What're you doing there!?
We've been caught!\nBetter silence them quickly!
Got it! Let's go, you bastards!
This seems to be... a key?
Perhaps it might open that door we saw\nearlier.
That'd be nice! How 'bout we take\na little break and then go back to check?
Let's not head that way yet.\nThere are things we need to get done first.
We'll be taking that shield off your hands!
There might be another shield here!\nLet's look around.
It looks like the gate came down!
So, there's no goin' back, huh... You think\nsomebody's controllin' this thing?
We can't be sure... Let's focus on\nthe shields and weapons for now.
You want to put the ball there?
All right, here we go!
Seriously though, what's with this door?\nWho the hell needs a door that big?
Ooh, I'm sensing...\nMewhehehee, the core's close, for sure!
It seems there's a proper order to this...
That didn't work... Why don't we reconsider\nthe pattern here and try again?
Blast, the Shadows have noticed us!
I'm sensing an enemy...
The armor moved!
It's been sealed off!
We can keep going through here, I think.
Yeah, now that we've made it this far...
The enemies ahead will probably be tougher.\nBe careful, everyone!
Look, there's something over here!
A statue guarding a treasure chest...\nThere could be something valuable in there!
The gates blocking off the treasure are\nblocking the exit, too.
We've seen this mechanism before, though\nthere may be new tricks to it this time...
Wonder, perhaps your powers of observation\nmay be able to spot something?
Nice, the gates all lifted!
This hall should take us to the first floor.
But we haven't got these weird-ass gates\nlifted yet.
Besides, do we know where this door\neven goes?
There's no telling until we find a key.
Hoo hoo! That appears to have been the\nright order!
This must be done in the correct sequence.\nWe'll need to learn the order from somewhere.
Yeah, I know! Anyway, where'd Joker and\nPanther disappear to?
Hoo hoo, a true Phantom Bond!
Yeah, we'll find them for sure!
Mwehehe, let's get going then!
Hold on, Wonder.
Isn't there something off about this? It's\nlike the treasure's begging to be stolen!
I don't think that's a good idea... At least\nbe careful about it!
What do you think, Wonder? Shall we open it?
Damn... We can't open it from here, huh?
Okay, let's try outside the gates, then!
We should be able to get in from above.
Let's head to the west building and continue\nfrom there.
We've arrived at the underground prison\nunscathed.
Hopefully we'll find some information\nabout our missing allies here...
In any case, our only hope lies ahead.\nOnward!
This door appears to be locked...
There must be another way around.
Why don't we search the area?
Wait, look!
It looks like Panther left behind a clue for us!
Hoom, so it appears.
There should be a clue in this cell, too!
But the door's locked...
Maybe the Shadows on guard would have a key?
Intruders! Get them!
This key should open the cell door...
What are you waiting for?\nTry it!
Wait. Shouldn't there be Shadows here?\nDoesn't their absence seem strange?
Now that you mention it, you're right...
We'd better tread carefully here. Let's scout\nthe perimeter, first.
Indeed. There must be something\nimportant nearby...
Based on the location of our previous clues,\nthe one called "Panther" may be over there.
Ah, there may be another clue over there!
This bridge wasn't raised before, right?
Are these footprints? Could they be Joker's?\nBut they just end here...
The door's locked... We can't go on this way.
Gotta go find the key!
Indeed, but there's no sign of a key here.\nWe should return to the west wing for now.
This mechanism seems locked...
But it closely resembles others we've seen.
Some Shadow in this vicinity\nmay be holding the key.
Should we look around, then?
Intruders, stop them!
Well that was exhausting... Perhaps a short\nbreak is in order?
I like the sound of that! First a break,\nthen the west wing!
But I have to wonder... Where is Joker now?
It looks dangerous ahead...
Make sure you're ready to proceed.
Hey, we make a pretty great team together,\nhuh? Let's keep this ball rollin'!
Keep your voice down, idiot!
Oh crap, I can hear 'em coming this way! And\na lot of 'em, too!
It'll be a pain if they find us here...
Let's go in that room and hide for now!
The exit is blocked by a grate...
Maybe there's a mechanism to open it nearby?
Very good, now we can pass. Let's go, Wonder.
Hm, there's a box behind that grate...
It might be useful somehow.
Hoom... The path is blocked.
Good work, Wonder!
Wonder, please search the area.
Perfect, all the grates are open now!
Now we can move to the next area.
Hold on, Wonder, I'm sensing a dangerous\npresence...
There might a trap laid for us ahead.
Well we won't know if we don't look, right?\nC'mon, let's go!
Hoom... There's another grate in the way.
So, you're the ones who've been running\namuck through the church, then?
I see waiting for you here has paid off.
You have quite the nerve, invading the very\nplace I stand guard!
Tsk... An ambush, is it!?\nPrepare yourselves!
We've dealt with the lackeys. Now for their\ncommander.
Bold move, but you're not getting through!
The grate's been lifted now!
It was quite the endeavor, but we've made it\nhere at last.
I hope that key actually works here...
Come on, Wonder, try it!
Ahead is the underground walkway to the\nTraining Hall of Love. Be careful!
Joker's not here either, huh...
Where the hell is he, seriously?
Huh? That thing over there...
Is that a clue from Joker!?
Joker might be this way, then! Let's keep\ngoing!
There's a Shadow blocking the way.
I suppose our only choice is to fight.
Wait a minute!
The Training Hall of Love has some pretty\nfierce Shadows guarding it.
We should take a minute to rest and get\nready before we go in.
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. We just\ngot through a pretty tough fight, after all.
Yeah, sounds good to me.
Help...
Somebody, help!
Hey, wait... Did you just hear someone call\nfor help?
I did! I think it came from up ahead!
Let's go see what's going on!
We heard that shouting from this way, but...
It's another closed door! Can we just kick\nit down this time!?
Hold your horses, Skull! That door's not\ngoing to fall to a couple kicks.
There's a lever over there, we can just...
Not move it an inch! The lever must be\nlocked.
No choice but to go find a key, then.
Back to keys again, huh...?
Whining about it won't help! Just get\nit done!
Well I don't see any keys... Where could it\nbe?
*giggle*
Mewhehehee!
What are you two laughing about?
Huh? Oh, there's something funny about that\nShadow over there.
My instincts are telling me it might have\na key on it.
We should jump it before it spots us!
Oh my! It really did have the key!
The instincts of a quasi-cat are not to be\ntrifled with... We should head back, then.
Looks like another new area.
I suspect there's treasure in here.
Let's make that treasure ours, then!
This's some kinda key at least.
The door isn't opening...
That's definitely a clue from Joker! He must\nbe up ahead now.
It seems we can get in from here.
Awesome! Now we can get going!
That Shadow looks powerful. We should\nmake sure we're prepared to fight it.
I'm sensing an enemy... Be careful, Wonder.
Yes, that's it!
If we pull that chain, it should raise the\ngrate!
But how are we going to get to it all the\nway up there...?
There's the hidden passage... But I guess it\nwon't get us all the way to the core.
This place is a little different from the\nPalace last time...
Anyway, let's start in the west wing!
Intruders! How did you get in here!?
We can't leave our post!
Forget about that, catch them!
From here, we'll be making our way along the outer wall of the castle.
Our route may not be the most steady going forward.
Let's proceed with caution.
Keep it up!
Wonder, wait!
The area ahead is dangerous, it would be\nunwise to force our way through.
We should find the balls and stop the blades,\nfirst.
The intruders have already made it this\nfar in!?
Very well... I'll take you out here and now!
Looks like this area's full of boxes.
They're even blocking all the doorways.\nWell, this is annoying...
Boxes stacked high, as well as a lone box\noff on its own... I see.
I recall a similar contraption from Kiuchi's\nPalace. Perhaps we can learn from it.
If the mechanisms are the same, moving the\ngreen-marked boxes into their correct places\nwill resolve this.
Let's do a thorough search and find them.\nI'll leave it to you, Wonder.
Hm? Looks like they dropped something.\nIs this... a baseball?
You know, Kiuchi's Palace had\ngimmicks that involved balls too.
I recall seeing an ornament like this in\nKiuchi's Palace.
Putting balls into the holes unlocked a door,\nallowing us to proceed.
Oh, nice! Then why don't we give that a try?
Whoa, what's going on here!? This is way too\ndangerous to go through!
We're all gonna get chopped in two if we\ndon't stop those scythes first...
You said it, we need to do something... Hm?\nThat round thing on the wall looks familiar.
Right! There was something like it in\nKiuchi's Palace! It disabled the trap!
Back then, we had to collect baseballs and\nput them in the holes.
We might be able to stop the scythes by\nmessing with this device too!
Right? It's got three holes in it. Maybe\nwe need the same number of balls?
Very astute, Panther. In which case, let us\nfind the remaining two balls.
Nicely done! That appears to be the right spot. Now for the next one.
You'll need to make some jumps here, Wonder.\nTake care.
Pretty big... and full of Shadows, too.\nCareful, everyone.
Keep it up, you're almost done.
That's all the box mazes solved... Let's move\nforward.
The area beyond here is unexplored territory.
Stay vigilant, Wonder.
There's a Shadow.
A strong one, too. Be on guard!
There's something blocking the door from the\nother side...
That seems to have opened the path.
It's locked?
Then I suppose that means we need a key.
Let's look for another one of those\nmechanisms, Wonder.
There must be more of those switches around. Let's continue our search.
These Shadows are quite the nuisance...
We'll need to defeat them in order to\nthoroughly investigate this room.
We ought to look into suspicious places when we come across them.
A key? There might be doors around here it\ncan open.
This must be the last one.
Shadow detected!
Stay alert, Wonder.
Take a look around, Wonder.
This hall seems to be on high alert...
Guess they're feeling cautious. They might even be guarding something.
That huge statue sure does get your attention. Don't ya think it's a li'l suspicious?
Aye... It does indeed.
But it seems there is no way for us to get close to it.
In a room this lavish, there's gotta be a lever or something.
So we're not getting out of here till we find some sort of switch? Okay, then let's get searching, Wonder!
That lever is terribly suspicious...
Excellent! We now have a means to get across!
We should be able to use it to leap to the other side.
There seems to be another scaffold we can use.
Let us continue to search for these mechanisms.
Try making your way to the other side, Wonder.
I have a strong feeling that we'll find what we're looking for just ahead.
This way appears to be blocked off...
Are there any mechanisms in the area that\nwould allow us to get past?
Excellent, it's open!
It's called the Book of Baseball... but it's\nentirely about Kiuchi's life!
This seems kinda sketchy...
Indeed it does. We ought to keep it in\nour possession, just in case.
What a ghastly tome. A m\xe9lange of lust\nfor the opposite sex and a desire to suppress\nthem.
A lot of girls' names are in here. Mine,\nTomoko's, and plenty of others...
It appears as though it's linked to Kiuchi.\nYet it's in this makeshift version of\nKamoshida's Palace?
Whatever the case, I suppose we ought to\nhold onto it for safekeeping.
The title says "Punishment," but... It's all\nabout Kiuchi shoulder checking people!
"Punishment"? All that coward did was\ntarget vulnerable girls!
It appears to be related to Kiuchi. We should\ntake this with us just in case.
Let's try again when we have all the books.
All right, then... Just one ball remains.
The enemy is now on high alert. We must\nproceed swiftly and judiciously.
Where do you think the last ball's hiding?
I want to say there was a secret room inside\nthe library in Kamoshida's Palace.
Yeah, there was! This place is just like it,\nso maybe it has the same kind of room?
That room totally had "we're hiding something\nsuper important in here!" kinda vibes.
I see. It's better to follow a lead than to\nrun around aimlessly. Let's go, Wonder.
Guess we can't brute force it. I don't see\nanything around that'll move it, either...
Hrm, it doesn't look like there's\na mechanism.
Drawing on past experience, the mechanism\nmay be located elsewhere.
For example, all of the bookshelves here\nappear to be missing volumes.
You're right! These shelves are missing one,\ntwo, three... Three books.
Line up the right books and open sesame,\nwe're in that secret room.
Hmph! You copycat... How dare you steal\nmy moment of brilliance!?
Hey, all I did was connect the dots! All you\nwere talking about was some old story!
Mewhehehee... Being a Phantom Thief is all\nabout making actual use of your wisdom,\ny'know?
Of course, we won't know if the same method\nwill really work until we give it a try.
Wha\u2014 An alarm!?
Whoa, that's a lot of stomping coming\nour way!
This is bad, we've got to get out of\nhere fast!
I sense a number of powerful foes...
Flee with as much caution as possible,\nwe musn't be found!
Hoo... The alarm finally stopped...
So, inserting an incorrect book must set off\nthe alarm.
We'll have to find the right books, then.\nOff we go, Wonder.
We'll find a path from outside the gates,\nand enter the west wing on the 2nd floor.
Not bad, Wonder, not bad at all!
Infiltration successful! Now on to the west\nwing. Careful, now.
The hall is full of Shadows! Powerful ones,\nat that.
There's a large number of Shadows ahead.\nBest not to approach them yet.
Well done, Wonder! Let's keep moving.
Now we can begin searching the west wing.
There are Shadows here as well... What do\nyou want to do?
Let's keep our distance and avoid combat as\nmuch as possible.
Watch out, Wonder, there's a Shadow ahead!
Well, that's dealt with. Let's continue.
So whadda we do now?
We've got to find a way into the west wing.
But there's a grate blockin' the way up, we\ncan't get through now...
I see... That might be worth a try.
It's a plan! Let's head outside!
Quick, find the intruders!
Huh? What was that?
Look down!
Raise the alarm! Trespassers must not be\nallowed inside this castle!
Capture the intruders!
It's a sea of Shadows down there.
Far too many to handle at once... We'll have\nto avoid fighting here.
While they're dilly-dallying around down\nthere, we can get into the west wing!
Oh yeah, we can get in from there, right?
There are Shadows quite nearby, though...
They haven't noticed us yet. We can ambush\n'em and take 'em out!
I see.\nWell then, let's give it a shot, Wonder!
Damn. Got Shadows here, too...
Better get 'em before we get got!
Yes, I think another ambush is in order.\nYou have my full confidence, Wonder.
Look, a treasure chest!
But with a grate in the way, damn...
The mechanism looks different from the ones\nwe dealt with before...
But there's sure to be a way to lift it!
Indeed... Let us search the room for now.
Curses, it's a trap!
You serious!? They got us surrounded!
No choice but to smash through 'em now!
Alright! We did it!
Stop! You're the intruders, aren't you!?
Oh crap, Shadows!\nWas that a trap!?
Excellent work, Wonder!
This door looks weird as hell, right?\nLook at all those \nhains.
There could be many treasures in there.
Good, one key obtained!
The grate is out of the way now, Wonder.\nLet's go through.
Somethin' feels different about this room...
Wonder, look at that!
But it's guarded by Shadows...
We'll have to remove the Shadows first, then.\nLet's get to it, Wonder!
Nicely done, Wonder.\nWell then, let's see what's inside.
Aw yeah, here we go!
Get your butts back in gear and go!
Take the lead, Wonder.
The mechanism is locked.\nSeems we can't get in right now.
Looks like we can get through here!
Let's keep it up, everybody!
Good, the grate blocking the door is open.
With the fire out, we can open the treasure\nchest up there now!
Wonder, look out!\nThe fire is still burning here!
The Shadow dropped a key... Say, ain't this\na dungeon key?
They said they'd caught a girl, too...\nIt might be Panther!
Really!? We'd better go save her\nright away, then!
Is this... a treasure chest key?
Excellent. Let's go claim some riches!
I hear Shadows speaking up ahead.\nWe may have to fight if we continue forward.
If we use this, we may be able to get\nall the way over there!
Let's take a look at the mechanism.
My word! That path lead to a place like this?
I knew there was a hidden passage here!
Hm, this room has a strange mechanism...
I can't yet predict what it might do.\nLet's explore with caution.
Blast it... The floor is rising!
What a layout...\nSure looks a lot like Kamoshida's Palace.
If we can't go through here, we'll have to go\nand search someplace else.
Someplace else? Like where, the west\nbuilding?
I guess we might as well head back, then.
Tch... There's a Shadow guarding that\ntreasure chest...
We'll need to fight it if we want the spoils.
Wonder, would you care to do the honors?
Try listening to what that Shadow is saying, Wonder.
You gotta give this your all...
Huh, he's the kinda guy that's always talking to\nhimself when he's doing stuff? I do that.
Although to me, it sounds like he's\npractically begging us to come steal the book\nright now.
Exactly. That's what us Phantom Thieves do.
Huh!? Hold on, you must be intruders!
We've been noticed. Let's go, Wonder!
This is what that guard just now must have been trying to protect.
Wait... The "Book of Domination"?
The name sounds familiar somehow...
That puts all three books in our possession.
That sure was a lotta work for\nthree shabby books...
It's probably because of how close we are\nto the core.
There are more Shadows around,\nand thedistortions are getting much worse...
So, this is the last area, then...\nBetter steel ourselves for the last stretch!
All that's left is to solve the mechanism inside the bookshelves.
Would you like to head straight back there now, Wonder?
Whoa, the bookshelf moved by itself! It's\nlike we're in a detective novel or something!
There appears to be a room ahead.
Our last ball's probably in there! C'mon,\nlet's go get it!
Ah... So that's how it's going to be.
Eh, I guess this much was to be expected.
This is as far as you go, filthy intruders!
Here they come! Prepare yourselves!
That's the third one! We did it!
Yes, this should be able to stop that scythe.
Alright, let's head back there!
Let's begin by scouring this library.
How about we head to the library first?
Palace libraries usually have some kind of\nsecret hiding inside them.
Weeell, back when we were at Kamoshida's Palace, some of the books we needed weren't in the same room.
Very good! It seems you got it right!
There are more of these mechanisms around\nhere. Stay calm and deal with them\none at a time.
I don't think there are any more books in this\narea. Let's go somewhere else!
A Shadow is near! Stay vigilant, Wonder!
Keep your distance and try to avoid combat.
This hall's more like a tunnel...
We'll have to deal with this area before we\ncan find the last ball.
Yellow and green boxes, huh.
Observe them carefully, and see what happens.
The green boxes disappeared and the yellow ones fell down!
Very well, then. We'll return to the library.
Exactly. It was a huge pain going around\nlooking for them!
In that case, let us search this place for\nthose books as well.
I see.... So that means we might have to\nextend our search beyond here?
Nice! The other grate closed, too!
Good work, Wonder. Now we can investigate\nthis area.
That's the last Shadow. Now we can get the\ninformation we need.
There seem to be other anniversary albums.\nShall we keep searching?
That's all the anniversary albums here...
There are anniversary albums here. We need to\nsearch for them.
These ducts are tighter than I expected...
I see, we can get in this way! Very clever!
It appears we can get through now.
Well done, Wonder. Now let's check behind\nthe painting.
It looks like some of the sensors are\ndeactivated. We may be able to proceed.
Well done, Wonder.
Brilliantly executed.
You were great!
It seems you need a module to use the camera.\nLet's find one.
Those red lasers are all over the place. How\nare we supposed to get through?
You should know by now there is always a way\nto unlock these things. Let's investigate\nthoroughly.
Shadows ahead of us. It doesn't seem like\nwe'll be able to avoid them.
Wonder, prepare for battle!
Hm. I can't say where exactly, but I sense\nanother treasure chest around here...
Are we done investigating here?
It seems we've collected all the treasure here.
Shall we open the final chest, Wonder?
We'll need a password. Let's search some of\nthe nearby Shadows for it.
Wh... What is that!? Is it... a human?
I can't detect any distortion nearby...
Perhaps there are other distorted humanoids\nlike this one in the nearby area...
We won't be able to force our way in.\nWe'll have to find another way.
Agh... They've found us!
We'll be surrounded by Shadows at this rate!\nWe ought to pull back for now!
As with other Palaces, there's a good chance\nthe guards will have what we're looking for.
Wha...!? A drawer just popped out of\nthe wall!
Hoohoo... This is good for us. We can use\nthis as a pathway.
There's a Shadow over there. But something\nabout it seems different from the others...
Indeed. I have a feeling this will not be\nso simple after all.
Take some time to prepare before we\nengage in combat.
A treasure chest appeared!\nThat must mean we beat this area, right?
It appears so. We should return to\nthe vault's entrance as soon as we check its\ncontents. Is that acceptable?
Good. Once you get the treasure,\nlet's return to the bank entrance.
The elevator past here seems to be connected\nto the bank's deepest levels.
We're finally nearing the core...
I doubt we'll be able to return once we board\nthe elevator. Are you ready to go?
Where do you think you're going, Wonder?\nThe core is right in front of your eyes.
That painting's huge... Think we can get\nthrough this one, too?
No... If my understanding is correct, we will\nnot pass through it, but in fact enter the\npainting itself.
Hoohoo... That is rather curious indeed!\nAlthough I'm also quite interested in those\ntwo empty frames over there...
There is no point in stopping here. Let's\nkeep going, Wonder.
Ah, a treasure chest key.
Hoom. There must be a locked treasure chest\nsomewhere. Let's search for it.
Wait there, Wonder. It seems there may be\nsomething around this painting...
Shall we try exiting the painting for now?
It seems we can even exit via this painting.
Let's search outside around the painting.
Let us begin by investigating the building\njust ahead of here.
There is no telling what sort of enemy could\nappear. Stay cautious, Wonder.
It doesn't seem to be locked... Shall we\ngo inside?
Apparently this is the "special exhibitions\nroom." We ought to begin by investigating\nthe other areas around here.
Yeah, let's do this.
I remember this.
What's the camera from Miyazawa's Palace\ndoing here?
And those samurai-lookin' Shadows are here,\ntoo. Does this place have somethin' to do\nwith Miyazawa?
It's certainly possible, but I can't say for\nsure just yet... At any rate, we should\ninvestigate those cameras first.
It appears as though another exhibition room\nis hidden behind this painting.
Let us press onward.\nStay vigilant, Wonder.
There's some sort of switch\nhere. I'm not sure what it does,\nbut should I press it?
Hoo! The shutters over there opened.
I feel as though something is\napproaching us...
Tch... The Shadows spotted us! Everyone,\nget ready!
Hold on... Isn't that the treasure chest from\nMiyazawa's Palace?
It certainly does look identical. As I\nsuspected, this place does have some\nconnection to Miyazawa...
In any case, we can think about it later.\nLet's see what's inside, Wonder.
This stuff seems pretty normal...
Indeed. There may be similar treasure chests\nelsewhere, though. Let's look around.
Next is the First Exhibition Room... Let's\nstart our search from the first floor, then.
There must be a path that leads elsewhere.
Wait, Wonder.
These are... infrared sensor beams, it would\nseem. Touching them will likely alert the\nguards to our presence.
So how should we proceed? There does not\nseem to be any way around them...
Perhaps we can disable them somehow. Let's\ntake a look around.
The device has been switched off. We can\npass through safely now.
Let's go further in, Wonder.
The sensors are disabled. We can proceed\nonwards now.
Excellent work, Wonder.
Hoohoo... You are now quite adept at this.
There should be one more switch nearby.\nSee if you can find it.
Now all the infrared devices should be off.\nWell done, Wonder.
Who are you!?
Hoom... Seems there are still some\nenemies left.
Quite a bother... Let's settle this quickly,\nWonder!
It seems another treasure chest\nhas appeared.
We ought to check it out, Wonder.
This appears to be an exhibition room\non the second floor of the museum...
We ought to begin by searching the area.
So this is the security room. We should look\naround.
I found a laptop. It looks like it's got stuff about\nthe security system.
Hoom... Perhaps we can disable the infrared\nsensors with this.
Let me see... Yeah, this should work. We'll\nneed a password.
A nearby Shadow may have it. Let's get going.
We should search for the password in the\nnearby vicinity.
Hoom... To think there would be a switch\nhidden here.
Looks like the device is lowering.
There's a Shadow over there...
They may have the password. Let's go, Wonder!
Hm? There's a note here.\nIt's got some numbers written on it.
Hoohoo! Just as I thought. It may be the\nelusive password.
Let's quickly return to the security room and\ntest it.
Let's return to the security room.
Good, let's give this a try!
Looks like it all worked out!
What the hell!? A hole in the ground!?
Compose yourself. It isn't real. It's an\noptical illusion.
Great... All the exits are blocked off. This\ntime it's electricity instead of infrared\nlasers.
That complicates things... There must be a\nswitch to deactivate it somewhere.
Let's search the area, Wonder.
Wonder, there's a switch here.
We've been found! Prepare yourself, Wonder!
There appears to be a passage\nbehind the painting.
Let's proceed. Stay vigilant, Wonder.
Wonder, the treasure chest has materialized!
This place is a bit excessive... It certainly\nis a likely place for treasure.
Hoohoo... A thrilling undertaking for phantom\nthieves. Let's go, Wonder!
It seems that this door won't open.
We must find another way in. Let's search the\nvicinity.
We're kinda high up... One wrong move and\nyou're done for.
Well, looks like we need to go higher.\nEveryone, watch your step!
Hey, there's an open window. Maybe we can\nget in from there?
What shall we do, Wonder? Should we enter\nfrom here?
I sense the Core in that direction...
We need to investigate the area to proceed\nfurther.
There are many Shadows roaming about. Let's\nproceed with caution.
This appears to be some sort of lounge.
We're still quite far from the Core. We have\nfurther yet to go.
This painting smells rather peculiar.
Try using that camera over there. Perhaps the\nnew perspective will reveal something of\nimport.
We're getting closer to the Core.
We may uncover an exit to the lounge if we\nsearch the vicinity.
What a perfect location for an ambush...
Show them what you got. Finish them off with\nthat phantom thief flair!
Huh? Aren't we just back where we came?
It seems so. We must have taken a wrong turn.
Let's try another route, Wonder.
A new painting has appeared in the frame.
Hoohoo! A new route awaits.
Good. Let's get back to that first painting.
It appears to be a gallery. The exit\ncontinues to elude us...
I sense a large number of Shadows ahead.\nDon't let your guard down.
Let's begin by searching the hall, Wonder.
Just don't let your guard down.
There seems to be something nearby... It may\nbe worthwhile to search the area.
It appears there's a surveillance room ahead.\nLead the way, Wonder.
I sense Shadows inside...
Wait! There's something there!
Seems kinda violent... It's not gonna start\nsnapping at us, is it?
A bit of caution never hurt anyone. Let's be\ncareful here, Wonder.
We'll proceed once we're ready.
Agh... The hallway is being blocked by this\nshutter. Could there be some way of\nopening it?
The shutter over there seems to have opened.
We ought to hurry over.
We'll aim for the north side of the hall's\nfirst floor. Move out once you're ready.
Looks like a dead end...
There must be some way forward. Let's look\naround a bit.
It's so stuffy in here! Feels as though I'll\nrun into a spider web at any moment...
We're finally out...\nWhat a long duct that was.
Looks like the reception room.
It appears as though the reception room's\nshutter has been locked.
We'll need to find some way of unlocking it.\nCould there be a hint nearby?
Hoo... The shutter opened!\nWell done, Wonder!
Hoom... All of the rooms have been locked.
Let's survey the area to see if we can find\na switch like the one just now.
Wonder, the shutter over there just opened!
Time to search the other rooms, Wonder.
It seems the shutter over there has opened.
Hm... This room seems to be laid out\nin the same way.
Another shutter opened, Wonder!
I'd say we have the hang of this now.
I understand your awe, but this is all\ncounterfeit.
No amount of staring will make it real.
I think we've fully scoured the hall. Where\nhaven't we searched...?
Be on the alert for intruders! Keep those\nelevators guarded!
Agh, really!? The elevator just went down!
We were just a little too slow... We're going\nto have to find the device that\ncontrols the elevators now.
Sure, but this area's crawling with Shadows.\nWe still gotta move carefully so\nwe're not spotted.
Hm... It seems they've set traps along this\npassage...
Ah, just look at that. It appears there are\ntwo mechanisms over there.
Likely the type solved by pushing boxes\naround. The rest is up to you, Wonder.
Excellent job, Wonder. Let's continue our\ninvestigation!
Could this be the elevator control room?\nLet's see if we can find some sort of\nswitch nearby.
The elevator returned to the first floor!
This should allow us access to the basement.\nLet us return to the elevator.
Let's get ready to head to the lower level.
Pressing this switch should allow us to go\ndown to the basement.
Enemies may be awaiting us down there.\nAre you prepared, Wonder?
It's just as I thought... Let's make quick\nwork of them, Wonder!
Are you prepared, Wonder?
Hm... This underground area seems even\nlarger than I imagined.
Searching it will be quite arduous. Let's\nbegin by checking the area around us.
I sense more Shadows ahead. Exercise proper\ncaution.
Ah! That's...!
You ought to be able to judge the cameras'\nfield of view, Wonder.
Let us proceed with caution.
What sort of machine is this...\nLet's take a look.
One moment, Wonder. Let's take a look\nat the device over there first.
Is this the power source\nfor some kind of device?
It says "camera" on it...\nCouldn't this be the power source\nfor the surveillance cameras?
For real!? Then let's smash it up already!
That seems to have gone well.
Nice! We won't need to worry about any\nsecurity cameras now.
A job well done, Wonder!
Wonder, we can't get through this way!
We need to investigate first.
Remarkable dexterity, Wonder.
The path is blocked...\nShall we look for another way?
Then what're we supposed to do?
Hoom... That seems to be our only option.
Roger that. Then let's find these things\nalready.
Okay, that's the last one!
The security cameras have been neutralized.\nLet's proceed, Wonder.
That Shadow over there...
It may be holding onto the keycard.\nLet's go!
Well that's sorted.
Hm? That Shadow drop somethin'?
A keycard. Just as I expected. We should\nbe able to use this somewhere nearby.
Is this the device? Let's give that keycard\na try.
It may even open other doors.\nIt seems well worth a try.
There's nothing scary about those\nsurveillance cameras now.
Looks like we have a rat infestation!
This place is off-limits!\nYou require immediate removal!
Hoohoo... It seems a treasure chest\nhas appeared.
Let's make haste and examine its contents.
The entrance to the security room appears to\nbe blocked.
Another search for a power source...\nWhat a bothersome location.
No point in complaining about it.\nCome on, cheer up a little!
Wonder, begin the investigation.
Let's be careful to not be spotted\nby any of the surveillance cameras.
What splendid wirework!
The path forward is utterly blocked...
We'll need to disarm that trap.\nLet's scout around this area.
The trap's been disarmed, then?\nImpressive as always, Wonder.
Looks like there are two rooms...
The electrical box must surely be hidden\ninside of here.
That should have neutralized the fence.
Wonder, let's depart as soon as you're ready.
The floor is littered with bills...
How overcome with desire is this Kaneshiro?\nNevermind. Heading underground comes first.
Another electric fence...? There may be some\nhint about how to turn it off nearby.
It seems we've managed to render the fence\nharmless. Excellent job, Wonder.
Now let's push on... No, wait.
I curious as to what's on the other side\nof that ventilation shaft. Why don't we try\ntaking a look?
Yes, it truly does feel like we'll find\nsomething here.
Huh? It's a dead end!
There don't seem to be any other paths.\nPerhaps there's a hint involving the\nelectrical box on the wall.
Take a look at it, Wonder.
There are security cameras here.\nWe'll need to proceed with caution.
Excellent. We can utilize this duct\nand continue our infiltration!
Hoohoo...! So you want to push through here.\nYou truly are the embodiment\nof a Phantom Thief... Heh.
Hoom... The security cameras here\nseem different from ones we've encountered\nthus far.
I can't spot anything resembling\nan electrical box nearby, either.
You're right. If I look closely, though...\nSomething's blinking on and off, right?
Maybe the cameras can't see us when it's off?
That seems quite likely.\nLet us time our movements precisely\nfor when they are turned off.
Indeed... But there surely must be a way\nin somewhere.
Let's continue our search, Wonder.
I see an elevator there, but it's being\nguarded by Shadows.
I concur. Let's make our way there.
How'd you get here!? What were all the other\nsecurity guards doing!?
Leave this place! Now!
Seems we have no choice but to fight.\nLet's go, Wonder!
I imagine the security will only grow even\nmore thorough going forward. Be on high\nalert as we continue.
So this is the underground vault. I see\nthere are quite a lot of Shadows here.
But where there is a vault, there is\na treasure chest. It's our duty as Phantom\nThieves to push on.
Let's begin by searching the first floor.
All right. Well done, Wonder.
I see... Yes, that does make some sense.\nWe'll need to find and destroy those\nas well.
Something's suspicious about that room...\nWon't you take a look, Wonder?
Huh? The door's not opening.
You kidding me? Man, what a pain.
We did it! This should let us into the\nroom back there!
Indeed. Let's return and give it a try.
The electric fence and the security cameras\nhave been disabled. Well done, Wonder.
This area is crawling with Shadows. They\nseem to be on rather high alert.
I think we ought to neutralize the security\nfirst. Is there an electrical box nearby?
The electrical box seems to be above us.
All right, we've taken out the security\nsystem. We should be able to\nproceed now.
Let's start by going deeper and searching\nthe area, Wonder.
Ugh... Our way through is blocked.
There must be some way to disarm the trap.\nLet's start by taking a close look at the\nroom over there.
That seems to have gone well. I imagine\nthere are other similar devices.
Hoom... All the traps in this area should be\ndisarmed now. Well done.
Let's keep searching the vault's second floor,\nWonder.
Just look at how high up we are...\nBetter make sure not to fall.
Another electric fence? How gauche. Let's\ndestroy the nearby electrical box.
Hold on. There seems to be a powerful\nShadow just beyond this door.
What shall we do, Wonder? Would you like\nto push on?
Come on! More traps? Just how heavily\nguarded is this place anyway?
It's only natural for the security to grow\nheavier the further we go. But we must\npush on.
You know the drill. We'll search the area\nand keep our eyes peeled for any hints.
Excellent job.
Now we can proceed. Well done, Wonder.
Splendidly done, Wonder! We've neutralized\nall the traps and security cameras now.
Look at all those shelves... I feel like\nI'm gonna be dizzy.
We seem to be on the lowest floor.\nStay focused, Wonder.
Just how long is this thing going to go\non for...?
We destroyed the electrical box, but...
Looks like our way's still blocked.
There must be more boxes. In that case,\nlet's find and destroy them all.
That must have been the final\nelectrical box.
We've disarmed all the traps with that.\nAre you prepared to move ahead?
Let's go back to the room just now if\nyou're ready!
But the job's not over quite yet. Let's find\nthe next electrical box.
That Shadow seems pretty tough...
It's guarding the deepest part of the vault.\nWe ought to assume that it's quite powerful.
I sure am! C'mon, let's do this!
There it is! Found the electrical box!
You're up, Wonder. You should be able to\navoid it all.
Our path's been blocked, has it? We'll need\nto head over there for now to disarm\nthe traps.
Search the area for a way forward.
Well done, Wonder. All that's left now is to\ndestroy the electrical box.
All righty then, viewers. Allow me to\nintroduce the next game!
First up is the heart of the challenger\nteam, Kiiiiing Robooo!
King Robo is what you would call\na master hacker!
If our challenger can safely guide King\nRobo to the hacking site, he wins!
What do you say? Are you ready? Then let the\ngames... BEGIN!
Oh my... It looks like an obstacle is\nblocking the way!
The one thing every hacker dreads...\nAn impenetrable firewall!
Whatever will our challenger do!? Only one\nway to find out!
What's this!? Yet another obstacle has\nappeared? An electric barrier, no less?
But it looks like our challenger has their\nown new gadget! A Self-Destruct Bot!
It may be small, but it packs some serious\nfirepower! Enough to blow up those barriers!
However, each time you use one gives you\nthat much less to work with, so use\nthem wisely!
What do you think, folks? Can our challenger\nrise to the occasion?
Uh oh! This new robot looks like a doozy!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? A robot that attacks\nother robots!? I believe this is what we call\na Berserk Bot!
With these Berserk Bots on the scene, a\nfiery Robo battle is about to unfold! I'm\non the edge of my seat, folks!
Will our challenger ride the tide of battle\nor sink under pressure!? Stay tuned to\nfind out!
And it's yet another Electric Barrier Door!\nTime to use a Self-Destruct Bot to...\nWait, it's gone!?
The challenger seems to be in trouble... But\nnot to worry! I thought this might happen,\nwhich is why I've arranged for a Secret Switch!
The challenger just has to move the robot on\ntop of the Secret Switch, and...!\nThe barrier is no more!
Nice and easy, huh? BZZT! You must\nbe dreaming!
The Berserk Bot will change routes now that\nthe barrier is down and the terrain has\nchanged! Keep a close eye on it!
But... how?
Greetings. I am a mind-controlled robot.
I did the thing!
We took a break and recovered\nour stamina...
I picked up the Book of\nBaseball and started flicking\nthrough the pages...
I picked up the Book of\nDomination and started\nflicking through the pages...
I picked up the Book of\nPunishment and started\nflicking through the pages...
I put the book I found\non the bookshelf...
I should come back\nanother time...
We have all the books for each\nof the missing locations...
There are still other things\nI need to do...
The position of the box is\nright, but the color is wrong...
We're back in the library...\nLet's try searching again...
We all worked together\nto remove the painting...
If I open this chest, that\nwill end our investigation of\nthis area...
We're back at the vault\nentrance...
I think I can go in from here.
There's a space between\nthe painting and the wall...
Let's check behind here...
There might be a switch over there. Let's\ngo have a look.
Seems like some sort\nof switch...
Let's press it...
A Shadow in the shape of a dog...?\nCould it be the guard dog here?
Maybe if we used the computer in the\nsurveillance room?
Yes, let's start searching the first floor.
I understand how you feel, but you'll need\nto persevere if you wish to continue being\na Phantom Thief.
There's a mountain of cash\nsitting on the table...
I don't think we've checked the basement yet.\nLet's look for a way down there.
It's not opening... It seems we'll need some\nsort of key.
Looks like a security camera.\nThe enemies will have their guard up\nif we're spotted on that thing.
What does this do...?
What is it, Wonder?
The cameras are watching our every move. We\nshouldn't make any unwise movements.
I say we destroy their power source like\nbefore to take out the cameras.
Yeah... We gotta do something about that\nfence. The power source must be somewhere\naround here.
Yes, we can finally enter the security room\nat long last.
This is just like Kaneshiro's palace. All of\nit must have been stolen from the helpless.
I don't see a way for us to go underground.
That just shows how important it is. I bet\nwe can make it underground if we take it.
Seems like that's not all of the cameras and\nelectric fences, though. Couldn't there be\nother electrical boxes around?
Seems that way. Maybe we need a\ndifferent keycard?
I got the Safe Keycard...
The room over there seems fishy to me.\nLet's go over there.
We're going to the vault's\nsecond floor. There are three\nfloors total, it seems...
It doesn't seem to open from\nthis side...
Look at all those blinking security cameras.\nWe need to find the perfect moment\nto dash across.
We made it to the\nbottom floor...
It doesn't seem to open\nfrom this side.
Doesn't seem like this is going to be an easy\nfight... Is everyone ready?
Making it there won't be easy, though.
Hoom? Where are we?
A... palace?\nNo, wait a second...
I sense a presence similar to a Palace\nup ahead, but something's... off.
As we discussed before, Palaces are the\nmanifestation of a person's warped\ndesires.
But further ahead, the warped desires\nI'm sensing lack a human's willpower...
As far as I know, this is the first time\nI've encountered anything like it.
What do you think, Wonder?
Oh? Very well. Then once you've\nprepared, let us head that way.
Tch... They have us surrounded! There's\ntoo many. We must retreat at once...
Oh my... What do we have here?\nI must be seeing things. Is that a\nhuman challenger!?
Say hello to your fabulous producer,\nBesa! So glad you made it all this way.
The show's about to heat up!\nPlaces, everyone! I want pictures\nup in five!
Human, we're delighted to have you\nonboard. We hope you enjoy the Robo\nChallenge at full throttle!
I suppose we're challengers, then?\nMore importantly...
I don't sense one bit of hostility from\nthem. This is quite the conundrum.
Is the stage all set? Everyone, one last\ncheck before showtime!
If we're all set, let's get those cameras\nrolling! The show's about to begin!
It appears that talking Shadow calls the\nshots around here.
We discussed this before, remember?\nMuch of the true nature of Shadows\nremains a mystery.
Like Marthym, there appear to be some\nShadows that are quite fond of humans.
And this space... I initially thought it\nwas a Palace that resembled a TV\nbroadcasting studio, but...
It seems it is not that simple. I don't\nsense a single treasure in the area.
Honestly, the situation is most\nperplexing. However, what I do\nknow is...
That they've welcomed us as their\nchallengers with open arms.
All right, challengers!\nPlease take the stage!
If we refuse their invitation, the\nShadows around us may react\nviolently.
For the time being, it's best we play\nalong. I'm counting on you, Wonder.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
The truth is, Mementos has been quite strange\nas of late.
If you have time, I'd like you to take a\nlook. I believe at least a cursory\ninvestigation would be prudent.
It may turn out to be nothing at all, but...\nif something were to happen, we best\nbe prepared.
This is... Hoom, it seems my intuition was\nnot misguided after all.
If my evaluation is correct, then this is...
A gathering place, for the Shadows of\nlost humans.
In fact, there has been a slight change in\nthe voices I hear calling out from\nwithin Mementos.
As a consequence of their desires being\nstolen, they feel befuddled by the choices\nthey make each day, major and minor...
I heard increasing voices saying they were\nstagnating and unable to move forward.
They feel anxious that if things continue as\nthey are, they will not be able to survive\nin modern society...
Therefore, their cognition has resulted in\nthe creation of this gathering place.
If we leave things as they are, this space\nwill eventually overtake all of Mementos...
Which, in turn, would have disastrous\nconsequences on reality.
So, before that happens, we must prevent\nthis place from expanding.
Inside this space, just like a Palace, there\nare powerful Shadows holding\ndistorted desires.
These are the Shadows of humans who have\nlost their way and cannot choose a\npath forward.
If we can aid them in making their choices,\nthey may be able to find their way again...
That way, the Shadows will be able to return\nto their human selves.
And consequently, this space should also\ncease expansion.
Hoohoo... But before we enter, a word\nof advice.
Although this is a special space, make no\nmistake, it is still part of Mementos.
Which means we may have no choice but to\nfight against some unusual Shadows.
I don't believe you have anything to worry\nabout, but still... I would advise caution.
So, we're heading into the Metaverse to\ninfiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today, right?
Indeed we are. You've both become much\nstronger, so I'm confident we'll have that\nTreasure soon.
Really? Hah, good to hear!
I gotta hurry up and find it... for Tomoko's\nsake too!
I'm ready to go whenever you are. Why don't\nwe drop by Mementos first?
*vzzt*
Hold on, this doesn't look like Mementos.
Uhh, Lufel? Where exactly are we?
I've hardly a clue myself. It's my first time\nhere as well. It's certainly the Metaverse...
A castle? What's something like that\ndoing here!? Doesn't look like it's\nKiuchi's Palace...
That big banner hanging there looks new\nto me too.
Hmm... This may be a space in the Metaverse\nheretofore unknown to us.
I know, right? Feels like something you'd\nsee at a school.
You know, like the ones saying, "Congrats\non making nationals!" or whatever.
Indeed. I thought at first that Kiuchi's\nPalace may have changed, but no...
Wherever we may be, vigilance is of\nutmost importance. Danger is surely\nafoot.
The fact that we arrived here in our\nPhantom Thieves attire is proof that\nwe're unwelcome guests here.
Wait, really!?
In that case, shouldn't we get outta here?
While this place piques my curiosity, you may\nbe correct. Fortunately the exit is in sight\u2014
We're unable to leave. Some odd force\nseems to be at work.
What? No way... So you're telling me we're\ntrapped here!?
That appears to be the case. We have no\nchoice but to find another way to escape.
I can think of no other option myself. Let's\nsee if we can find an entrance.
I sense something similar to Treasure inside.\nIf this is somebody's Palace...
...pilfering whatever that something is\nought to allow us to escape.
Sooo... I guess we could call it practice for\nstealing Kiuchi's Treasure or something?
In that case, I'm in. A li'l practice drill\nmeans less nerves when it matters, too!
We are in unknown territory, so we must\nnot let our guards down. Who can say if we'll\neven be able to find a way inside...
Heeey! The door's open!
I find it hard to believe that a such\na highly fortified stronghold would just\nwelcome thieves inside.
Perhaps it is a sign that others have\ninfiltrated this place before us...
Let's go, Wonder. But of course, do be\ncautious.
Tch... This is bad!
Damn, we let our guard down...
Huh? Hold on... Who's that!?
Other intruders? I knew it. They must have\nbeen the ones to unlock the gate.
Seems like one of them is human...\nThey're struggling against the Shadows too.
Whoa! Looks like we've got company!
Yes, Closer is still inexperienced in battle.\nAllow me to handle things here!
And who exactly are you!?
Another bad guy? No, doesn't seem like it...
Oooh, reinforcements!? Great timing!
Things were looking pretty dicey!
Hey man, thanks! You saved our butts\nthere. I'm Ryuji Sakam\u2014
What are you doing, idiot? Why would you\ngive your real name to some total stranger!?
I'm not a cat!
And who are you?
Don't ignore me!
Wonder, huh? You kinda remind me of\na friend of mine.
Are you okay, Wonder!?
Whoa, that's one huge cat!
I've never seen one this big...
Again, I'm not a cat.
Hmm. You didn't appear to be human from\nafar, and it seems I was correct.
Hold up a sec! Who're you to talk? What\nthe hell're you supposed to be anyway!?
Are you like... a bug-eyed lemur or\nsomething?
Who do you think you're calling a lemur!?\nMy name's Cattle!
Don't worry, we've all been there. Even we\nweren't sure what he was at first.
Yeah, it's not like I get what Mona is,\neither. I guess some creatures naturally\nhave googly eyes.
What are you saying!? Don't you dare lump\nme in with this guy!
Inexcusable... I can't believe you'd even\nbegin to think of me and that sorry excuse\nfor a cat as one and the same!
Nyahaha!
You've got some sharp eyes on you. Then\nagain, I think you'll find the word "cool" is\nmore fitting.
I concur. Some may appear more on the\ncute side when compared to my stately\nappearance.
Where do you two get your confidence from...?
Cute, you say? I take it you are trying to\nflatter me. Very well, you may hold me in\nhigh esteem.
Yeah, "cool" is the word that really\ndescribes me! Of course cute isn't really me.
Really? You've got weird taste, man.\nI'll say that much.
I accept the flattery, but I refuse to be\ncompared to the likes of him.
That's right! We're nothing alike! But...\nthanks for the compliment.
Anyway, enough about our weird friends...
What are you guys doing here, Wonder?
As for us, we got lost and just kinda ended\nup in this place, so...
Hey! You're giving away too much info!\nIn case you haven't realized, we've only\njust met each other!
Oh c'mon, relax. They were the ones who\nsaved our butts just now.
Well, yes, but...
We also somehow just ended up here. We're\nlooking for a way to escape.
Hold on, we can't be the only ones\nsharing information here, either.
I think it's fine. We're in a tough spot,\nanyway.
We might figure something out by talking\nto these people... If they are both people.
What are you looking at me for?
Hmm... Very well, then. It seems we are\nboth just as in the dark as each other.
So, we were trying to get somewhere,\nbut then...
We suddenly wound up here somehow.
Huh! Same as us, then.
Zip it, Skull!
What's the big deal? They're being open\nwith us.
So yeah, we just came here outta nowhere\nand entered the castle...
...but we ended up duking it out with\nShadows and got split from our friends in\nthe chaos.
There were others with you?
Yeah, two more. Just when we were about\nto regroup, we were surrounded by bad\nguys again.
Which is when we made our timely arrival.
Ugh... Look at this guy, running his mouth.
Fine. Guess we ought to tell you everything.\nSo we might've come here by accident, but...
...we do have an idea about how to get out.
Mmhmm. I reckon this castle is hiding\nsomething...
There's some kind of Treasure here, which\nmeans securing it may be the key to our\nescape.
Hey, you stole my line just now! What are\nyou interrupting me like that for!?
Well, it is the early bird that reaps the\nworm.
Hold on a second. So you guys know about\nTreasure?
Hey, that makes things simple. Plus, we\nknow this castle's ruler.
That's means we know our way around to\nsome degree.
Whoa, that's convenient!
I don't think that jerk would allow anyone\nto paint over his portrait like that...
Oh, so you know about Palaces too! So,\nyou're saying this place...
...is a lot like this Kamoshida guy's Palace,\nbut also has its differences?
Pretty much! You've got a good head on\nyour shoulders, er.... Miss Yellow!
Right, I guess I never gave you my name.\nI'm Motoh... Er, Closer.
Closer, Wonder, and Cattle, huh? Well, that\ngets the formalities out of the way!
And with that, we have successfully given\naway our code names and goals to complete\nstrangers...
Since we're all on the same page, why don't\nwe go look for this Treasure-like thing\ntogether?
What do you say, Wonder? It sounds like they\nstill have two friends to find.
Yeah, nothing beats strength in numbers.
True! Having more allies would sure help\nus out, too!
Cooperation, huh? Nothing like a little\nhonor among thieves.
We'll tell you what we know about this\ncastle, and you three can help us out in\nbattle!
Okay, we have a deal! Let's work together\nto achieve both our goals!
That's a huge help, thank you!
By the way... You know how you just talked\nabout this "Treasure-like thing"?
I don't wanna have to keep calling it that.\nHow about we give it a name?
I'm for it, but what would work?
Huh, I was just about to say the same\nthing! You're not bad, lemur.
I don't want anyone calling me that,\nespecially not some fake feline!
Heh heh... Well, I guess we have a name\nfor it! From now on, it shall be known as\na Core!
We'll look for the Core while searching for\nSkull and Mona's friends. Let's go!
I ran into some real trouble in the very\nfirst hall at Kamoshida's Palace, too.
Y'know, the same spot you just helped\nus out at.
What do you mean, real trouble?
Well, we got surrounded by these armored\nshadows and got the crap beat out of us.
We hadn't awakened our Personas at the\ntime, so we just ended up getting hauled\naway instead.
That bastard... Just thinking about it\npisses me off!
So you've been through a lot, too. You know,\nat times like this, I like to...
Those are both great ideas! Moving your\nbody does a lot to clear up your mind.
You... wanna work out?
I mean, I get it, but... I didn't expect you\nguys to be jocks.
Hey, I'll join you! Nothing like a stress\nrelief activity with friends!
Don't worry, you'll be fine. Just follow\nmy lead. When it comes to fitness, I'm a pro!
But what can we do here... We might have\nenough room for some quick sprints.
Don't I get a say in this?
I bet sprinting over there would really\ntake a load off your mind. C'mon!
*chuckle* I suppose we have no choice\nbut to run now.
I like Closer's attitude. C'mon, Skull! Get\nout there!
Gaaah! Easy for you to say when you're\nnot the ones running!
Okay, Closer! If we're doing this, there's\nno way I'm losing!
I must say, nothing about this castle is\nremotely appealing.
Isn't a Palace like... a representation of\nhow its twisted ruler sees the world?
Come to think of it, Kiuchi's Palace was\npretty odd too... it was a weird stadium.
Indeed. Other twisted desires must have\nshaped this place into a similarly vulgar\nstate.
Judging by the awful stuff Kamoshida does\nin reality, I'd hate to even think what evil\ndesires inspired this...
This place is disgusting. I'd like to get\nout of here ASAP.
Oh? Then do tell what your ideal Palace\nwould be like.
Let's see. A good palace would be...\nsomething pretty... something cool...\nwith Lady Ann there too...
Now that's a plan!
What am I saying!? This is no time for\nidle chat! We gotta hurry on ahead!
Wait, you're not gonna finish the story?
Talk about avoiding the subject...
It's way gloomier in here than it was in\nKiuchi's palace. It's like Shadows could\nleap out from anywhere...
Man, I wouldn't be surprised if we found\nstraight-up ghosts in this place...
Now that you mention it, this does kind\nof seem like one of those carnival\nhaunted houses...
S-Stop it! I'm not good with spooky stuff...
AAAAAAAAAGH!
Enough of that infernal racket! We must\nfocus on the task at hand!
Did you hear me? I said to quiet down!
Wonder, that includes you! Phantom Thieves\nare professionals at infiltration!\nYelling is...!
You got captured!?
Mona! Skull! You came for me!
I'm sorry, those Shadows surrounded me and\ntook me away... Who are those guys?
Ah! Look out, behind you!
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing!?
Thanks for saving me!
Anyway, where were we... Oh yeah. Who are\nthose people?
Huh! It feels weird to meet other phantom\nthieves. It's reassuring to know that there\nare more of us out there.
I'm Panther, by the way. Nice to meet you!
Likewise!
I have to say, though... What kind of awful\nperson puts a teenage girl in a place\nlike this!?
Heheh, it is pretty awful, but hey, better\nthan being tied up and hurt, I guess?
Wait. Has that... happened to you before?
Yeah. It's a little complicated, though...
I couldn't even begin to imagine what kinds\nof complications would lead to that.
Yeah... we got split up.
Well, I'm sure he'll be fine. Who knows,\nmaybe he's looking for us too.
Mewhehee... Very true. I can't imagine\nhim just sitting still.
Is this Joker guy your other friend? He\nmust be really strong!
Strong? I dunno if I'd go that far...\nVersatile, maybe.
Yeah, he's someone you always end up\nrelying on. I guess you could call him\nour leader.
Oh, so then he's like Wonder!
True! I get the vague feeling that the\ntwo of you are alike.
Does that mean that you often rely on\nWonder, Closer?
Of course I do! I mean, he's our leader!
Wow, he even talks like Joker... Could you\ntwo be twins or something?
Urgh, just ignore this idiot. Still, it would\nbe nice to find Joker already.
Hey, don't call me that!
I gotta admit, though, it's hard to keep\nmy cool when he's not around...
Right, we should go find him first and\nthen snatch the Core!
Man, this place never fails to creep\nme out...
Try being help captive there. It was so\ndamp and gross all around.
I guess Kamoshida wants to confine anyone\nhe doesn't like in a dark cell underground.
That guy's twisted view really shows in this\nplace.
Yeah, hard to believe just how many victims\nhe had... Ugh.
Hmm... This Kamoshida fellow sounds like\na human with rather fine taste.
Fine taste...?
No way! How could you ever say anything\nremotely positive about that horrible fiend!?
Please. I was clearly being sardonic.
Sardonic?
Sour tonic...?
Ooh, are we talking about soda?
Argh, is there anyone with a modicum of\nintelligence here!?
Agh... I can't stand this place.
Don't tell me, this was the place you were\ntied up, Panther?
That's right! What's worse, there was\nanother me here wearing a skimpy swimsuit...
You... in a swimsuit!?
Ugh... I get chills just thinking about it.
It must have been the form this Kamoshida\nfellow saw as his ideal version of you.
Which is to say that he saw you in a similar\nlight in real life.
Gross! Oh my god, he is the worst!
So he saw us boys as slaves... and you girls\nas his little playthings.
Can you believe a piece of trash like that\nworks at a school!? Now it's our turn to\nteach him a lesson!
Mmhm. We're gonna grab this guy's Treasure\nand make him apologize for everything!
Ugh, these goosebumps just aren't going\naway... Mona, let me get some floofy time in!
Huh? What're you talking about...
Wh-Wh-Whoooah! Puh-Puh-Panther!\nYou know we're in public, right!?
Ah, but... I couldn't be any happier...\nMrrreow...
At least all is well for the quasi-cat.\nIn any case, it's time for us to depart.
This place never stops being creepy, huh?\n"Training Hall of Love" my ass.
No way... Look at those girls! Let's go\nhelp them!
Calm down, Closer. Those are cognitive\nbeings, not real humans.
Oh! Right, Cattle told me about that. Still,\njust seeing them is hard to take.
What sort of human desires would give rise\nto such twisted cognition?
Like we were saying, it'd be hard to find a\nteacher more disgusting than Kamoshida.
He takes the volleyball team members he\ncoaches and... Wait, those girls...
They're not from our volleyball team, are\nthey?
Wait... No way! Tomoko!?
Tomoko! What's she doing there!?
Calm yourself. Did you not hear what Mona\njust told you? Those are cognitive beings\nwho\u2014
Even if she isn't real, how could he do this\nto her!?
Especially after the way she was hurt so\nbadly in real life...
Is she your friend, Closer?
Yeah, we're super close. But... this Kiuchi\npunk shoved her onto the train tracks.
She ended up getting seriously injured, and\nthat's why she can no longer play baseball,\nher favorite game...
That's why I'm going to make sure that\nKiuchi has a change of heart!
You know, something awful happened to one\nof my best friends too. It was all Kamoshida's\ndoing.
That's why I'll do whatever it takes to make\nhim have a change of heart. For Shiho's sake!
Panther...
Let's both give this everything we have!\nFor our friends!
Yeah! If these guys are rotten to the core...\nWe'll just have to cut that rot out!
And if that's our plan, the first thing we're\ngonna have to do is find our way outta\nthis place.
This doesn't seem to be Kamoshida's Palace,\nbut I doubt it's this Kiuchi guy's either.
But why would cognitive beings connected\nto Kiuchi be in a place linked to Kamoshida?
Do you really expect me to know the\nanswer to that?
If it's not Kamoshida's Palace, and it's not\nKiuchi's either... then where are we?
It seems this is no time for us to\ndilly-dally.
Hey, you! What are you doing!?
Agh! These are no simple foes!
What is with them? They're super tough!
Oh man, I think I'm starting to feel woozy...
Dammit, Mona! What are we gonna do!?\nThey'll just wear us down at this rate!
You say that like I'm not running out of\nsteam myself!
Wonder, no! These aren't opponents you\ncan fend off on your own\u2014
Allow me to lend a hand!
Wait... Joker!?
Huh? That's him!?
Think you can handle it?
Heh... Okay, let's go!
Whoa... You really beat them! It's like you\ntwo were reading each other's minds!
Seriously, that was unbelievable!
Why are they staring at each other like that?
Anyway, it sure is good to have you back,\nJoker.
For real. It's like you bring us together as\na unit. I finally feel like things're gonna\nbe okay now!
True. I guess we would feel the same if\nWonder were to disappear on us.
C'mon, you both even have similar\nbody language...
Forget all that, everyone's here now!
So all that's left is to find this Core,\nright?
Indeed. And I believe I know where it can\nbe found. If we just head there and\ntake it...
We'll be able to say sayonara to this place!
Ahem. I believe I was speaking.
Heheh. You're dealing with a phantom thief\nhere. Of course I'm gonna steal the\nspotlight!
Mrrraaahahaha!
Ah... In which case, I'll be sure to steal it\nright back when the opportunity arises.
Go ahead, I'd like to see you try!
I know these two act like they don't get\nalong, but I think they make a good duo, no?
You're in perfect harmony!
C'mon guys, we're a team. Now let's go\nfind that Core!
Hmmm? The ball seems to fit perfectly, but...
Nothing's happening.
Now, we have just one more ball to find.
Phew... I gotta say, I'm beat.
We've been on the move for a while now.\nI'd kind of like a little break myself.
Chief? Is that your owner or something?
Wait, is it even okay for cats to have\ncoffee and curry?
Hey, I'm no pet! And I told you already,\nI ain't a cat!
Mona's probably talking about the owner\nof a caf\xe9.
I hear that both the coffee and curry there\nare super tasty!
Isn't that right, Joker?
Agh... You talking about it is making me so hungry. I want some Leblanc curry too...
Really, guys? You're just gonna blurt out\nwhere a Phantom Thief lives?
Don't worry, it's just Closer and her pals.\nWe wouldn't be here right now if it weren't\nfor them!
And we promise to not tell anyone.
The same goes for you guys! Keep our\nidentities as phantom thieves a secret,\nokay?
Of course! Cross our hearts!
Ah! Another shield!? But we just broke the\nfirst one!
Should we really be attacking it? Don't we\nneed it to get out of this place?
So long as we don't destroy it. Show\nrestraint when you attack it.
Easier said than done, you know...
Listen, whining's not gonna get us anywhere!\nLet's do this already!
That's gotta be the Core behind that guy,\nright?
Just look at that thing! I bet he eats\nintruders for breakfast!
Looks a little creepy if you ask me...\nI don't know if it's a Shadow or not,but ugh.
I feel ya. It's giving me some bad vibes too.\nAnd I'm not just talking about how it looks.
The Core? No, wait. Is that Treasure!?
Treasure! Come to papa!
Whoa! Mona just perked up all of a sudden!
Perhaps the sight of the Treasure has whipped\nhim into a frenzy.
Though technically speaking, that is but a\nCore, not a Treasure.
Snap out of it already.
Ah... What was I doing?
Perhaps the Core contains catnip?
Again, I'm not a cat!
And what about you? What's an owl doing\nwearing that weird hood!?
Hoo!? Wh-Wh-What do you mean? This hood\nis hip! With it! The bee's knees!
Okay, you two. That's enough.
Grrr...
Whatever the case is, the only move here\nis to take that thing out and get the Core,\nright?
Let's do this!
It's ours!
Everything... Everything... I want it all...
Status, fame, dreams, wishes, desires...
I want it all... Everything that will satisfy\nmy heart...
What's with this dude? He's massive!
He changed his form to safeguard the\nCore. I'd say it's time to go all out!
Yesss! That's right, you're no match for us!
Something about that enemy seemed\nawfully familiar... But maybe it's my\nimagination?
Well. Either way, we beat them and\neveryone's still okay.
Go take the Core, Wonder.
Oh, I knew it...
Knew what?
We took the Core giving this space its\nshape. It's only natural for it to collapse\nnow.
Uhhh... which means?
This place is about to fall apart! Hurry it\nup, time for a tactical retreat!
Nice, we made it to the exit!
Uuugh, I'm exhausted...
I'm glad we managed to make it before the\ncastle crumbled.
With the Core in our possession, whatever\nwas preventing our escape seems to have\ndissipated.
But there's no telling when this place could\ncollapse as well. We should leave at once.
So... Does that mean this is where we say\ngoodbye to Panther and the others?
Closer...
I hope you get payback for Tomoko-chan.
Oh, I totally will!
And good luck with Shiho, Panther. I know\nyou can do it.
Yeah. Thanks!
Aww, having to say bye here just when we\nbecame friends is kinda sad.
Who knows, maybe we'll get to meet again\nif our Meta-Navs go on the fritz some more.
Sure, but that's kind of a scary thought...
Haha! I'm sure we'll find a way to meet\nagain.
I really hope so!
Come on already! We don't have time for\nlong goodbyes here!
We should also be on our way before this\nplace collapses!
See? I don't care what they say, those two\nare in perfect sync.
Thanks for the help.
Of course. Let's meet again.
Hmm? Hold on... what were we trying to\ndo again?
Right. We're heading into the Metaverse to\ninfiltrate Kiuchi's Palace today, right?
Why the vacant look? It's as if you were\novercome by a bout of melancholia.
Crown, grant me power...!\nMore, MORE!
My power...
How dare you! My crown...!\nYou'll pay for this!
Looks like we made him mad.\nEveryone, be careful!
So, are we heading to Mementos today?
Yeah. I'm still gettin' used to fighting, and\nI don't want to drag you guys down...
So I'll just watch you guys from the\nsidelines.
Learn? From us? You're taking this way\ntoo seriously! Oh wait...
Does that mean I get to be your coach?\nThat actually gets me kinda hype!
You're still quite lacking in experience\nyourself, you know...
Thus, I'm most suited to be your instructor.\nYou may call me Lufel-sensei.
Hmph... Who would you rather have as a\nteacher, Shun?
What are you two even fighting over?\nWell, whatever. I'm counting on you guys.
Whoa, where are we?
Hmm... This doesn't appear to be Mementos.\nSomething has clearly gone awry.
I'm even getting an odd sense of d\xe9j\xe0 vu.\nHow about you, Wonder?
Just as I thought... It's a rather eerie\nsense of familiarity.
Before it was a sort of medieval castle.\nAn imitation of a Palace belonging to a\nman called Kamoshida, I believe.
Kamoshida? Who's that?
I couldn't say. In fact, I'd like to know the\nanswer to that myself.
Yes... An imitation of a Palace belonging\nto a man known as Kamoshida.
Anyway, where'd Arai go? Er, I guess\nit's Closer when we're in the Metaverse.
Ah! Indeed, she's nowhere to be found.\nHow could it have taken me so long to\nnotice?
Maybe we were the only ones who got sent to\nthis place?
No, Closer was with us when we were sent\nhere. I can't imagine she's been left behind.
It isn't impossible that only Closer was\nseparated from the group and ended up in\na different part of the Metaverse.
Yes, staying here will get us nowhere. We\nought to begin by finding her.
Should we really be moving without a plan?\nWe don't even know where we are.
If this is anything like before, stealing\nthis Palace's Core will allow us to escape.
And given that we suddenly regained our\nmemories upon arrival...
It could be that certain other individuals\nhave come to this world as well.
Who're you talkin' about?
Other ones? Okay, I have no idea who\nyou're talking about...
Do you remember when I said that we once\ncame to a place resembling the Palace of a\nman named Kamoshida?
We met people who were familiar with it.
Though they were accompanied by a\ncompanion that one would hesitate to\ncall human...
So someone like you, I guess? They got\na hooded goblin with them too?
How dare you liken me to that thing! And\ndon't call me a hooded goblin!
What're you getting so mad about?
That's enough from you. Let's move out\nalready.
Hold on a second. Shouldn't we at least see\nif we can get outta here normally before we\ndo anything?
Hmm... We couldn't before, but I concede,\ngiving it a try would be worthwhile.
Right? Now, let's see here...
No luck. We're stuck here.
Hrm... It seems that we do indeed need to\nsteal the Palace's Core like before.
So you're saying that creepy building over\nthere is this Palace we're looking for?
Indeed. Perhaps our old friends have already\nbeat us inside...
Speaking of them, what're they like? Besides\nbeing Phantom Thieves.
I wouldn't call them bad, at least. Well,\naside from that quasi-cat.
What's a quasi-cat?
Well, I guess there's no need to worry if\nyou two vouch for 'em.
Those individuals were fascinating. They\nseemed to have... strong convictions.
So they stay true to who they are, huh?\nI like people like that.
Well then, let's start investigating that\nbuilding.
The door appears to be unlocked. It seems\nwe are not the first visitors.
Are you prepared? If so, let's head inside.
Wh-What's going on!?
So the unlocked door was a trap! How could\nI have fallen for something so simple...
We must run, before we're surrounded!
Damn it! These things are in the way!
Brace yourself, Soy! Defend yourself!
Wonder! Watch out!
Could it be...? Panther!
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. Please,\nassist Wonder!
All right, just leave this to me!
Fox, let's do this!
Of course. My blade will tear them asunder!
Phew... Somehow managed to make it out\nof that one. You okay, Wonder?
Hey, don't sweat it! Just returning the\nfavor.
Don't forget, you were the one who saved\nme last time!
So you're Wonder. I've heard about you. Yes...\nSomething about you does resemble Joker.
Right? Kinda mysterious, but you can always\ncount on him!
Thank you for your assistance. So, you found\nyour way in here as well. I knew it.
What is this inexplicable creature!?
I-Inexplicable!?
He doesn't look that weird. It's not like\nhe's that different from Mona, right?
Must I repeat myself a second time!? Do not\nassociate me with that detestable creature!
Oh, I take it this isn't the first time this\nconversation's happened.
Might those protrusions on your head be ears?\nOr are they an accessory of sorts?
What a peculiar look! Would you allow me to\nsketch you for a bit?
Hey, knock it off.
Oh, I guess we haven't met before. Hi, I'm\nPanther.
And I'm Soy. Nice to meet you.
You may call me Fox. I follow the path of an\nartist as I endeavor to elevate my craft.
You're on an artist's path, huh? I guess you\ncould say I'm pursuing a chef's path, then...
Wait, so you're a chef? Whoa!
Ah, how fascinating. What is your specialty?
Ramen. Well, I've had to quit my part-time\ngig for reasons I won't get into, but...
Oh, that's a shame. I bet Skull would be\noverjoyed to hear you're a ramen chef.
"Skull...?" Huh, so you have a ramen-lover\non your side as well.
Indeed, we do, but all this talk of food is\nmaking me rather famished. I've had nothing\nbut warm water all day.
Warm water...? Fox, is it just me or are you\nalways hungry?
Heh. You're an interesting guy, Fox. If\nyou're hungry, I've gotcha covered.
If we get out of here safe, dinner's on me.\nAs thanks for saving Wonder.
Well then, let's get out of here at once.
Hold on. We need to find the others first!
Hmm... From the sound of it, you've been\nseparated as well?
You guys too, huh. Come to think of it,\nwhere's Closer? Is she missing?
Yes. We were together before coming here,\nbut we are uncertain of her current\nwhereabouts.
I see. We appear to be in similar situations.
Guess that makes it clear what we gotta do,\nthen. Let's team up to find our friends.
Ultimately, whether we can get out of here\ndepends on if we can find the Core, which\nsurely won't be an easy feat.
Wonder, what should we do first?
I agree. Strength in numbers is the way to\ngo. Not to mention... thing's aren't looking\ngood for us.
We're currently missing Skull, Mona, Queen,\nand Joker. That's four of our allies.
I see. Closer is the only one missing from\nour ranks.
In that case, let us first find our allies,\nthen begin our search for the Core.
If we happen to come across the Core while\nwe're looking for them, we can just snatch\nit up.
You want to secure the Core first? That plan\ncould work, yes.
Aren't there Shadows here too, though?\nIt seems safer to have strength in numbers.
You're right. And I mean, I can't help but\nworry about the others who are missing.
Why not do both at the same time? We might\nfind them while we're looking for the Core.
Yes, that's a good plan. Now, let's revise\nthe details...
Skull, Mona, Queen, and Joker. That makes\nfour missing comrades on our side.
We're only missing Closer, so that makes one.\nAll right, let's team up and find 'em all.
It seems we now have a course of action, but\nbefore we get going...
There's something that I would like to share\nwith all of you.
I sense the presence of two Cores here.
I cannot be certain... This has never\nhappened before.
If there's two Cores, does that mean we need\nto steal both to get outta here?
While I can't say for sure... I believe that\nis a very likely possibility.
Hold on, how are you even able to sense\nsomething like that, Cattle?
For reasons unknown, Cores feel akin to\nTreasures; thus I can sense them as well.
From recollection, wasn't your quasi-cat able\nto sense Cores as well?
Heheh... Yeah, Mona gets super excited\nabout Treasures. Couldn't tell you why,though.
So nobody really knows why, huh? Well, it's\nnot important now, I guess.
Then let us commence our search from the\nclosest Core and pick up our missing allies\nalong the way.
Any objections?
If that's our plan, then we ought to hurry.
I do want that ramen!
Mhm. It doesn't seem to be the Palace we\nknow. Take these paintings... they're not\nlike before.
What do you mean, before?
The ruler of the Palace was my former\nmentor... An artist called Ichiryusai\nMadarame.
I joined the Phantom Thieves to give him a\nchange of heart... by taking his Treasure.
But I thought this Palace had collapsed after\nwe had done so.
So you are saying it resembles a Palace that\nhas already collapsed? And what makes it\ndifferent?
This place used to be decorated with\nportraits of his pupils suffering under him.\nLike me.
If this was a Palace, I suppose that means\nhe saw his pupils as his own blank canvases,\nthen...
A blank canvas... even that would be generous\nof him. Unfortunately, he deemed us to be\neven more insignificant than that.
Sounds like you really had it rough. You\ndon't need to talk about this if you don't\nwant to.
Thank you, but it's all in the past now.\nThe matter has been resolved.
When I lost my parents at a young age,\nMadarame took me in. Consequently, I felt\ndeeply indebted to him.
But in reality, he only thought of me and his\nother students as mere tools.
He took our work and called it his own.\nAll to gain fame and wealth.
What a piece of trash. He's like the total\nopposite of Pops at Heritage Kitchen...
I think I knew that somewhere deep in my\nheart, I deluded myself, refusing to see the\ntruth.
It was Joker and the rest of my friends\nin the Phantom Thieves who opened my eyes.
They taught me a lesson... That you need to\nstand up against injustice.
Stand up against injustice, huh?
Judging by your expression, I'd say those\nwords brought something to mind.
To serve blindly makes a life of easy work,\nbut can one truly be alive with a hollow\nheart?
It is only by pursuing our genuine beliefs\nthat the path ahead of us will become clear.
Yeah. You know what? You're exactly right.
I'd been deceiving myself as well until\npretty recently.
I told myself to stop getting involved 'cause\nall I do is hurt those around me. I... even\nended up throwing away my pride.
I really thought I was the scum of the earth,\nbut meeting Wonder and the others made me\nrealize something.
There are some desires you can't throw away,\neven if they affect others.
That's why I won't hesitate any longer. I'm\nstanding tall against injustice.
I'm not lettin' anyone else have their pride\nor reason for living taken from them!
Heh. Seems you've been blessed with good\nfriends just as I've been.
Totally. You can do it, Soy! I'm sure it'll\nall work out for you!
Thanks. I appreciate it.
Well, now that we've reaffirmed our resolve,\nI believe we ought to return to our search.
That's right, we need to find our friends. We\nhaven't even come across Closer yet!
By the way, was Closer able to get justice\nfor the friend she mentioned before?
Heheh. Perhaps you ought to ask her yourself.
Yeah, you're right. Okay, then let's get back\nto finding everyone!
Aargh! What're you doing!?
Enemies are gonna swarm us if you touch that!\nDidn't you just learn your lesson!?
Ah...! Right. What was I thinking?
Sheesh. Well, as long as you know. Also,\nthat's a Core, not a Treasure.
Cores... Treasure...
Meeeow! Treasure!
God, you just don't learn! Enough is enough,\nyou freaky furball...!
Huh? Wait, Wonder? Is that you!?
And Panther, and Fox, and... even Cattle's\nhere!
Hey, we were looking everywhere for you two!
It's been a while, Skull. And you, quasi-cat...\nI see you haven't changed one bit.
Hm? Uhhh...
You're, umm... Sorry, I can't remember your\nname at all.
Well, yeah. That's 'cause we've never met\nbefore.
Oh... I guess we haven't! I'm Skull, nice to\nmeet ya!
Skull? Oh, so you're the ramen-lover. I'm\nSoy. Good to meet you, too.
And... what's that thing in your arms?
Oh, this guy's name is Mona. How do I explain\nthis? Hmm...
He's a cat?
So, what exactly are you doing, Skull?
Seems something like a Core is over that\nway, but touching one of those red beams\nsummons enemies.
And then Mona went all crazy when he saw\nit. Man, I was stuck mulling over what to\ndo...
So, it's a sensor-based trap. What should we\ndo, Wonder?
Hmm. Yes, we are a large group now. Perhaps\nwe wouldn't have trouble with those enemies.
Yeah, true. Not like it's a problem if we can\njust take them all out!
I'm the last person who should be saying\nthis, but you guys are such meatheads...
Then again, I guess that beats standing\naround all day thinking of what to do!
Rightly said. How about we split into two\ngroups: one to fight off the enemies, and the\nother to secure the core?
Of course, then there is the issue of what\nto do with that fraud of a feline.
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you!?\nFraud this, feline that, I'm a real cat\nwhether you like it or not!
Wait, no! I'm not a cat!
Hey, when did you guys get here?
So, you've finally decided to snap out of it?
Good grief.
I know you... You're that lemur we meet that\none time!
Who are you calling a lemur!? At least call\nme a hooded goblin! Wait, no!
What is with these two...?
Enough, you two! We're supposed to be on\nthe same side, so quit fighting each other!
Okay... Anything for you, Panther.
All right. Let's pick teams. Everyone throw\nrock or paper.
Rock, paper, go!
Good heavens... I can hardly believe I am on\nthe same team as that wretched cat.
And you think I want to be with you!?
Okay, then. Team Weird Critters will be\nsearching for the Core with me.
Team Weird Critters!?
As much as I hate being stuck with feathers...\nIf that's your decision, Panther, I'm in!
So the enemies will come once we trip the\nsensor, yes?
Okay, then here goes!
So we just need to chop these guys up?
That's right!
Their blood shall soak my blade. I'm getting\nthat ramen!
Okay, looks like it worked out! The Core's\nall ours!
This is a Core...? It's like some framed\ncertificate with a star on it.
We ain't got time to be standing around.\nTaking it makes this place collapse, right?
Huh? But it doesn't look like the walls are\ngonna come down on us.
Right? Last time we got a Core we had to\nbook it right away.
As I mentioned before, there are two Cores\nhere. Perhaps that is the reason.
Oh, that's right. I could smell the presence\nof more than one.
So I guess just stealing one won't cause this\nplace to collapse?
That just means we'll have to find this other\nCore.
Ah... But that means putting my ramen on\nhold!
Hey, did you just say ramen?
Okay, out with it. I need details!
Oh, yeah. I promised to make him ramen as\nthanks for saving Wonder.
Seriously? Like you're gonna make it from\nscratch!?
Then I'd like a bowl too, sil-voo-play!\nNo ramen, no life, as they say!
Wow, someone's sounding cultured today...
I beg of you! I'd like an extra-large\nserving!
Hah! All right, fine.
I second that! Oh, and Joker's a big eater\ntoo!
Okay, okay. Extra-large for everyone. I'll\neven throw in some gyoza too.
Hell yeah!
All right, enough ramen talk! We still have\nanother Core to find, remember?
Panther's right. I'm worried about the rest\nof our friends, too.
Yeah. There's still no sign of Joker, Queen,\nor Closer...
Yes, indeed. Queen in particular. She's not\nused to the Metaverse yet.
You sure about that? I feel like Queen would\njust lay the beatdown on any baddies.
They sound like a dependable bunch. Well,\nwe should get goin', and fast.
I can smell the Core... It's coming from\noutside!
I concur. I sense it as well. Let's head in\nthat direction.
At the end of the day, you two seem to make\na pretty good duo, you know?
We absolutely do not!
Hey, see that thing behind the guard? I swear\nit looks just like the other Core.
You know, something about this feels super\nfamiliar to me...
Yes. A rather detestable memory... but it\nseems we may have been lured to another\nforgery.
Another one, you say? So were you fooled\nin a similar way by this Madarame fellow in\nhis Palace?
MREOW! No, I can't take it! The Phantom\nThieves deceived into stealing a fake twice?
Yeah, the award in that frame might actually\nbe a little different from ours...
True. It doesn't matter which is the real\none. We just have to take both.
That does simplify matters.
Despite how cool you two act, you really do\nlike brute-force solutions...
Of course, I'm not opposed to them either!
All right. In that case, let's make quick\nwork of this guy!
Hate... Hate...
Hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE!
I hate everything that dares disturb my\nheart!
Damn, it's tough... Nothing's working on it\nat all!
It seems we can't hurt it\nwhile its mouth is closed.\nWhat should we do...
We could try aiming for the nose? Then\nit'll have to open its mouth to breathe!
So we will simply force it to open its\nmouth... Yes, I think that could be worth a try.
Huh, what...? Why's it staring at us like\nthat!?
Seems it's chosen the target for its next\nattack... Keep your guard up!
In that case, what if we take out both eyes\nbefore it's able to attack?
Quite a brutal strategy.,. But not a bad\nidea. Let's aim for the eyes!
I can't see! Where... Where are theeeey!?
Nyahaha! Perfect! It went exactly as\nI predicted!
Hmph... Must've just gotten lucky. But\nI must commend your strategy, just this once.
What's got your feathers so ruffled?
Hey, don't you feel like the rest of it got\nstronger after we took down the eye?
Indeed. It seems that simply blinding it\nwon't be sufficient.
Whoa, wait, what're we supposed to do\nnow, then?
We may just have to wing it. Assess the\nsituation, find an opening, and make a\ndecisive strike!
This guy's seriously getting' on my nerves.\nBut we'll just have to take him down!
What? Of course... These ones will revive\nthemselves too!
...What do you mean, "of course"? You speak\nas if you already knew.
Ah. We did fight an enemy similar to this one\nbefore...
Why didn't you say so earlier? Don't you\nthink that might've been helpful?
Shut up! I don't think it's EXACTLY the same!
Geez, stop fighting and focus on the actual\nenemy! If it gets back up, just knock it down\nagain!
It seems that it takes some time for the\ndefeated parts to revive. If that's the\ncase...
Then we just need to take them all down\nbefore they can come back. Alright, let's\nfinish 'em off all at once!
Mrrraaahahaha! This time we got our hands\non a real Core!
That enemy just now, though... It was like\nMadarame but different. What was it?
I'm only just remembering this, but wasn't\nthe last guy defending a Core like Kamoshida?
Still, nothing's happening to this Palace.
I wouldn't say that... I sense a strange omen\nof change near the entrance.
I agree! And who knows, maybe that's where\nJoker and the others are!
I smell a Core this way...
Yes, and I sense a being with strong desires\nup ahead.
Strong desires? But I don't see anyone\naround here...
Hey! Over there! Is that...!
It indeed does look familiar.
Hold on, could that be...
Yeah. It looks just like Kaneshiro's Palace.\nThe one we were just infiltrating!
Kaneshiro? Who's that?
Err...
We can discuss that later. As I mentioned\na moment ago, I sense someone up ahead.
In other words, there is a strong possibility\nthat we can find our friends there, too.
Yes, precisely.
Gotcha. No wonder we couldn't find them\nhere. Turns out they were in an entirely\ndifferent Palace.
...If it even IS a Palace.
An uncharted territory lies beyond this\npoint. Wonder, could you take the reins?
Yeeeaaah!
This really is just like Kaneshiro's Palace.
You're right, even down to all the creepy\nparts. Doesn't it feel a little different,\nthough?
What the hell is that...? A walking ATM?
The ruler of this Palace sees everyday\npeople as mere tools to bring him money.
This place is the spitting image of\nKaneshiro's Palace. They even have the\nwalking cash machines...
Imitation or not, it feels so wrong. How\ncould anyone possibly think of using others\nto line their own pockets?
You said it. It was some money-grubbing\nmoron who put Pops and Masa-san in a\nbad spot.
I may not know this Kaneshiro guy, but I'm\ntakin' this personally.
Money, money, money. It's nice to have, but\nI bet you'd feel empty obsessing over it.
I suppose there is such a thing as excessive\ndesire.
For sure. Money's good to have, but only a\nscumbag goes around tricking others to\nget it.
Indeed. I cannot turn a blind eye to such an\nunderhanded scheme.
I ain't gonna sit around and take it either.\nIt's 'cause of assholes like him that\ninnocent people like Pops end up suffering.
That's why we gotta make sure that Kaneshiro\nputs his money where his mouth is!
Hm...? There appears to be someone near\nthe entrance.
I TOLD you!
We were only able to escape last time because\nwe found that Core thingy!
Even if what you say is true, isn't it too\ndangerous for us to go in alone?
We've both been separated from our allies.\nLet's take a moment to analyze the situation\nrather than running in blindly.
Urgh... I get your point, but is waiting\naround here really gonna get us anywhere?
I think heading in first and gathering intel\nwould be more efficient...
Wonder! Oh, and everyone else is here too!\nPhew, I'm glad you're all okay!
Huh? I don't think all of us here have met\nbefore...
You must be Closer. I've heard all about you.\nI'm Fox, it's a pleasure.
Queen! Good to see you're safe too!
You too, Closer! Good to see you're\ndoing well!
And Queen! Everything okay? We were\nworried since you're new to using Personas.
What do you mean, "odd little guy"!?
Wait, we didn't introduce ourselves yet.\nHow'd you figure that out?
She sure interrogated the hell out of me!\nQueen was convinced I was a bad guy when\nwe first bumped into each other.
It's okay, we can put that all behind us now.
She's right about that. I may have found\nmyself in a similar predicament if it wasn't\nfor Panther.
It seems that leaving this place causes one\nto lose their memories of all that occurred.
Really? Again!? Stop stealing my lines out\nfrom under me!
I'm a Phantom Thief. Stealing is my patented\nmove, no?
So that's why we couldn't tell you even if we\nwanted. We'll probably forget this too...
Whoa, you already figured all that out?
Hmm, good point.
There's a lot we don't know, sure, but we\ndo know that finding the Core will send\nus back!
Hey, hold on a sec... Is it me, or am I\ngetting grilled for answers!?
The desperation is clear in her voice.
I'm envious of you...
Your intellect and insight are truly\nremarkable.
I've been searching for an advisor. What say\nyou to joining our Phantom Thieves?
Heeey! Watch what you're saying!
Listen, I don't know about trying to poach\nsomeone right in front of her friends.
Hmph... Fine then. I will ask no more.
Well, if you do ever grow tired of them, I'd\nbe more than happy to welcome you.
What happened to not asking anymore?
Stop it, Cattle. Sorry about the little guy.\nHe doesn't know when to shut his beak\nsometimes.
"Little guy"!?
Anyway, why don't we head inside? We still\nneed to find Joker.
I agree! I'm getting fidgety just standing\naround here.
Unsurprisingly, even the interior resembles\nKaneshiro's Palace.
It was right around here, wasn't it?
Hm? What was?
You shoulda seen Queen. She awakened her\nPersona and was suddenly on a motorcycle.
A motorcycle...!?
She was like, "Screw you and your new\nmoney!" and blew the baddies away!
What a valiant sight it was. I regret not\ncapturing the moment with a painting.
I know! Do you think you could do it once\nmore? Right here.
You say that, but you did seem to be\nenjoying yourself.
Yeah... Fist of the Phantom Star...
M-My bad...!
Heh. You seem reliable, Queen. You come\nacross as a strong female leader!
No kidding. You put the boys in line whenever\nthey say something stupid.
Now then. Would you tell us about this\nPalace? We're entirely unfamiliar with it.
Well, unlike Madarame's Palace, we haven't\nseen much of Kaneshiro's...
Oh, right. I guess you won't know everything\nabout it then.
Well, we haven't even pinned down where\nKaneshiro's Treasure is.
What's more, Joker isn't here either.
He must be off on his own looking around.\nThis is Joker we're talking about.
All by himself? Sounds like a reason to\nworry.
Eeeh, I don't know if we really need to.
Oh, sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.\nI mean he should be fine on his own.
Joker is swifter and more careful than us\nall. I doubt any enemies will find him.
True. The way he fought last time was just\nincredible.
Indeed. So we can look for the Core on our\nown without having to worry about him.
That's the deal!
Given your confidence, we can make finding\nthe Core our primary objective. Now, where\nis it...
I sense something in the basement. I only\nsmell one this time around too.
Hmph! I was going to say that...!
Heh heh, I got you good. Smooth like a\nPhantom Thief!
Look at all these wads of cash... I wonder\nhow much all of this adds up to.
I'm sure it's all fake, but imagine how much\nstuff you could buy if it wasn't.
Hey, what would you guys spend it on?
Painting equipment for me. Not just\ncanvases, but new palettes and painting\nknives, too.
I don't know much about art supplies. Are\nthey pretty expensive?
It depends, but high-end tools come in\nthe six-figure range.
Six figures...!?
They say a true artist can paint with any\nbrush, but quality supplies are always nice.
A number of my fine-tipped brushes have\nseen better days... I'd replace those first.
All that cash and the first thing you think\nof is brushes? Man, you sure are an\nart freak.
I can't use money in the real world, so I'd\ngive it to you as a gift, Panther!
Seriously? Wow! Thanks, Mona!
Given that the fake feline does not benefit\nfrom wealth, it appears he would rather\ndirect it toward his... other ambitions.
What's that supposed to mean!? Okay, then\nwhat would you spend it on?
Why, steaks, of course. Thick-cut and\ncooked rare... *shlurp*
I've never actually heard anyone make\nthat kind of sound with their mouth before.
Steak, you say? Then I hope you'd invite\nme along!
Do you really have to jump in every time\nfood comes up?
Me? Well... I'd open my own store.
Oh! So a ramen joint, right?
Yeah. Who knows how many years it'll be\nuntil I can really make it happen, though.
Hey, I bet it'll totally be worth the wait!\nHit me up when you open shop and I'll\nstop by!
I will. Thanks.
Heh heh... And I'll be tagging along,\nof course!
Did you not hear what I just... Oh, whatever.
Hey, do you think this much money'd be\nenough to build a ballpark?
I've always wanted somewhere to play\nbaseball near my house!
Huuuh? No way! But there's heaps of it!
Oh, right... I didn't know you had to pay for\nthat. Urgh, curse you expensive land...!
Hahaha! What's a plot of land ever done to\ndeserve your rage?
Honestly, I wouldn't know what to do with\nall this money.
Yeah. I don't even know how to go about\nbuying fancy stuff in the first place.
It's actually kind of fun seeing how far you\ncan stretch a little change.
I bet buying snacks wouldn't be fun at all\nif you had stacks of cash like this.
You wouldn't even need to choose. Just walk\nin and buy up all their stock.
Though with this much money, I could say\nfarewell to bean sprout bowls...
Bean sprouts...? As in bean sprouts over\nplain rice?
Oh, no. There's no rice.
So just plain bean sprouts, then?
What about you, Wonder? What would you do\nwith all of this cash?
Ah... What strong desire. Of course, it is\nsaid that the riches can lead one to\ndistortion.
Remember, moderation is important, Wonder.
I guess that seems like something you\nwould say.
Uhh, I asked what you would want to do\nwith it...
Also, what's with that look?
If you see this much money in real life,\ndon't just take it. You'd be a plain old\nrobber, not a Phantom Thief.
Intruders! Intruders!
Multiple intruders spotted! To the security\nroom, at once!
Whoa, this is bad!
Oh no! Look at the monitor!
Intruders! Prepare to be eliminated!
There's no end to them! How are there this\nmany?
We triggered the security system. They'll\nkeep on coming forever at this rate!
Ugh! Isn't there something we can do? I don't\nknow how long we can keep this up!
Intruder spotted! Intruder spotted!
There's more!?
Huh...? Joker!?
Stop the intruder! Don't allow him to pass\nthrough!
Defend the basement at all costs! Do not\nlet him in!
We'll just have to eliminate you right here!
So that's Joker? Even on that old monitor,\nyou can see he's got some serious moves!
Could he be drawing their attention to help\nus out?
In that case, we gotta make quick work of\nthese guys and track him down!
All right! Let's crush these guys and meet up\nwith Joker!
Unbelievable... Did he figure out the\nlocation of the Core all by himself?
Who can say. He does have sharp instincts,\nso it doesn't surprise me.
Anyway, let's hurry over to him right now!
What a place...
It appears to be a giant safe. A typical\ncognition for a man obsessed with money.
Ah, Joker! You're okay!
Hey, we were so worried about you!
Eh, I figured you'd be safe. But you did make\nme sweat a little.
Indeed. It's good to see that you're well.
Nice to finally meet you. Allow me to\nintroduce myself, I'm Soy...
Maybe Joker's gonna learn how to make\nramen next.
So it won't be long until they'll be serving\nramen at Leblanc, hmm? Heh heh.
But what of my ramen?
Since when did this become "your" ramen?
All right. I sense the Core is close. It's\nsurely just beyond this door.
Which means there's probably an enemy\nguarding it.
Oh, right. I guess there was a big fight\nlast time, too.
In that case, let's pump ourselves up!
Me!?
Uh, wh-what do you want me to do?
I'm still not used to using my Persona,\nso I might hold everyone back. But still...
I intend on doing everything I can.\nI'm countin' on you guys!
Very well, leave it to me.
I believe that something like fate has\nbrought us all together today.
Let us treasure this bond and join together\nto overcome this challenge.
We will defeat the ruler of this Palace and\nget our hands on that Core!
Whoa, now that's a speech!
She's in student council president mode...
Then let's go. This false Palace's Core is\nours!
That looks like the kinda guy that'd be\nguarding the Core.
He feels extra creepy... like, that's no\nnormal Shadow.
Stay sharp, everyone! Let's go!
I feel it... the anger coursing through\nme...!
The sky... the earth... I hate all that\nI see! I despise it all...!
I want to destroy everything... just as\nI desire!
Why...? Why do you stand in my way!?
Hate... Hate... Hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE!
I will bury anyone that stands in my way...!\nThis time, I will unite the powers into one!
MEEEAAAH!
I got the Core!
Just as I thought. This place is collapsing!\nHurry, it's time to escape!
Phew... We finally made it out of there!\nGreat job, everyone.
All that's left is to leave now... right?
Oh! Wait, Closer! I know we didn't have\nmuch time to talk, but...
I was able to get revenge for my best friend\nin the end.
Really? Oh, that's wonderful to hear!
I think I was able to do the same. And it\nmight be thanks to the courage you gave me.
I'm so happy to hear that! You know, I have\nyou to thank, too.
I woulda been in real deep trouble without\nyou around today, Soy. Thanks!
I should be the one thankin' you, Skull.\nAll of you, really... I appreciate it.
Please, there is no need. We couldn't have\ndone it without all of you.
More importantly, I'd like an extra-large\nramen and rice... and three plates of gyoza\nwhen we get back.
That's way more than what you asked for\nbefore. Besides, we're gonna forget\neverything when we leave.
Haha! Still, though. Now that there's this\nconnection between us... I'm sure we'll\nmeet again.
You're right about that. These bonds are\neternal.
I imagine it should be possible. Regarding\nthat advisor position, Queen...
You still haven't given up on that!? We're\nnot gonna have any recollection of what\nhappened here once we leave!
Nothing in life is certain, you know.
No way! Not on my watch! Queen's OUR\nprecious ally!
Indeed... You're right. Until we meet again,\nQueen.
You'd better not try to steal her next time\nwe meet either!
All right, all right. I'm not that much of\na boor. She makes an exceptional ally. I hope\nyou cherish her.
Yeah. All of my friends were okay, and we\nhave you to thank for that.
Hope we meet again.
Uh, were we heading to Mementos today?
Hey, what's the matter? You seem to be\nstaring into space.
Are you feeling unwell?
Hmm... I see. Then perhaps we ought to take\nthe day off.
True. No reason to push yourself too hard!
I won't let you have my money! No one\ncan have it... No one!
He summoned a guard... Looks like he's\nserious about protecting that money.
You might be onto something. If only we\ncould find a way to steal it...
What's up with this guy? He's super tough!
Hoom... Perhaps it has something to do with\nthe guards he summoned.
That does seem likely. Let's try taking\nout the guards!
Huh? Did it drop something? Wait, is that\nthe money he was talking about?
Whoa, for real!? If we take out more,\nwe'll be rich!
Settle down, Skull. That's not real money.
Of course. Figures it'd be something\nlike that!
However, I can sense some sort of power\nfrom that imitation money... It might be\nadvantageous to collect them.
Okay! Then let's keep taking down the guards!
Aghhh! Money... I need more money!
I know it ain't real cash, but I feel kinda\nbad for him.
Ah... That cry of anguish, welling up from\ndeep within the soul! You can feel the pain\nso vividly!
Wh-What is that? A giant pink...pig?
That shape... It could only be a large\npiggy bank. How fascinating...
No way, it's gigantic! How are we supposed\nto beat something like this!?
Don't worry, that "money" beefs us up too.\nWe can't lose!
This just means we made it to the\nmain course!
Hoom. Your unanimous bravery in the face\nof such peril is heartening.
Alright, let's do this! Don't get too scared,\nSkull!
Who're you callin' scared? Let's just beat\nthe hell out of this guy!
I sense it too. A potent attack is imminent.\nEveryone, stand your ground!
Huh? More fake money?
Hmm... It likely gives us the counterfeit\nbills only to collect them again.
What's this got to do with a laundromat?\nI don't really get this, but it sounds\nlike a pain.
If we all have the counterfeit bills, most\nof them will be taken back. In short...
You catch on quick. We can use skills on\nour allies to transfer the cash.
Stay back! If you come any closer, I'll throw myself into the sea!
Wonder
Caf\xe9 Leblanc? Hm... By the looks of it,\nthis establishment is closed.
This sensation... Are you...
No, it's more like... Have we met somewhere?
You can hear my voice then!
That must mean you perceived me\nspeaking in the Metaverse...
I feel like I should remember that, but...\nI don't. What about you?
Hmm. Well, no need to sweat the details.\nYou don't seem dangerous, anyway!
It's only a vague recollection, but...\nyou're also a Persona-user, correct?
I didn't think there were Persona-users\nout there besides our group.\nThat's quite the surprise.
It's a vast world out there! It's not\nthat odd for there to be more\nPersona-users who we don't know.
That we are! But I think we should all\nkeep the details of our operations\nto ourselves.
Phantom Thieves must operate in secret.\nI take it you're in the same line of work?
Then it's best we both avoid sharing info\nthat could blow our covers.
Let's make an agreement for neither side\nto investigate the other's activities.
We're all leading a double life here.\nThis way we can at least relax\nwith each other.
Make yourself at home.\nIf you'd like coffee or curry,\nyou can have some here anytime.
I'd say... I'm more of a freeloader\nwho's looking after this place\nwhile the manager's out.
Glad to hear it.
Mewhehehe... You can't beat\nthe coffee or curry at Leblanc!
Ah\u2014 Before I forget...
Occasionally my friends come by the shop.\nI hope you can meet them sometime.
They're all... good people.
See you again sometime!
...ey!
Hey! Are you even listening to me?
My goodness... You just stopped there,\nstaring into space. Are you quite all right?\nAs I was saying, this place is closed!
But the aroma of coffee still lingers here.\nThe beans must have been high-quality.
Yo, I heard about you from Ren!
We can't talk about any of the big stuff,\nbut we can hang out! Right, {NAME2}?
I grew up abroad, but don't worry,\nmy Japanese is just fine!\nWe can chat as much as you like!
It'd be a shame to waste the chance,\nafter all!
You belong to a different group of\nPhantom Thieves? I won't ask for details,\nbut I do have one request...
Good to see you, {NAME2}.
Ren's grinding some beans right now.\nWant to join me for a cup or two?
Hm... The middle letter is C... Balaclava?\nNo, that won't work...
Oh, {NAME2}, I was just doing a crossword puzzle. Care to join me?
Oh, {NAME2}, perfect timing.\nDo you want to play?
Hello. Oh, yes... If you hear loud noises\nfrom upstairs today, don't worry about it.
Yusuke is borrowing Ren's room to work on\na painting for school. Apparently, he was\ntaken by inspiration...
Please model for one of my sketches.\nHmph... why the suspicious look?
We have a lot of oddballs, but I hope we can get along. They're all excited to get to know you more.
Oh... Me? Right, yes... I've also been looking forward to the chance to speak with you.
Um... Unlike everyone else,\nI'm not very good at talking...
Good work today.\nWhich coffee would you like this time?
I just happened to have some beans that Haru brought over.\nShould I brew these ones?
I'd really love to talk to {NAME2}, so...\nI-I'm counting on you!
How do you do? You're {NAME2}, correct?\nMy name is Haru Okumura. Nice to meet you!
I think it's wonderful to get the chance to\ntalk to someone from another group of Phantom\nThieves.
I understand we can't talk about details,\nbut I hope we can have a fun time together.
Welcome! Take whatever seat you like.
We got some new beans in today.\nFeel free to have a coffee to\ntry them if you'd like.
You're looking tired today, {NAME2}...
Want me to get you something sweet to eat?\nOr put some extra sugar in your coffee?
Mewehehehee... Treasure... Discovered...\nMewhehe...
Huh...!? I didn't say anything weird just\nnow, did I? Right!?
You can read the books over there\nif you want. Feel free to take it easy\nwhile you're here.
A recommendation? Hm... The second from the\nleft there? I don't know why, but I always\nfeel a bit bolder after reading it.
Have you met everyone in our group,\n{NAME2}? I feel like there's\na connection between us Persona-users.
Maybe someday a group of Persona-users\nneither of us knows will show up here...\nWho knows.
Oh, {NAME2}!\nYou came again today!
Mewehehe, it's pretty cozy here, isn't it?\nI've got my own reserved seat here,\nso I get it!
The manager of this caf\xe9, the chief,\nhe's an extremely gracious gentleman,\nisn't he?
He always provides me with the finest milk,\nafter all!
Hey. {NAME2}, have you been eating enough?
Yusuke was so hungry earlier that he\ncollapsed. Make sure you're getting enough\nfood in you before you end up like him.
I do sometimes think I'd like to try\nRen's coffee, but...
Oh, {NAME2}! Could you blow on it\na bit for me? This tongue of mine\nis pretty sensitive.
{NAME2}! Are you here for curry today?
I'd say they've just finished cooking,\nso you should get it while it's\nhot and fresh!
Hey, {NAME2}, you want some soda?
Nobody else around here drinks it!\nYou've gotta join me! C'mon, please!
Argh... I'm gonna drown in homework...
There's math, English, and... damn,\nsomething else too... I wonder if\nI can ask for an extension...
Hey there, {NAME2}! Oh, did I sound too\nexcited there? Hmm...
Maybe it's because I was talking with Makoto\nabout going shopping sometime. I just can't\nwait!
So, {NAME2}... There's actually this\nramen shop I REALLY recommend!
Ugh, just the thought of those noodles\nsoaking in that rich broth is\nmaking my stomach growl!
Yo, {NAME2}! Sorry, we started eating the\ncurry without ya!
I really worked up an appetite in gym class\ntoday... But you make sure to dig in too!
How's it going? Are you also here for\nsome coffee, {NAME2}?
Ren's coffee's the best! It's the perfect\ndrink to sip as you chill!
Hey, {NAME2}, are you good at school?
I'm, uh... Well... Actually, I'm sorry\nI brought this up, forget I said anything...
Hmm... a motif for the painting... I feel\nsomething coming to me but...
Perhaps a cup of Ren's bitter coffee will\nhelp me find inspiration.
You have girls in your Phantom Thief\ngroup too, right, {NAME2}?
I'd love to meet them! We're all\nPersona-users and high schoolers.\nHow can we not get along!?
Get this! So I'm on a major diet\nright now, right? Like, capital D diet.
But then Ren subjected me to the smell of\ntoday's curry! So now it's like what other\nchoice do I have... None, right!?
Ah, {NAME2}. Have you come for\nsome curry? What a coincidence; so have I.
I just lost three days of food money on\nart supplies, so this curry will have to\nlast me for that time.
I go to a different school from Ren and\nthe rest, but I sometimes study here\nwith them.
You should come join us some time.\nYou could witness Ryuji's devastating\nstudy techniques.
Agh...\nPhew. Staying in the same position for so long\nmakes my shoulders go stiff...
Don't forget to stretch too, {NAME2}.
Hello there. You look tired today...
I recommend you have some of Ren's coffee.\nIt removes fatigue with truly\nunnatural efficacy.
{NAME2}, good to see\u2014wait!\nDon't move... Just look this way\nand hold that pose!
I've been struck by inspiration...!\nPlease, let me draw you in this\nexact position!
Excellent work, {NAME2}!
I'm digging in to the curry first!
Hm? You're interested in my PC?\nMweheh, this is my masterpiece right here!
If you ever want to build a PC, feel free\nto ask me for advice anytime!
I'm starting to want to squish Mona's paws.\nMona? Monaaa? Is he not here?
Knowing he's not here makes me want to do it\neven more!
Ryuji tried to down a whole bottle of soda in\none go earlier. He's actually really good at it...
There's no way I could do it. What about you, {NAME2}?\nIf you wanna try, I won't stop you!
What's your version of Oracle like? I'm the only\none in our group with my kind of Persona, so...
I can't help but wonder about what they'd be like!\nBut I guess it'd be best not to ask too much...
It's strange, isn't it? Now it feels like\ncoffee pairs with curry, and curry with coffee.
Have you every felt that way too? Hehe.
Yusuke just burst in and collapsed from hunger...\nSaid he ran out of money for art supplies again.
It's nice to see he's passionate about drawing, but\nI worry about him sometimes...\nShould I bring him something, too?
Nice timing. The curry's ready.
A message from Ren: "Have as much as you\nwant." I might have a second helping too.
About that part-time job you and Ren have\nafter school... I must admit, I'm a little curious...
I've been wondering what job might suit me,\nbut I haven't followed up on it...
Ah, I can't believe I've been here so long already.\nI always lose track of time when I'm here...
Just goes to show how cozy this place is, right?\nDo you feel the same way, {NAME2}?
{NAME2}, how do you take your coffee?
Black, milk, sugar?
Got it, I'll make sure to have some\non hand next time I make you coffee.
You're the type who likes to taste the flavor\nof the beans alone then? Me too.
Oh, let me know if you don't actually\nlike coffee, though. I can get you\nsomething else.
Oh, you cook at your place too, {NAME2}?\nA big kitchen must be nice!
I just use this kitchen here...\nOnly to make curry, though, to be honest.
I guess I could manage that.\nOkay, new recipe next time!\nWill you taste-test for me?
It's about time I reorganize this\nfridge anyway... We got too much stuff from\nthat big sale at the supermarket.
With all of this we could even make\nsomething besides curry. I'm sure Ryuji\nwill be happy.
Didn't Morgana say something to you earlier?
He asked for sushi? Sorry about that,\nI'll talk to him...
How much more can he want...? I feel like\nI just got some the other day.
Oh, {NAME2}, just say the word and\nI'll save you a plate too. So long as you\ndon't mind a barebones meal...
With that hint... No, that's not right...\nThat wouldn't fit with the\nhorizonal answer...
This crossword's trickier than usual...\nFree or not, it bugs me if I can't\nsolve these!
Any ideas, {NAME2}? I need a\nvertical five-letter word over here...
So, {NAME2}, have you ever\nhad really high-end sushi?
Like fatty tuna, or sea urchin,\nor fatty tuna, or medium tuna,\nor kuruma shrimp, or fatty tuna!
Really, you have!? Are all high school\nstudents rich these days?
Mewhehehe... I see, I see.\nEating high-end sushi should be\nreserved for special occasions anyway!
What!? How perceptive of you...\nNot too shabby!
This is making me crave sushi...\nI wonder if Lady Ann would share\nsome with me? Probably not...
Why are you staring at me like that?\nDon't tell me you're thinking of\npetting me...
Hmm... Well, I guess I can let you give me\na few strokes. But! Don't touch my tail!
You're... a much more skilled petter\nthan I expected. It's so nice, I could\ndoze... off... Mewhehe...
But to think there were other\nPhantom Thief groups out there...\nIt really is a small world!
Is it possible there are also other groups\naside from us Phantom Thieves that\nalso use Personas?
So, {NAME2}, have you ever\nhad a cr\xeape before?
Ren stops in front of the cr\xeape shop\nsometimes... Do high school boys really like\nto eat that stuff?
...Is that so? Well... if you offered me a bite,\nI might not stop you.
If there are, I'd love to meet them and\nlearn more! At least if they're as\nfriendly as you.
Oh, right. You should give that book\nright there a read some time.
It's a new one our chief brought in recently.\nIt's about home vegetable gardens, I think.
You raise plants too, right?\nIt might come in handy!
I've been doing tons of working out and stuff\nsince becoming a Phantom Thief!
How 'bout you, {NAME2}?\nYou got any special training regime?
Oh, nice! Yeah, you gotta use\nthe right equipment if you want results!
{NAME2}, do you get enough rest?
Oh, I guess I don't need to be worried about you then. Still... take care of yourself.
I understand trying to power through, but you can't overwork yourself. Don't forget before it's too late that you can also rely on your friends.
I think we'd all hope this place is at least\nsomewhere you feel you can rest.
Curry with coffee... I still think\nthe combination is odd, but\nI've gotten used to it.
Whenever I eat curry these days, it doesn't feel quite right if I don't have coffee as well.
Ah! {NAME2}! Sorry 'bout this!
I feel like I'm gonna burp up for days.\nI tried drinking a whole soda in one go earlier...
...! Oh no here it co\u2014Ah! Aaagh!
I suppose that speaks to just how good Leblanc's coffee and curry are. Hehe, great minds think alike and all.
We just received the results from our\nmock exams... Only I have discovered I made\nsome careless mistakes. How regrettable.
Despite my best efforts to give everything\nanother once over before handing it in...\nI'll need to try harder going forward.
Maybe I should try studying here next time.\nWould you care to join me, {NAME1}-kun?
Today's coffee was a bit acidic, but\nonce I started drinking it, I couldn't stop.
I just kept getting refills... Ren's really getting good at brewing coffee!
Perhaps he is more committed to it than I thought. Of course, all the better I'm sure if he's developing a talent.
The batting cages!? Huh...\nActually, batting's probably not too bad\nan upper body workout!
Good stuff! I'd better add another hundred\npush-ups to my set to keep up with you, man!
It was crazy in the last Palace we\nwent to, man! Or wait, am I not s'posed\nto tell you that?
Damn, we finally meet another Persona-user\nand we still hafta hide stuff? What a pain...
Right!? Maybe if we all run into you\nin the Metaverse someday, yeah?
I'm in deep shit if I fail this next test...\nEven Ann said so...
I'm doing the best I can, okay!?\nI just can't remember crap like\nnumbers and dates...
I just saw some person wearing a weird mask!\nIt almost made me scream...
... when I looked more closely, I realized it was\nFutaba. If you see her too, don't be surprised...
Why were you wearing that if you were only with\npeople you knew? Just one of those days?
You know any good memorizing tricks?\nLike that "PEMDAS" thing or somethin'?
I feel like Ren really goes nuts with\nhis cooking and coffee stuff for you here.
I guess having someone new around\nmakes it feel special or somethin'?
So go on and dig in, {NAME2}!\nWe're growing boys, y'know!
I was just out for cr\xeapes, and\nthey had a new seasonal special!
When I see the words "limited time only,"\nI feel like have to try it! What about you?
Right? When you know this might be\nyour only chance to try it, you gotta get it!
True... Specials do have some weird\nflavor combinations sometimes. But you\ncan't go wrong with the classics!
Ahh, this conversation is making me\nwant cr\xeapes! I'm totally getting one\nafter this!
Hey, {NAME2}, do you have\na part-time job or anything?
I was thinking getting a more active job\nmight be good exercise, but...
Oh, so like, exercising by moving heavy stuff\naround? Good idea! I'll check if\nany are hiring!
Can I say, {NAME2}...\nI'm kind of curious what sort of outfits\nyour Phantom Thief group wears.
Ryuji and I have totally different styles,\nso maybe you guys are like that too?
I hear a lot of stories from Haru\nabout vegetables they harvested.
Even though they're the same plant, the way they\ngrow is so different. I'd love to sketch them!
... Of course, I'm also interested in the taste of the vegetables themselves.
Ahh, I wanna see! I'll just have to hope\nwe run into you all in the Metaverse someday!
Mmmmm! Oh, {NAME2}!\nDid you come for some curry?
Be careful then! Ren put a lot more spice\nin today's curry than usual!
Not that it isn't still delicious!\nSpicy can be good! But my mouth\nis on fire now...
Yesterday, I finally managed to complete\na painting I've been working on\nfor quite a while.
The process was quite involved with\na lot of trial and error, but I think it\nturned out well, if I do say so myself.
Hmhm, have I piqued your interest?\nSuch praise is the greatest blessing\nan artist can have.
It's... difficult to describe in words.\nI'd prefer to let it speak for itself.
All right, I'll bring it here sometime.\nThen you can look and tell me\nyour impressions.
Ann recently introduced me to a song\nthat is supposed to be popular right now.
Unfortunately, my experience with music\nis rather rudimentary. I can't even tell\nif the song is good or not.
It's very up-tempo. She said the music video\nfeatures a "totally lit dance challenge,"\nwhatever that means...
Ah... So... hungry...
{NAME2}, do you happen to have\nanything to eat on you?
Futaba's PC was making a really loud noise...\nI thought that maybe it was broken or something.
She said it can withstand the proccessing though,\nso I guess it'll be okay.
I'm a little worried, but if Futaba said so,\nit's prboably fine, right?
Or if you could make something,\nthat would be good. For free at the moment.\nBut I'll repay you... someday!
The other day, I discovered a rare spice.\nI gave it to Ren for today's curry...
But the heat of it was shocking!\nIt was more than spicy\u2014it was\nsomehow revitalizing!
However, I can't remember what that spice\nwas called. Perhaps it was meant to simply\nbe a once-in-a-lifetime encounter...
Don't you think having just a coffee seems\na bit weird?
The angel and devil inside me are fighting\nabout if I should be more productive in my\nfree time...!
Hmm, I could learn from you and Ren...\nI wonder if I can cut the curry ingredients?
Cleaning... I'm not very good at it... Maybe\nI could mop the hallway at least...?
Mweheheh, thanks for your input! I'll talk\nabout it with Ren later!
Actually, I sometimes have a part-time job\nhere, serving coffee and curry!
... I'm still not good at customer service\nthough, so I have to wear a mask\nall the time.
Heh heh heh... This mask is surprisingly\nhandy! It hides your face, but your vision\nis great!
Lots of people seem to like this crossword\npuzzle, so I got curious and decided to give\nit a try.
There's some surprisingly tough ones in here.\nWell, they'll be easy for me, of course.
Wanna give it a go? I can give you some hints\nif you need, hehehe!
Gaaah! Will you hear me out, {NAME2}?
Inari messed with all the figures in my room\nagain and now they're in all sorts of\nstrange poses!
I hate that artsy feel they all have now!\nWhat should I do? Should I just leave it?
Secret ingredient... secret ingredient...\nAh, {NAME2}! What secret ingredient should\nI add to the curry?
When I looked it up, some of the more common\nones included chocolate, honey, and\ngrated apple...
I'm overwhelemed by all the options. If you\nhave any ideas, I'd love to hear them!
Since I grow vegetables as a hobby, my school\nlets me use a space on the roof for planting...
I'm not sure what I should plant next,\nthough. Do you have any\nrecommendations, {NAME2}?
That could work! Once they're ready, we could\nroast them together, too... Hehe, that sounds fun.
Zucchini... could that grow at school?\nIt might be tough, but it's worth a try!
Melons! You're not wrong, some melons are\nhandled like vegetables. I never thought\nof that before!
Thanks for the input. I'll go look at the\nseeds I have available and decide.
Good day. Did you come to drink coffee today?\nIf so, I have some recommended beans for you...
If you're up for a taste test, I'd like you\nto try them too, {NAME2}. What do\nyou think?
If you ask Ren, I'm sure he'll make it\nfor you, so please enjoy your order...\nor something along those lines.
All the books on the counter look like\nthey're worth reading.
But who's lining them up? Today, there's even\na continuation of a series I read recently...
I really enjoyed reading it, so I wanted to\nthank them. I'll have to ask Ren about it later.
...Ah, this? This is Ryuji's assignment.\nAh, I'm not doing it for him, though.
He finished already, but he asked me to check\nhis answers. I'm just marking them off.
The results were... well... there's\ndefinitely some room for improvement...
Mako-chan and I are third-years, so that\nmakes us everyone's senpai...
But no one treats us differently, so it's\nalways nice to spend time with everyone.
Are any of your friends older, {NAME2}? You\nmay find that you can be more frank with them\nafter all.
{NAME2}! It's you.
The Metaverse Navigator's\nscreen is all staticky...
I told them my code name...
Lufel's being pretty loud\nhimself, but I guess\nI should stay silent...
We all introduced ourselves\nand got up to speed...
The volleyball court is full\nof young women being put\nthrough a grueling punishment.
Everyone is clearly exhausted.\nI guess it's up to me to get\nus out of this...
What's going on...
Sounds like Joker and Mona\nboth stay at Caf\xe9 Leblanc...
Maybe I should pay a visit\nif I ever have a chance to go\nto Yongen-Jaya...
Anyway, looking for this Core\nis our priority right now...
I feel like I've already gone\nsomewhere today... I just\ncan't remember where.
There's something in\nmy pocket...
That's a lot of enemies...\nLooks like I'll have to\nface them alone!
Somehow, yes.
Oh, right... I'm Queen. Nice to meet you.
But is this really the time for casual\nintroductions? This all does feel quite\nsurreal.
More or less. I was with Closer this whole\ntime, and somehow, we managed to avoid\nenemy contact.
Um... So you're Wonder, that's Soy, and this\nodd little guy is Cattle?
Closer told me all about you.
I'm... sorry about that.
Suddenly finding myself in a strange place\nput me on high alert, and the next thing I\nknew, there was a stranger here...
Judging by what Closer told me, this isn't\nthe first time something like this has\nhappened.
If that's true, then why didn't anyone bring\nthis to my attention before?
I suppose that means we won't even be\nable to process what happened once we're\nback, either.
Like, why were we sent here and why some\nof us were separated.
Or how this place is similar yet so different\nfrom a Palace we already know...
Not to mention the Core and everything\nelse... Is it really just a Meta-Nav error?
That may have worked before, but who knows\nwhether it'll work this time?
There are just too many uncertainties to\ndraw any conclusions.
Oh, I didn't mean to sound like I was\ncriticizing you.
S-Sorry. That offer is quite hard to accept.
Hehe, I am flattered though.
You're right. And it should be safer with\nthis many people... Let's go.
It really does...
Oh, er, I got a little carried away there,\nthat's all...
What? No way!
Just seeing Kaneshiro's gluttonous face\ncaused me to snap.
It was something that happened in the heat\nof the moment. I couldn't pull it off again\neven if I wanted.
Don't call me that!
Let's move on already! We need to look\naround this place.
In that case, I think we should head to the\nbasement first. Joker might even be there.
Sorry to shatter your dreams, but... I highly\ndoubt it.
You live in Tokyo, don't you? I doubt this\nwould even cover the cost of the land.
Okay, I think that's enough discussing\nhypothetical situations.
We should hurry up and search elsewhere.\nThere is the issue of Joker too.
Are all those Shadows heading here? We're\nin trouble!
No, wait! Look over there!
So he's okay. Where do you think he's\nheading, though?
Their numbers have thinned out. I think we\ncan handle them now.
I imagine so. Still, even Joker is in danger\nacting as bait all on his own.
Just as I thought. Joker's heading to the\nbasement.
You're right. Let's get going.
Now... where is Joker?
I really do feel more at ease with you\naround. Now, this means we've managed to\nfully regroup.
Those two are really getting into it. But...\nit seems like they're talking about food.
I don't know about that. You lose your\nmemory of this place once you leave,\nremember?
Me...? Well, okay then.
Ahem. We've managed to come this far\nthanks to our united efforts.
Each and every single one of us played their\npart, the other Phantom Thieves included.
While our escape is not assured... we must\nstill work together and get that Core!
Everyone seems pumped up...
Phew. Well, we got this Core thanks to all\nof you. I just hope we can return now.
Okay, you two. That's enough. This whole\nworld could collapse at any moment, so\nthere really isn't time to waste.
Looks like this is where\nwe must part ways...
I feel like I've heard this\nconversation somewhere\nbefore...
Not to mention it feels like\nI'm already done for\nthe day...
Seems like it. Maybe the money is actually\ngiving him power?
You're right, unfortunately. This is the\nMetaverse, so these must be products\nof cognition.
Huh? Do you feel sorry for him or something?\nAnyways, let's press the attack!
Yes. Together, we are invincible.
This aura... I have a bad feeling!
Why is he scattering it around like that?\nWhat's going on?
I see... It's like money laundering.
We should keep it all in one place instead.
The rich aroma of coffee\ndrifts from the entrance.\nSeems like a relaxing caf\xe9...
I should come back\nanother time.
I can't really recall why...\nBut I feel like I somehow\nknow this place...
I'm... inside the caf\xe9?\nFor some reason... it feels\na bit like the Metaverse.
Yet safe at the same time...
They don't seem dangerous.\nPlus, I have this odd feeling\nthat we've met before...
Lufel's right,\nthe caf\xe9 is closed...
And yet...\nI can still taste that coffee\nand curry in my mouth...
It seems I can only go in\nat certain times...
Hoom, it's over...
Well, let's be on our way.
Hoom, so that girl used her quick wits and\npersuasiveness to get her way...
Her skills of negotiation are truly something\nto aspire to.
Astounding... The gorilla stopped rampaging\nto rescue that woman!
The way it climbed up Skytree with her\nin one hand was simply remarkable...
I guess that inside the\ngigantic body of the gorilla,\nthere was a gentle heart...
I see... All their training in the lush\nforest was to acquire the skills for that\nclimactic final.
I guess their martial art techniques really\ngave them the upper hand... Or would that be\nthe upper foot in soccer?
The swiftness of the\nmonks' movements\nwas a sight to behold.
Although he rose to stardom through unusual\ncircumstances, his desire was just as strong\nas when he was an office worker...
Watching Shiro's performance\ntaught me how to woo people\nwith charm...
Good heavens! Did you see all the chili in\nthat ramen!? The soup was bright red...!
Just looking at it made me break out\nin a sweat...
I couldn't help but cheer for\nSpicy-Man as he boldly\nslurped up those noodles.
So in the end, all was well... The boss who\nrefused to treat his employees like human\nbeings was brought to justice.
It would have taken great courage to confront\ntheir boss... and even more to break into\nsong in the middle of the street!
I respected the bravery of\nthe employees who stood up\nfor their rights...
So the kid thought he could outsmart\nhis teacher, and wound up trapped\nin mind detention...
It goes to show that not everybody is\ncut out to be a Phantom Thief...
Blu's upbringing was not too dissimilar to\nthose poor children's...
Right and wrong... We consider them\nopposites, but in truth, they're merely\ntwo sides of the same coin.
Not even the strongest of bonds can\nclear away the sins of the past...\nA harsh message, indeed.
And yet, it was that same bond that led the\npoliceman to rescue the crime boss... One\ncan only imagine how conflicted he felt.
To think that young monkey could master\nkung fu in such a short span of time...!
...Say, have you ever considered taking up\nkung fu yourself?
I was impressed by\nthe monkey's skills and\nunflinching devotion...
Hoom... To think that they could take on a\ncorporation like that with only a single\nblade!
After avenging his father, I wonder what that\nsalesman will go on to sell next...
How enthralling! The two chefs were so close\nto being caught at numerous points,\nyet they always maintained their cool...
I suppose if they couldn't handle the\nheat, they wouldn't be in the kitchen!
I was amazed by the spies'\nproficiency, stealing secrets\nwithout being detected...
Hoom. While much of the technobabble went\nover my head, it was certainly quite the\nexhilarating story!
I hope that young man enjoys his life\nin the real world...
Wow! To think that stoic agent would take\nthat young girl under his wing...
Though in a way, I feel as though she helped\nhim as much as he helped her.
The bond that formed between\nthe agent and the girl\ntouched my heart...
"True justice means trusting in your\nmuscles..."
When you stop and think about it, it doesn't\nmake much sense... but it is persuasive.
I admired the cop's guts for\nbuilding himself into the\nmuscular arm of the law...
Though he may not have been able to save\nhis wife in time, his cure went on to save\ncountless lives around the world.
His desire was formed from love, knowledge,\nand passion... Marvelous, indeed.
It was only once the townspeople recognized\nthe pain in their hearts that they could\nfinally begin to rebuild from the war...
Perhaps that was the reason the violinist\ncame to the town\u2014to signal the true end\nof the war...
So he used that expensive wine as\ndisinfectant to save the father who\ndisapproved of their marriage...
The two of them gave up everything they had\nfor the sake of love... What a bold decision\nthey made.
The way the two boldly fought\nfor love in times of turmoil\npulled at my heartstrings.
My my, so the humans managed to fend off\nthe alien invasion. Impressive, indeed.
But how will Planet Earth survive without\nits moon...?
The deep sci-fi story really\nsparked my imagination...
I get the impression that much of the\nback-and-forth is improv...
...but the mystery itself is quite\nfascinating. I can see why people are\nsaying the film is interesting.
I was charmed by the\ncomedians' witty adlibs...
Good gracious. The ninja brutally murdered\nalmost everyone that crossed his path,\nall to reclaim his master's gold...
The corruption of wealth is truly something\nto be feared.
I could feel the young\nsamurai's bravery amidst the\ntense psychological warfare...
Who would have thought that the director's\nhip pain would be cured by belly dancing?
I suppose one is never too old to dance!
My heart was warmed\nby the depth of the\ncaregiver's compassion...
Though her cybercrimes were unforgivable,\nyou can't help but sympathize with\nthe poor idol.
Perhaps even AI idols long to be loved.
So the two mermaids were able to see past\ntheir scales and learned to love one another.\nHow heartwarming.
...Shame about the ship crash, though.
I was moved by the romance\nthat bloomed between\nTita and Nick...
My word. That blind agent's sense of smell\nis simply stupendous!
...But how did he know what aliens smelled\nlike in the first place?
I was floored by the blind\nagent's sharpened senses...
I can't believe they used the enemy's\nman-made planet to pull off such an\naudacious trick shot!
The gravitational force was strong in her,\nindeed...
It would have taken true\nskill to master billiards\non a galactic scale.
So the park became the domain of\nmutant pigs... Frankenswine's monsters,\nif you will!
I must say, I did find the part where the\nchild evolved by eating genetically enhanced\nbacon to be a little far-fetched...
I was shaken by the ingenuity\nof those clever little pigs...
So the pilot fulfilled his destiny and\nbecame the pharaoh of legend...
You know, the bond that formed between the\nman and the bird feels curiously familiar...
It must have taken real guts\nto ride into the danger zone\nlike that...
Spectacular... That little carrot uncovered\nthe arson plot that threatened to divide\nPlantopia.
Her passion to protect both fruit\nand veggies alike was stronger than\nthe hottest flames.
"Some like it cold." Who knew the prima donna\nwould say that as she gunned down the mafia?
That woman... She was far scarier than the\nmafia boss, wouldn't you agree?
I learned that charm\ncomes in many forms...\nboth graceful and deadly!
You say your gonna talk your way into taking over their ship...?\nYou've gotta be kiddin'! They'll never listen to ya!
One day, they'll tell tales of Captain Curly-Hair Anne,\nthe greatest pirate to ever sail the seven seas!
I'll confront their greed with knowledge!\nWhen I make a decision, I always see it through!
Bombing the capital will wipe out that rampaging gorilla... and the\ngovernment with it! But don't you worry\u2014I'll have this city functioning again!
That's your master plan!? Don't be so full of yourself!
The greatest threat to humanity isn't the gorilla... It's humanity itself!
It's all coming back to me...
I can feel it. The passion from our days training\nin the forest together... It's all flooding back to me!
Let's run! Don't fight that idol!
Why not? I've had enough of running away.\nAnd now I've finally realized what it is that I want...
This burning soul... yearns to be a superstar!
...But I'm nothing without my Spicy Suit!\nThere's no way I can slurp down those fiery noodles now!
Hmph! If you can't do it without your suit,\nthen you don't deserve to call yourself a hero!
C'mon, eat the spicy ramen! You're the friendly neighborhood food fighter\nwe're all counting on, aren't you!? Then stand up and start chomping!
You dare blame me for the stress of my employees?
I don't blame you, sir. I blame the company's\npolicies that treat people like machines.
The only way to bring about change is to reform the system and hire\nreasonable managers who put the wellbeing of employees first!
I've successfully infiltrated Sensei's subconscious!\nNow to find the answers to the test...
This is my mind, so you're going to play by my rules!
Sensei! Forgive me for my actions! I'll forget everything I saw,\nso please just let me out of here!
We're going to steal the world's biggest ruby...\nOne that's even bigger than a watermelon!
You mean we get to be thieves? Awesooome!
That's right, kiddos. You can use whatever weapons\nand gadgets and cool cars you like!
You drove off the bridge to save me... I owe you my life, brother!
Now, we've got an important job tomorrow...\nWe're gonna hit that armored truck and rob 'em blind!
Brother... The truth is... I'm a police officer,\nand I'm here to arrest you for that hijacking incident!
It's clear you aspire to rule the valley, but I will stop you!\nNow enough of this nonsense! Let's settle this in battle!
Zen-jou-in...? Preposterous... That secret technique was lost to time!
Oh, you've heard of it, have you? Mastering this move\nmarked the final stage of my training! Hiii-yaaah!
With my knack for sales and your talent for swordmaking, we can\ntake down that damn company and make money lying down.
Can I ask, who are you exactly?
I'm a humble salesman who plans to take over\nthat company and bleed them dry.
I had no choice back then. But now, I want to\ndevote myself to savory tofu pudding.
You're a spy who came here on your master's orders, aren't you!?\nYour love of savory tofu pudding is a total lie!
No, I truly do love them... but I'm also quite fond of sweet tofu pudding.
Cheating isn't the solution! To find the key,\nall you need is knowledge of the game!
I've got it! The password was the first ever easter egg:\nthe name of the game creator's dog!
Congratulations! A new Player None is born!
You're a national security agent? Wow... I think I'm swooning!
What happened to your family was unforgivable. I'll take you in,\nbut don't misunderstand; I'm doing it out of sympathy, not love.
You'll never be alone again... I just need to complete one last mission.
You set me up! I never took the money! It was you!
You're not a cop anymore. All the cops in the country are on\nyour tail and they're out to arrest you, not me.
Then I'll have to take the law into my own hands,\nand make sure that justice is served!
Dear, I don't have much longer... But I need you to understand\nthe difference between what's real and what's in your mind...
I won't give up... Not on my research, and not on your life!
Eureka! I've discovered a miracle cure for the illness\nusing the mysterious formulas of love!
Thank you for saving my life. How can I ever repay you...?
Thank music, not me. It is the wonder of music that\ngives us the strength to persevere through the war.
Please, at least tell me your name! I wish to hear you play again someday...!
I never sell anything without expecting something in return.\nYou desire wine, and well, I desire an extraordinarily beautiful woman.
If you think our country can afford your wine,\nthen I'm afraid you're sorely mistaken...
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a hoot.
Leave our planet and go back to Centaurus, you filthy vermin!
Those horrid humans...! Launch the planet generators!\nWe'll use them to propel the Moon back to our home!
This voyage across the cosmos will last 400 years... What awaits us we know not,\nbut our courage and perseverance will shine as bright as the stars.
Humans come into this world naked. Leaving it with even a pair of underwear\non is lucky. But it seems our vic has left with everything but his hat...
So either it was stolen by the culprit, or\u2014maybe,\njust maybe\u2014the victim misplaced it...?
Oh, c'mon! If you think the hat's irrelevant to the case, then just say that!\nOr doncha have the guts to admit to your mistakes!?
Heads or tails? Call it. If you get it wrong, you lose everything.
But if I'm right, do I stand to win all these gold coins!?
The longer you refuse to return what you stole,\nthe more you risk to lose...
Come on, everybody. Let's practice our dance moves to ring in the New Year!
But the doctor told me I can't leave from my bed...
...I can't believe it! They've all regained their vigor!\nThank you for bringing dance into this home! Please, I beg you to stay!
Dear Mr. President! What do you get when you piss off a psychotic AI idol\nthat's been abandoned by the internet and treated like malware?
Stop the livestream! Somebody get rid of this virus now!
You get what you deserve! For I am this country's one and only idol!
Stay back! If you come any closer, I'll throw myself overboard!
If you do, I'm gonna have to jump in there after you.
I can't believe you really jumped after me!\nDon't tell me... you're a mermaid, too!?
Sir! That woman is the vice principal of the school!\nShe was the one who threatened to have me expelled!
Kid... When you've lived in the dark for as long as I have,\nyou can detect a person's true nature from their scent alone...
And underneath that skinsuit is a translucent,\nfaceless, four-legged alien with glowing guts...
Fear... The order of this galaxy shall be maintained\nthrough fear of the Star Killer!
Is this... Slatewalker's cue stick?\nCan an amateur like me really wield it...?
You're holding it wrong! Just close your eyes\nand let your inner pool shark guide you...
Those mini-pigs have learned to teleport! Get rollin'! We've gotta catch 'em!
Say what!? Then it's going to take more than brute force to stop them!
What if we send the kid? He's evolved already,\nso this should be a piece of cake!
With the power of the sun in my hands, your fate is sealed. Prepare to die!
I'm always prepared... but I'm afraid I won't be kicking the bucket today!
Is that... the Storm Crow!? Impossible!\nHow can you control the ultimate Mecha Beast!?
Nothing's impossible in Plantopia!\nI'm gonna be a great firefighter someday, just watch!
That's what all the new plants say when they come here.\nJust give up on those foolish dreams already, you silly carrot.
No way! As long as I study hard, I know I'm capable of putting out fires!\nI'll make this city a safer place!
You want to match me, a Queen Swan?\nYou'll have to practice all night, lest you wish to remain ugly ducklings!
-Arabesque? You expect us to do that right off the bat!?\n-But that's impossible! Nobody's perfect...!
"Perfect" isn't all about skill. Adding a dose of charm is just as important!
Welcome, welcome...
You let me know if you want my help with anything!
Well... all right then.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate\nto ask!
As you can see, this is a place both strange and\nwonderful...
If you ask me, this place is a lot like them\nPalaces you've been to\u2014it's got that\nsame energy.
Looks to me like this is your very own\nPalace! How 'bout namin' it "Thieves' Den?"\nSounds fittin' for you and your friends!
And if you spruce this place up a bit,\nyou'll be able to do even more here...
You'll have more space to store things,\neven get the chance to meet some\ninteresting folks.
Put up some decorations, play some music,\nand this place will start to feel quite\nluxurious...
Do you want to decorate this place even more?\nWhy not head near the entrance, hm?
Simply insert your P Medals into the slot,\nand something wonderful will come out!
Then, you can place that wonderful something\nwherever you'd like.
But even simply owning such a wonderful\nthing will surely result in something good, though...
With this strange machine, you can listen to\nall sorts of songs.
Just a touch of those shiny letters there\nand your favorite music will start playing.
Get a load of those big, extravagant\npicture frames.
It must be a marvelous sight to see all the\npaintings lined up here. I'd love to see it.
If ya go out and create many memories with\nyour friends, sugar, perhaps we'll have\nsomethin' to display here!
There's some sort of mysterious tile\non the second floor...
When you step on it, you may find your\nappearance has changed... What a mysterious\nthing this is, hm?
The more people you meet, the more this place\nwill grow and change.
Here's where you can play Tycoon.
As a merchant, just hearing the name makes me\nhappier than a lily in a rainstorm!
Please try your hand as well, darlin'.\nYou'll be rewarded for your efforts!
How oddly relaxing... It certainly exceeds\nmodest expectations.
Juggling schoolwork and phantom thievery must\nsurely be taking a toll on you.
You should take this opportunity to relax and\nforget your troubles.
I often wonder...
Why do modern humans love to shorten\nwords so indiscriminately?
And by only a letter or two, no less!
It rarely makes a difference and, in fact,\nonly obfuscates the meaning!
Honestly, humans these days...
Come to think of it, we are still yet to\ndecide on our Phantom Thief names.
Perhaps there is something befitting of my\ngallant and robust nature?
My opinion is hardly the end-all be-all,\nhowever.
Please do give it some thought.
This place is awesome! It's so massive\nand comfy!
With this much space, surely we could fit a\nbatting cage or two in here, right?
Or maybe even a baseball stadium!?\nNah, that's a stretch...
They use code words to communicate in spy\nmovies and stuff, right?
Since we're Phantom Thieves, why don't we do\nthat too?
Huh? Will I remember the code?
That's uhhh... Well... Ahahahaha...
You're pretty skilled, {NAME2}.
The way you handle wires to infiltrate each\nPalace blows me away.
Not to mention, you're the one who makes all\nour break-in tools!
That sort of stuff is too fiddly for me.\nGuess you could say I'm kinda jealous!
I put on my swimsuit and everything, but...
We can't even swim here. This kinda sucks...
At the bare minimum, this place needs an\nindoor pool. Ooh! How about we make one now!?
Hey {NAME2}! When I say "summer" and "sports,"\nwhat comes to mind?
For me, it's Koshien Stadium and the sizzling\ndrama between Japan's top teen baseball\nstars at nationals!
Everyone giving each ball 110%...\nNow THAT'S youth!
Huh? Whaddya mean you've never been to Koshien!?
It hit me again that the cognitive world\nreally is something else.
Even wearing a swimsuit can change my\nPersona's abilities.
What if I try on other clothes? Will her\nabilities change again?
Ooh, now I gotta find out!
Hey, this place got a kitchen?
I wanna treat everyone to ramen,\nsince we're here.
But where do I even get the ingredients?\nWhatever, I'll figure it out!
Bein' a Phantom Thief is tougher than\nI thought.
Especially when we gotta hide from\nthe enemy...
I ain't a particularly stealthy guy...
But I made a commitment. I probably shouldn't\ntalk like that now.
Sorry. Forget I mentioned it.
Random question. Ain't it hard to juggle\nmultiple Personas?
I've only got Mandrin, so that ain't\ntoo bad...
But more than one sounds hella confusing.\nI don't think I could deal with it.
Hey, {NAME2}. You really know how to kick\nass without breaking a sweat.
What manner of place is this?
It feels like a Palace, yet the atmosphere is\nslightly different...
At any rate, I'm curious. It appears safe,\nbut I feel the need to investigate further.
I'd like your honest opinion.
Do you all think the support I provide in\nbattle is... adequate enough?
I'm doing my best, but there is always room\nfor improvement.
If you have any feedback, please do not\nhesitate to tell me.
As head of the Disciplinary Committee, I can\nonly somewhat empathize, but...
Leadership isn't easy, is it?
I'm sure you have your fair share of fears\nand concerns...
But do not bear those burdens alone.\nMy door is always open.
I find it difficult to relax under\nsuch circumstances.
Yes, my outfit is different. But I also feel\nboundless energy brimming within me.
I fear I may lose control if my mind drifts\nfor even a moment.
I have a rather strange question... How do\nyou like my new Thief outfit?
Hm? It's cute, you say? No, that's not what\nI meant...!
I only asked because I wondered if it was too\nflashy for a Phantom Thief...
Still, thank you.
Utilized properly, this power will be a\nvaluable asset to our cause.
But conversely, the slightest mistake could\nendanger everyone.
Please, {NAME2}, look out for me so that\nmy powers may never hurt anyone.
I have complete faith in your guidance,\n{NAME2}.
Honestly though, the beach house's food was\npretty expensive, wasn't it?
I know that, and I get that it isn't going to\nchange, but it's hard on a student budget.
You ate a lot of stuff there though, Motoha!
Hey! What do you expect me to do when there's\nso much yummy food right in front of me!?
And shaved ice is like 50% tastier when you\neat while looking out at the sea, too!
Not to mention that seafood ramen Shun\ntempted me into was amazing, too! Mmm!
Ahaha... Yeah, I understand. I even get\ntempted when I'm sending orders.
Like, "Aah, this looks so good, I'll need to\nget some for myself later!" Y'know?
Then I'd forget about how obvious a food\nbaby's gonna look in a swimsuit...
So you're saying you also gave in to the\nbeach house delicacies too, Tomoko?
What about you, {name2}? Is there\nanything from the beach hut you really\nlike to eat?
The toppings were arranged so nicely, it made\nme want to try all the flavors!
Yeah, comparing the different flavors was so\nmuch fun! My favorite was... Agh, I\ncan't choose!
Hehe, I hope we all get to go on another\ntrip like that next year, too!
Aaahh, {NAME2}-kun! Save me, please!
Eeeek! That woman, she's so... so peppy...\nIt's freaking me out!
You know Shichi-kun!? Are you a fan?\nI love Shichi-kun!
Oh, I see! Well, any fan of Shichi-kun must\nbe a good person!
And a good person's friend must also be\na good person... right?
Then, then... Why don't we all talk about\nShichi-kun together! It'll be great!
The acoustics here are perfect.
I bet it'd feel great to let loose and sing\nmy heart out...
Maybe I'll do that when no one's around.
A lot of people come by around here.
I'm not good at approaching people myself...
Luckily, they've been coming up to talk to\nme instead. I'm glad.
I should try to break the ice myself\nsometime though.
This place is so nice. It makes me want\nto stay forever.
I feel like I can express my thoughts and\nfeelings without putting up a front.
I think I can write some good lyrics or tunes\nwhen I'm here...
The sixth sheik's sixth sheep's sick...\nThe sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick...
I practice these sometimes so I don't mess\nup my enunciation while singing.
It's my secret talent, I guess. The sixth\nsick sheik's sick's sheep's sixth...
It's hard to play an instrument that's not\nmy usual guitar.
I bought a kalimba a little while back just\nto try it out.
The positions of the notes were so different,\nit took forever just to remember them!
Can you play any instruments besides bass?\nOr are there any you'd like to try?
Ooh, nice! I'd love to see you play sometime.
{NAME1}-kun, have you ever\ntraveled abroad before?
I've never set foot outside Japan myself.
I'm actually pretty good at foreign\nlanguages. The proof is in my college\ngrades, hehe...
But if I actually went abroad, I might get\ntoo nervous to talk to anyone.
Maybe I could do it if I had someone\ntraveling with me.
Next time you're planning a trip overseas,\nyou should take me with you.
Hm-hm hm-hmm<sprite=1 tint=1>\nHmhm-hmmm<sprite=1 tint=1>
Ack! Wh-When did you get here!?
Er... A nice tune just popped into my head,\nso I started humming it out.
I didn't think anyone was listening!\nGod, that's embarrassing...
Maybe I'll try using that melody for a\nsong then.
I was thinking of that bit as the hook...\nI'll have to figure out the rest.
Hmm... For example, do you think it'd work\nif I followed that part like this?
Oh, great timing!
That girl over there, that's Kotone Montagne,\nright? The figure skater!
Oh my god, what do I do!? I've never seen\na real celebrity up close before!
You know her!?
You seriously know a celebrity? That's...\nThat's kind of crazy to think about.
Is that... You actually know her!?
Huh? M-Me?
I've seen her before! Outside the theater in\nYongen-Jaya, practically swimming in cats!
Aw, that. Yeah, the cats in Yongen-Jaya\nreally love to come out and play.
Also, I've seen her performing outside\nShibuya Station. I often pass by.
What!? Oh... Oh, I, I see!
I usually try not to look at the crowd too\nmuch, so I never noticed...
I always wanted to say hi to you sometime,\nbut I never got the chance. Nice to meet you!
Oh man, I can feel my face burning up...\nIt's nice to meet you too! Haha...
{NAME2}. Have you been\nhoning your gun skills?
The key is to always visualize your aim.
When talking to people, I imagine lining\nmy sights for a head shot.
I'm joking. Why aim for critical hits at\npoint-blank range?
This place kind of feels like an arcade.
I'm not the type of person to get excited\nover the ambiance of a location, but I\ncould get used to this.
All we need is a shooting game cabinet.
Shooting games at the arcade are my forte,\nbut a real life fight with airsoft guns\nsounds pretty interesting, too.
Wouldn't it be fun if everyone here played\na round against each other?
I'm kidding. But as the backbone of this\ngroup, you should consider it.
I first got into shooting games to improve\nmy focus and concentration.
Both correlate to one's surgical skills.
However, it's now my biggest pastime.
Yeah. Even if I did quit medicine, you would\nstill see me firing away on that arcade game.
Lab coats are so convenient. It doesn't\nmatter what you wear underneath.
No need to coordinate outfits, plenty of\npockets, and not to mention multifunctional.
To say I became a doctor for the lab coat\nwouldn't even be an overstatement.
I'm obviously joking. Besides, you don't need\na license to wear the coat.
You should wear one sometime. Here, I'll let\nyou try mine on.
Did I tell you I have an older sister?
She says I'm different lately.
According to her, I seem to be enjoying\nlife more, whatever that means.
Nothing feels any different, but what do\nyou think?
Hmm, I see... Yes, before there were very\nfew people I could call actual friends.
It's fascinating to know our friendship\nhas changed me.
Are we really friends though? How would\nyou even define what a friend is?
I need to do more research and figure\nthis out. You're in this for the long haul.
Unlike me, you seem blessed with\nmany companions.
Does having lots of them truly make\nyou happy? Do numbers really matter?
Right, quality over quantity.
In that case, I guess I should thank my\nlucky stars.
How did a loner like me get to make such\na remarkable friend like you?
Conclusive evidence has proven so. There's\nno doubt you are a true friend to me.
It's not like anything will really\nchange, but...
{NAME2}, I want our\nfriendship to remain solid.
Howdy there!
This place is kinda weird, huh? There's\nall these people I don't really know...
That's why I'm glad to run into you!\nI was feeling a little anxious...
Good morning? Hello? Good evening?\nI can never tell what time it is here...
So you know what that means...
Yep!
The phrase to say is "howdy there"!
Oh, it's {NAME2}-kun!\nHowdy there!
What're you doing right now? Oh, are\nyou free?
Then why don't we chat for a while?
Hmm... This is a hard one.
Oh, {NAME2}-kun! That's my buddy\nfor you, always ready to help.
So, well... I'm having trouble deciding what\nto have for breakfast tomorrow.
Boom Bang Burger's morning set, or\nYang-Yang's AM combo... Which should it be?
Sometimes people mistake me for someone\nrich when I tell them I live in Shibuya.
But I'm not at all, you know! We've just\nhappened to own a house there\nfor generations.
The place is old, and it's not even close\nto being big.
You? Want to come to my place?
N-No! It's too soon for that! I need time\nto emotionally prepare!
I feel like more people are taking note of\nShichi-kun these days.
But sometimes I get this, well... chill down\nmy spine, you know?
I get a bad feeling that someone's trying to\nexpose Shichi-kun's true identity.
No, I'm not! I can feel it! Just yesterday\nafternoon, Shichi-kun's...
Oh, that wasn't coming from me, okay?\nIt's what Shichi-kun said yesterday!
So, there's actually been something I've\nwanted to ask for a while... Is that okay?
Yesss, thanks!
I was born and raised in Shibuya, so I\nlove it to death!
But why do you like Shibuya so much? I really\nwant to hear all the details on that one!
Because, well... I'm the type who loves\nhearing others praise the things I like!
Whaaat? Don't be like that! Please, I'll even\ngive you something nice in return!
Look! It's a limited edition, super rare\nsticker Shichi-kun gave out two years ago!
Hey, wait! Don't run away! Tell meee!
Isn't this place kinda like a nightclub?\nOmigosh, this is so rad!
I feel like dancing all night! Wanna join me?\nHaha, just messing around!
Oh, bummer! My nail polish is starting\nto peel!
Hey, is there a salon around here? Aah...\nI guess not.
This is such a BK. Oh, that's short\nfor buzzkill!
Wanna get dolled up tonight and head to\nGinz' for some yummy soosh?
It's important to treat yourself now and then!\nYou gotta stay fresh.
Oh, then we could belt our hearts out\nto some bangers down in Shibs!
Morning! How're you doing,\n{NAME2}-chan?
My skin has NOT been feeling it today. It's\nkind of lame, not gonna lie!
Plus the charms on my cell are falling off!\nLike, OMG, WTF!
Hah! You're always so funny,\n{NAME2}-chan!
All right, it's time to switch gears! Time to\nget groovy!
Hey, we gotta talk! Me and my hubby got\ninto an argument the other day.
We both got sooo PO'd that we didn't talk\nto each other for, like, two full days!
But we couldn't keep that up forever, so\nwhen I went to tell him how sorry I was...
...I found out he'd only gone and bought\nme my favorite cake!
I was this close to falling right back in\nlove with him, for realsies!
Hey, {NAME2}-chan? Are you like,\nactually super popular or something?
Sometimes I see you talking to people and\nit's like, where are you even from?
Wow, are you sure you're a high schooler,\n{NAME2}-chan? You need to seriously\ntake a chill pill.
Then again, I guess people might see me\nand think, "Who's that cute tanned chick?"\nRight?
Hey, so be real with me. Do you have\na GF right now, {NAME2}-chan?
What, are you embarrassed? You don't have\nto hide it from me!
I'm sure you must have a lady friend or two!
I think it's great! Get out there and fall\nin love while you're young, y'know?
I met my hubby pretty early in life,\nyou know.
But if we'd met just a little later, I woulda\nbeen loving it up all over the place!
Whaaat? You're so innocent,\n{NAME2}-chan!
But listen, I'm always here to give love\nadvice! Just leave it to moi!
Wait, did you injure your hand?
Even if you're feeling fine now, don't get\ncarried away and hurt yourself, okay?
I'm really impressed by how accomplished\neveryone here is.
I should follow their example, y'know?\nLike help out with my dad's shop more.
And study more... Mostly study more...\nReally study more...
*sigh* Maybe someone here can tutor me?
Hmm... Do you think alcohol is really\nthat tasty?
Dad and the regulars drink it every night\nlike it's really delicious or something...
Just to be clear, I've never had alcohol.\nNot even a sip!
No drinking until age twenty, no sir!
Little kids really have so much energy!
I was playing tag with them at the park, and\nwe were running for an hour straight!
Hehe, well, it was nice to get some\nreal exercise in.
I am exhausted, though!
I was watching TV with the usual kids\na while back...
They were running all around the room,\nand making a huge ruckus too.
But the second cartoons were on the\nscreen, they'd stop in their tracks\ninstantly!
I swear they didn't move an inch until that\nshow was over.
I could see the sparkle in their eyes! They\nwere really cute, actually!
My school friends recommended this foreign\nTV drama, and I binge watched the\nwhole thing.
It was interesting, but then the story got\nso heavy it was hard to watch...
The ending was so hopeless and depressing\nit actually left a bad taste in my mouth.
Guess it wasn't really for me.
Yeah... I never really thought about it, but\nI'd say I prefer bright and uplifting stories.
Something with a lot of laughs, and a little\nsomething heartwarming at the end.
Say, do you know any good shows or movies\nlike that?
The neighborhood kids are staying over\nat my place this weekend.
What kind of food do you think little kids\nwould want?
Oh, that makes sense! The kind of stuff\nyou'd see on a kids' menu!
My dad always wants to serve the kids\npickles from his shop.
They might go well with sake, but I don't\nthink little kids would find them tasty...
Hmm... I guess that is an option.
It's not really for me to decide what those\nkids will or won't eat.
But I do want to try and make something\nthey'd like, regardless of what my dad says.
Oh, why don't you come? You can eat with\nus too!
So this is the fortress of the\nchosen ones...
It's truly splendid, {NAME1}-san. As a\nkindred spirit, I am truly proud of you!
Now that we've secured our base, we must\nprepare to face the threat!
To be honest with you, I've always wanted a\nsecret base.
Somewhere your parents can't just barge in\nand make you clean up, you know?
Do you think we could add a book corner?\nThat way, we could really strengthen\nour noggins.
Feel free to reach out if you ever need me.
As a kindred spirit, I vow to always stand\nby you.
Remember, you're never alone! As long as\nI'm still standing, at least.
I know this is a bit out of nowhere, but do\nyou read much, {NAME1}-san?
I see. I personally consider myself an\navid reader.
If writing is the greatest human invention,\nbooks must embody our species' sapience!
{NAME1}-san, do you read\nlight novels at all?
I see. I read a fair number of them myself.\nLibraries stock them these days.
Sadly, there are some that are prejudiced\nagainst light novels based on their genre\nand cover art.
To those people I would like to say, please,\nlet go of your preconceptions and try one!
{NAME1}-san, when buying books,\ndo you prefer physical or digital?
I see. I was a staunch believer of\npaperbacks myself...
But now I'm running out of space and my\nparents want me to get rid of them.
With that in mind, having them all on an\napp makes it way more convenient. I can\nread anywhere!
However, I still love flicking the pages by\nhand! And the smell of old books\nis wonderful!
Oh, but if I go digital, I can get new books\nthe minute they come out!
Ahh, I can't seem to decide...
{NAME1}-san, do you ever read\nparallel world novels?
I see. I read a good few myself. You don't\nhave to worry about running out of them\neither. The genre is seemingly endless.
The stories tend to follow a template, so\nyou know what you're getting.
Usually the protagonist dies, is reborn in\nanother world and becomes OP.
On the other hand, when you pick up a book\nyou know nothing about, it might not go well.
Say, the story takes a depressing turn, or\nthere's a sudden tragic ending.
Which is fine if you're going in prepared\nfor that kind of story!
But if I'm reading something to have a good\ntime, why break my heart!?
Were they trying to betray my expectations?\nWell, now I don't expect ANYTHING from them!
Right! I-I apologize. I got too excited.
My point is, the appeal of parallel world\nstories is the promise of certain victory.
Especially for us chosen ones, for our own\nbattle guarantees no such promise.
Oh? Are you free, Sensei?
Lucky me, then.
I'd appreciate if you could help me out.\nYou see, there's a word I've been\nwondering about...
Ah, Sensei. Fancy bumping into you here.
Oh, right. I'd like you to lend me an ear.
I can't, for the life of me, come up with the\nright gift to give to a friend.
I just know you'd know waaay better\nthan I would!
Sensei! Sudden, I know, but do you like\nbrown sugar syrup or vinegar and soy sauce\nfor tokoroten noodles?
Even in China, we have more gelatin-based\nsweets than you can shake your stick at.
Tokoroten noodles may have the completely\nopposite flavor profile, but they taste\nsimple yet profound.
Oh, Sensei. Your timing never ceases\nto amaze me.
The honorific prefix in Japanese can be\npronounced as both "o" and "go," right?
I can't make tails or heads of how to\nfigure out which to use...
Hmm... I see. I feel like I'm getting closer\nto understanding but am still oh so far away.
Anyway, I guess I'll just have to hit the\nbooks. I'll do my best!
I just realized that daikon radishes in Japan\nare really big.
At first I thought it might be tough and\ntasteless, but that's not the case.
You usually cook for yourself, right? What\ndo you make with it?
Mmm-mmm, good. It sounds like an\nessential item on the Japanese dining table!
I enjoy daikon radish in oden or paired with\nmiso, but one day I'd like to try\npickled takuan.
Pickling it myself seems like a hassle, but\nit's all about the experience, right?
Eating gyoza with rice is such a Japanese\nthing. It's what pops into a lot of Chinese\npeople's minds when you hear "Japan."
The yakisoba pan sold at the convenience\nstores are quite the spectacle, too.
Oh yeah. At this point, who even knows\nwhat's a main dish and what's a side?
But I wouldn't say I dislike that side of the\nculinary experience here.
Sure, traditional Japanese food steeped in\nhistory is also great...
But, no matter the combo, only your tongue\ncan be the judge! I think that's wonderful.
Oh, Sensei. I received a care package from\nmy parents, and it was full of scrumptious\ntea.
I want to share it with you since you've\ndone so much for me.
Do you like white or black tea?
Well, white is made from only the new buds\nof the plant, and it's light and refreshing.
On the other hand, black is fermented over\nmany years and has a strong taste and aroma.
But it's probably quicker to just try them\nthan to listen to me explain.
I'll make some for you on my next day off.\nWe can brew both and do a taste test!
In that case, it would be good to have both\nheavy and light snacks...
Please find some sweets that you think will\ngo well with it, Sensei!
Oh, wow, look at you. That suits you nicely.
Oh...! Th-Thank you so much! I've been as\nbusy as a bee lately with celebrations\nand such...
Mmm-hmm, I see. You should make the most of\nwearing stunning outfits like that while\nyou're young.
There are some styles that you can only\nget away with at your age.
So now's my chance, huh. As someone with\nexperience beyond my years, I'll be sure to\ntake your advice to heart.
That said, I'm not saying that fashion no\nlonger matters once you get older.
Someday, you'll reach the age when your\naesthetic will also mature like fine wine.
I don't want to become a miserable old wretch\nwho has no motivation to do anything.
Thank you, but don't go trying to butter\nme up.
If you've got compliments to spare, maybe\nyou should throw a few her way?
You'd have better luck with her than with me.
Oh, no, Sensei. There's no need to start\nfussing over me all of a sudden.
But hearing what Chizuko-san has to say\nmakes me feel a whole lot better.
There are so many kind people here\nin Japan...
Even if they don't always express themselves\nall that clearly.
Is that so? Well, I'm the type to just say\nwhat's on my mind.
I'm happy to hear that. Plus, it's also a\ngreat opportunity to learn. Please, tell\nme more!
Oh, welcome... I mean, hello,\n{NAME2}-kun and Yaoling.
You're in college, aren't you, Yaoling? Are\ncocktails popular with the kids in China?
Actually, I found a rather interesting recipe\nthat uses Chinese wines such as Shaoxing...
That's right. I came here to study abroad\nright after graduating from high school.
I come from Sichuan, which is famous for\nmaking a strong alcoholic drink called\nbaijiu.
Unfortunately, I'm still not allowed\nto drink.
I see. Well, that can't be helped.
Ah... But you like tea, don't you? I think\n{NAME2}-kun mentioned that before.
Yes. Actually, I'm making an effort to try\nmany things, not just tea and the usual\nstuff they sell here.
Kyushu's kuma tea, Okinawa's sanpin tea\nmade with Jasmine leaves...
Great, that might work. I could make you\na non-alcoholic cocktail, or a "mocktail"\nin other words.
There are a lot of recipes that use tea\nas a base with added fruit or mint.
I think both you and Yaoling will be able\nto enjoy this one, {NAME2}-kun.
Oh, I see. Rather than a substitute for\nalcohol, it's a new way to drink tea for me.
I would love to try it to see how it captures\nthe true essence of the tea's flavor!
Okay, got it. I'll keep the ingredients in\nstock so I can make it whenever.
Thanks to you, Yuumi-san, I'm expanding\nmy horizons more than ever before!
Hey, fancy meeting you here.
Are you hungry by any chance?
Want to go get something to eat once\nyou're done here?
This is such an unusual place.
Something about it is calming, though.\nIt really feels very "you" in here.
Oh, wait. That came out weird.
I noticed there were other people here,\nso I thought about talking to them, but...
How do I break the ice?
I don't want to screw up my first impression\nand make them think I'm an antisocial weirdo.
Did you know that flowers can have both\npositive and negative meanings?
For example, what do you think yellow casa\nblanca lilies represent?
That's exactly right. I'm impressed.
Actually, yellow casa blancas can symbolize\nboth joy and betrayal.
Some often take them for the latter meaning,\nso it's said they don't make for good\ngifts, but...
I wish that more people would see them for\ntheir positive meaning.
So, about the language of flowers...
Did you know that according to the language\nof flowers, a watermelon means "thick\nand heavy"?
I guess it's more influenced by its fruit\nthan its flower.
Watermelon flowers are these cute and tiny\nlittle things.
You think so?
Hmm, now that I'm hearing it from you,\nmaybe you are right!
As far as a flower that matches its\nmeaning perfectly goes, do you know what\ncoffee means?
Coffee flowers mean "let's take a break."
Coffee's the perfect thing when you want\nto relax for a moment, right?
Oh, that reminds me. I found a great coffee\nshop the other day.
Would you like to go?
Yeah, of course!
Oh, and since I'm the one who invited you,\nI'll take care of the bill.
You can borrow my book about the origin of\nthe language of flowers if you want.
Customers ask about their meanings all the\ntime when you work at a florist.
I think it wouldn't hurt if you went ahead\nand learned some of them.
Oh... Then I can teach you myself when\nthere's downtime at work.
That'd be okay, right?
If that's the case, I'd better brush up on\nmy studies myself.
I can't be giving you wrong information,\nafter all.
...And that's when I knew my opponent had\nno way of turning the tables!
I see, I see.
So I leaned in and told them...
"Too bad, but that was your final turn!"
Wow, that's so cool!
Oh, it's nothing serious. Just telling\nAshiya-san about some of my old battles.
Kurotani-kun says he's good at card games.
Apparently the goddess of victory loves him\nso much that she even grants him the power\nof destiny.
Well, it's what you might call my\n"destiny draw."
Oh, I've heard of that one before. I play\na lot of card games myself.
I'd love to play against you some time. When\nwould you be free?
You'd rather not?
No, it's just... It'd be rude for a\nfirst-year student like me to challenge\na third-year.
Really? I don't think so.
I-If the two of us face off like this, I'm\nnot sure my destiny powers will really\nactivate...
Huh? Oh, I get it! I'm sorry! Yeah, you'd\nstart feeling nervous!
Oh! I-I know, why don't the three of us play?\nWe can find a time that works, and\u2014
Yeah, that'll give me time to prepare... Er,\nnot that destiny requires preparation!
Great idea! You're right, it'd be more fun if\nall three of us played together!
You know how some places are quite busy,\nyet surprisingly cozy and welcoming?
Whenever I come across a spot like that,\nI start to picture it as a nice little\nreading nook...
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just thinking\nabout something.
Whenever you find a spot to relax, the\nthoughts just bubble right up, don't they?
I always get nervous when strangers\napproach me looking to start a\nconversation...
But everyone here is so nice, I feel much\nmore comfortable.
Maybe I should try being the one to approach\nthem sometime?
Hmm... I don't know...
Oh, yes... I received a box of mini cakes\nfrom some relatives recently.
I appreciate the gesture but, with my dietary\nrestrictions, there's no way I can eat them.
I'm not sure what the best course of\naction is.
I've been getting a lot of requests for\nautographs lately.
Hrm... I'd like to oblige you, I promise.
But, I don't really have a proper,\ndistinctive autograph.
I've always just written my name in cursive\nas best I could...
I feel like people will be disappointed with\nsomething so plain-looking.
Say, what kind of style do you think would\nbe good for an autograph?
There's something I've noticed while chatting\nwith people here...
The things figure skaters think of as common\nknowledge aren't actually very widely known.
Hm, like for example...
The edge of your skates' blade... You know,\nthe part that touches the ice?
Well, it's not flat, and it's not sharp like\na regular blade either.
It's indented in an arch shape in the middle!\nYou'll see if you look at one yourself.
You set your weight on one side of the arch\nto turn when you skate into a curve.
Did you know that?
Oh, {NAME2}-kun... No, it's\nnothing like that.
I passed some girls earlier who were\ndiscussing their favorite caf\xe9s.
They just kept talking about which cakes\ngo best with coffee.
And they all just sounded so good... *sigh*
I really do love sweets. Like the little ones\nmy coach gives me as a reward from time\nto time.
But you have to keep to a very strict diet\nto be a figure skater.
Ah... I wish I could taste all those\ndifferent cakes, too.
Oh, yes! We should absolutely do that\nwhen we get the chance!
I haven't had much time to relax at home\nbecause a competition is coming up.
A lapse in concentration is the last thing\nI want while I'm performing...
I'll need to rest whenever I can.
It's pretty tough when I need to study for\ntests and practice skating at the same time.
The school is flexible when it comes to my\ncompetition schedule, but still...
I need to study more efficiently... *yawn*...
I was out running an errand near the\nmovie theater in Yongen-Jaya the\nother day.
Did you know there are batting cages nearby?
They're up a flight of narrow stairs.\nI couldn't believe it when I found them.
Why don't we go there together sometime?
A classical piece I recognized started\nplaying in a video on my feed.
But I just can't remember the name. It's on\nthe tip of my tongue...
Oh, wow! I didn't know you could search\nfor it like that!
Although I'm always using my phone, I never\nknew that was possible!
Maybe I'm just not photogenic...
I was running out of pages in my passport,\nso I got it renewed the other day.
I took an ID photo for it, but...
The way it came out, I barely recognize the\nperson I'm looking at.
Does that happen to anyone else?
I've been drinking lemon-flavored soda water\nafter practice lately.
But I couldn't believe it when I saw all the\nother flavors they make online.
Pineapple, strawberry, green apple...\nThey all sound delicious.
We should try them together some time. I'd\nlike to sample lots of different flavors.
Apparently they used to say that drinking\ncarbonated water was bad for you...
But my sports physician said it was all about\nwhen and how much you drink.
Lately some people even say it's good for\nyou, but apparently drinking too much can\nnegatively impact your health.
When it comes to enjoying food and drink,\nit's important to be aware of what you're\nreally putting into your body.
I get lots of flower bouquets from my fans\nat the end of a competition.
Getting flowers really does lift one's heart,\ndon't you think?
Well... Lately I have had trouble knowing\nwhat to do with all the flowers I've been\ngetting.
I decorate my home with them, or place them\nby the entrance to the skating rink...
But these days I get so many I've run out of\nplaces to display them.
I just can't bring myself to toss them out\nbefore they start to wilt, though...
I wonder if there's something I can do\nwith them?
Good idea... It's not very common to find\nyourself overwhelmed with flowers.
Maybe taking up a new hobby so as to not\nwaste them is a good idea.
Ah... Those clothes are so lovely! I wish I\nhad your fashion sense!
Word up! We were just talking about\nKotone-chan's sense of style!
She just showed me her competition costumes\non her phone too...
Can you believe these? They're so rad!\nShe's like fashion incarnate!
Thanks. I'll let my designer know next time\nI see them.
You must hire some super-famous designer\nconsidering your level, right?
Oh, no, I go to the same specialty shop in\nKichijoji that I've always used.
Kichijoji... Wait, could you mean the store\nthat's near the jazz bar?
You know it?
That designer is super talented! Anyone who's\nin the know has heard of them.
They're, like, my idol! No wonder you look\nso amazing!
Oh, I never knew they were so famous!
Wait, so how old are they now? They looked\nto be only in their thirties at most...
Feels like a secret base for a team of\nsuperheroes. Not bad.
All that's missing are the boarding gates for\neveryone's personalized mech.
You'll be the red ranger, right {NAME1}?\nI want to be blue or black then!
Red's not really my favorite ranger color,\nactually.
Red's usually the main hero, sure, but\nI think support roles like Blue are\nreally cool.
A rival role like a Black Ranger's real\nrad too!
Action scenes are where stuntmen shine, so\nI want to build up my stamina.
Could I use this place for running or\nweightlifting? You wouldn't get mad,\nwould you?
Okay then... I'll just think up names for my\nmoves instead. How's Justice Blast sound?
What's your favorite type of live-action\nhero, {NAME1}-kun?
Heroes that fight together as a team of\nrangers, or ones that bash heads solo?
Cool! I don't think I could pick one over\nthe other, personally.
The idea of fighting evil alongside your\ncomrades gets me real excited.
But there's plenty to admire of an unnamed\nhero who battles on alone with no one to\ncheer them on!
I do think you're more of a Red Ranger than\nanything else.
You're quiet, but I can picture you leading\nyour friends in battle, y'know?
The outfits live-action rangers have to wear\ncan be so tight, every contour of their\nbodies can be seen.
That means they can't get too fat or too\nskinny, since they all wear the same suits.
But there are times when the show looks for\nmore diverse actors of different builds\nor height.
Some roles require a tall actor or a short\none, y'know?
Back in the day, there weren't a lot of\nfemale live-action rangers, right?
So back then, a lot of female characters\nwere just played by short men!
You'd never know if someone didn't tell\nyou, right? That's the charm of the stuntman\nbehind the mask!
In my case I'm of average height and build,\nso I don't really stand out there...
But you could also say it makes me versatile.\nI could fit a lot of different roles.
{NAME1}-kun, have you ever seen\nShichi-kun in Shibuya?
It really makes an impression, huh?\nDefinitely caught me off guard the first\ntime I saw it.
But actually, I'm more interested in the\nperson inside that suit.
Not just anyone can move and perform like\nthat in that kind of outfit!
Maybe it's actually a famous actor...\nI'd love to talk to them sometime.
But, even as an aspiring costumed stuntman,\nI can't just talk to them if they're on\nthe job.
So if you ever hear anything about\nShichi-kun's actor, fill me in, okay?
You know, you're a pretty mysterious guy.
Sorry, it just slipped out. I didn't mean it\nin a bad way though.
A lot of people say I'm not the kind of\nperson I look like... in a bad way, y'know.
It gets really annoying. I end up expecting\nthe same reaction from everyone.
I thought that you might be similar to me\nin that way.
But you're always acting natural. You don't\nput yourself down to praise others.
I think that's... I guess I'm kind of\njealous, to be honest.
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about!\nUgh, I can't win.
Anyway, I think what I'm trying to say is...\nI'm glad we're friends.
So I'm looking forward to seeing where\nour future ventures take us, {NAME1}!
The aura I sense from you... It's very\nsimilar to that of a chosen one.
A chosen one? Yeah, I wanted to be something\nlike that once.
But I found a goal for myself in this world,\nso... I guess I wasn't special.
I see. However, I still perceive radiance\nfrom you even in this state.
{NAME1}-san! Please, try to match\nthe tone of the conversation!
Haha! You're fun. {NAME1}-kun always\nkeeps good company, I guess!
No, no, I should be saying that. Wait, could\nyou be... another kindred spirit?
A kindred spirit, huh? I like it! I'd love to\njoin your group!
Of course! Even if you aren't a chosen one,\nwe can still face our battles together.
Thanks. I wish I'd met you and\n{NAME1}-kun earlier.
Hah! It's not too late yet. Time is on our\nside, after all.
{NAME1}-san! Please, you're supposed\nto be our intermediary! Your job is to\nintroduce us to each other!
We've made it this far into the conversation,\nbut we still don't know each other's names!
Haha, that's true!
I'm Leo Kamiyama, currently in training to\nbecome a costumed stuntman! Nice to\nmeet you.
I'm, uh, Kiyoshi Kurotani... currently a\nchosen one.
Hello, {NAME1}-san.
There seems to be quite the number of\npeople here. Do you know them all?
I have much to learn from your example.\nI'll need to apply myself to be more\nsociable.
Ah, {NAME1}-san. How are you doing?
I've been feeling slightly tired as of late,\nbut I'm making do with some ginger and honey.
I recommend a mixture of honey and lemon\non toast. I'm sure you'll find it to satisfy\nyour cravings in many delightful ways!
Oh... What am I going on about? In any case,\nI just wanted to say, I highly recommend\nhoney.
Some stop eating when they find themselves\nbusy, while others eat more to relieve\nstress.
The question of how to defeat both calories\nand stress is an eternal one.
The temptation of something sweet when I'm\ntired is quite something. It's a battle\nI fight daily.
Oh, {NAME1}-san. I'd like to speak\nwith you.
I saw someone who went to "borrow" an\numbrella during a sudden shower.
When I pointed out that they may be\ncommitting theft, they froze up...
Were my words too harsh?
I suppose you're right... It's not always\nabout being correct.
It made me realize I need to be more flexible\nin my thinking and careful with my words.
The term "modus operandi" refers to the\ntrademark behavior of a criminal that can\nbe used to link them to multiple crimes.
Outside the legal system, people tend to\nuse "MO" casually to refer to their habits\nand guilty pleasures.
But given its original meaning, I can't help\nbut feel taken aback when people use it\nlike that.
Do you have any similar phrases that make\nyou feel that way?
Ah, yes. There are many terms and phrases\nmistakenly used in that way as well.
One usually hesitates to correct others\nabout them, though. You just have to stew\non it.
The word "faith" means to believe and trust\nin something that may not be based on proof.
Yet the legal concept of "good faith" means\nto uphold a standard of honesty and integrity\nwhen dealing with others.
Good faith and fair dealing also extends to\nthird parties too.
I agree. But this is the sort of knowledge we\nneed to work matters out between people.
Everyone may wish to call themselves good,\nbut its definition varies greatly from person\nto person.
The concept may seem uncaring at first, but\nin reality, it helps us respect one another.
At times, I'll compare my way of thinking\nto those of others.
It makes me think that I'm too constrained\nby insisting on formal correctness.
But after having interacted with those who\ncome to different conclusions?
I now realize that some value only the ends,\nwhile others value the means as well.
That difference strikes me as something very\nimportant in and of itself.
Heh heh. Yes, something like that.
I enjoy speaking with you because you see\ndepths that I cannot...
I imagine it won't be long until I find a\nconclusion I couldn't have reached alone.
I hope to be able to spend more time with\nyou for that to happen.
My, she seems awfully proper for someone\nyou know, {NAME1}-kun.
She kind of reminds me of a teacher I had in\nmiddle school. She even gets me nervous.
I do get that from time to time, yes...
You know, you might lose sight of what's\ntruly important if you're too by the book.
Think you could relax a little more? At least\nwhen you're around me?
What's truly important... Indeed, you may\nbe correct.
I'm glad to hear your thoughts. I shall\nstrive to keep it in mind going forward.
Heh heh heh. I'm sorry. It was just a\nrefreshing lesson to receive...
I spoke that way intentionally because I\nthought it'd be amusing. My apologies.
Huh, okay then. I think you'll be just fine.
You have a lot going on inside. It's not\nlike you're putting on a fake mask.
You don't seem to be unconsciously trying\nto act like some authority, either.
Are you sure? I do feel as though I am\nputting up quite a front...
Well, anyone's gonna be a bit wary talking\nto an old lady like me.
In any case, let me correct what I said at\nthe start here.
You're no ordinary girl. Just like someone\nI'd expect {NAME1}-kun to know.
Should I take that as a compliment? I do\nfeel as if you've given me some form\nof approval.
I am. No need to feel intimidated. Take my\nwords however you like.
{NAME2}! I don't know where\nwe are, but it looks fun!
Let's explore together!
I wonder what mysteries await us?\nI'm so excited!
Hrmmm...
I'm thinking up a hard quiz.
Once it's ready, you'll be my first\ncontestant, {NAME2}!
Perspective is key to solving a puzzle\nor quiz.
Simply changing your mindset can spark\ntotally new ideas!
If you're stuck,{NAME2}, try thinking\noutside the box!
{NAME2}, do you know the story\nof Shibuya's Buchiko?
Yes, that one! Rumor has it that...
The statue takes walkies in the middle\nof the night! Is it true?
I want to see for myself, but Mom said I'm\nnot allowed to roam about outside when\nit's dark.
So, I want you to check out Buchiko at\nnight for me!
{NAME2}, does your school\nhave clubs?
Lucky! My elementary school doesn't have any.
If we did, I'd join the Explorer Club!
Oh, I know! Since we don't have one, I'll\nmake my own!
Will you join my Explorer Club, {NAME2}?
{NAME2}, do you know\nShibuya's Shichi-kun?
So you do know! Isn't Shichi-kun the cutest?
It always waves when my friends and I\nare exploring!
Shichi-kun doesn't even mind Kyo-kun's\npunches and kicks!
Still, Shichi-kun is full of mysteries.
And someday, I will uncover them all!
Hey, hey! {NAME2}, what's your\nschool like?
Wow! I'd love to go there!
But after elementary school, I'll be\nattending college in America.
I guess we won't get to go to\nschool together...
Wait, really!? Yaaay!
Actually, I'm kinda scared to go to the US.
But if I have you,{NAME2},\nI'll be just fine!
*stare*
Hey, {NAME2}. Little help?
Go get your eyes checked. I'll introduce you to an optometrist I know.
Are you a doctor, mister?
Well, kind of. I'm still in residency.
Amazing! Doctors have to study lots, right?
I'm Haruna, and I love studying, but I don't\nthink I have what it takes...
Haruna? As in Haruna Nishimori?
That's me! You've heard of me before?
My work is buzzing about the kid genius\nHaruna Nishimori.
I'm no genius.\nDoctors are way cooler!
Look at you, charming your way to making\na friend like that.
I can't believe it,{NAME2}!\nYou're friends with a doctor!
Oh, hello!
Umm...
Eheh... Never mind. I'm just happy to see\nyou is all!
Hmm... What part-time job should I try\nout next?
Is there any place you'd recommend?
I don't mind hard work, either! I'm stronger\nthan I look!
Hee hee. It'd be nice if we got the chance\nto work together again, too.
This is a strange place.
It's somehow exciting and relaxing at\nthe same time...
I wonder why.
Hey, {NAME1}-kun, what's your\nfavorite kind of cr\xeape?
Or, what kind would you most like to eat\nright now? Just curious about your tastes!
Oh, I see, nice! I could go for one of\nthose, too!
Maybe next time I work at a cr\xeape stand\nI'll practice those, just in case!
I get a little nervous whenever I talk to\npeople at work about sports.
It's always awkward if it turns out our\nfavorite teams are rivals or something...
But if I mention I used to play baseball,\nthey always ask what pro team I like!
*sigh* I'm never sure how to answer when\nthat happens...
Yeah, you're right. It's not like I support\nteams just to get into fights over them.
Thanks.\nI'll try doing that from now on.
Hmm... Maybe some adventure is just\nwhat I need?
Oh, {NAME1}-kun, I've got\na question...
Whenever you spot a strange-looking drink\nin a vending machine, do you buy it?
I see... I always end up going for the\nsafe option instead.
I do think it might make a fun story to try\na weird one, but I never go through with it.
Next time I see it, I'm definitely gonna try\nthat oyster sauce cider!
Hey {NAME1}-kun, so, I've\ngot a question...
Which do you think are better, glasses\nor contacts?
I've always worn glasses, so I think I'd\nfeel kinda weird going out without them.
Anyway, I just thought I'd ask for a\nsecond opinion, so...?
Really!? Y-You think so? Th-Then maybe\nI'll go with that...
I've been thinking about my style lately,\nnot just the glasses, but like, hair\nand clothes...
I work at a bunch of places but, well, I've\nknown you for a while. Thoughts?
You think so? Well, um, thanks...
Let's gooo!
Hi, {NAME1}-kun!
Noge-san was just getting me hyped up!
Things have been kinda rough lately, and I\nwas feeling down...
Then Noge-san came and asked me what\nwas wrong!
I know how it feels to be going through\na lot, you know? So I had to reach out.
We just talked a little about some of the\nstuff we've both been through, that's all.
But speaking with Noge-san, I realized\nI don't have time to spend feeling down!
Which means I need some energy! Like a\ngood dose of hype!
So she asked me what I do when I need to\nmotivate myself, and... well, I take a deep\nbreath, and shout...
Heck yeah, that feels great! Why don't you\njoin us?
Hehe, good idea! C'mon, {NAME1}-kun,\nall together!
Did I have a little too much to drink?
How did I end up falling asleep in a place\nlike this?
Then again, the atmosphere's not bad.\nIt kind of reminds me of a jazz bar.
At least this place doesn't seem to have\nany wacky drunks around...
No brutes looking for fights, either. That's\na relief.
Once you're old enough to start drinking, you\nneed to be careful about where you do it.
Also, you should never get too drunk. Even if\nyou're drinking to forget.
Maybe to you my love for jazz might seem\nlike something you'd expect from someone\nmy age.
But you know, what they call pop music\ntoday was at its height even when I was\na kid.
Jazz is like a true hobby to me. It's never\nbeen about what's in fashion.
It would've been sixty years ago when I was\naround your age...
Right around then, the world started to\nbecome a lot freer, but also faced its fair\nshare of troubles too.
But I'm not a fan of people telling me that\nI turned out like this because of when I\nwas born.
You can't stand it when people say "all\nyouths act the same," right?
Yeah, that's exactly it. You're pretty good\nat firing back at someone.
You know, I bet even diversity and universal\nprinciples come and go with the times.
When I was young, people liked to get\ndead drunk to show how they really felt.
But are we really ourselves only after we\nlet loose with some alcohol?
Of course, I did start drinking back in\nthose days...
I'm not the classiest drinker, but it isn't\nthat easy to understand someone's true self.
Some drink to spit up what's bottled up\ninside of them. Others drink to bottle\nthings up.
People drink for different reasons.\nI suppose alcohol\nis a bit like a screwdriver.
Try to live nice and long until you're as\nold as this granny here...
Watching the world change around you\nisn't the worst feeling, you'll come to find.
I had a time when I thought it was cool to\nbuck authority and stick to my beliefs...
But perhaps it's wiser to find a way to\ncompromise with others in a way that also\nbenefits yourself.
Live long enough to see it all and you won't\nbe a slave to your instincts.
Well, that's the tricky part. While you may\nget a good view of the path ahead by\nclimbing a tree...
You gotta come down to walk it eventually.\nThat was the case for me as well.
I struggled a lot back in the day. There are\nthings I've gained and also lost...
Before I know it, I'm already a granny.\nThese days, there aren't many things\nI still cling to obsessively.
I think that's normal though. But now that\nthe world's a more prosperous place...
Young people these days just don't know what\nthey should yearn for. Must be difficult.
Others can't go and tell you to start wanting\nthings. That's not how desire works...
Oh yeah? You think I shouldn't kick back\nand relax now that I'm retired, huh.
If that's how you feel about it though, maybe\nyou're right.
Okay, no need to hold back. You're gonna\nhelp me out too, you know.
You're okay with that, right? Then\nlet's start...
{NAME2}-kun, do you mind if I practice\nmy flair tricks here?
It goes without saying that I won't be\nmaking actual cocktails, of course.
And if I spill anything, I'll be sure to wipe\nit right up. That's good with you, right?
I'm trying to come up with a new cocktail\nrecipe but nothing's coming to mind.
If I don't narrow things down a bit first,\nthe cost of ingredients can get quite high.
Also, if I keep tasting what I make, I'll end\nup totally smashed by the end.
And then the recipe gets lost to the ages.\nAll that hard work for nothing...
The names they give to cocktails can be\npretty wild, don't you think?
Bloody Mary, Screwdriver, and the like...
They all sound like wrestling moves.\nDon't you just want to scream them out loud?
The flair bartending that I do also includes\nduo performances.
So, why not give it a go with me,\n{NAME2}-kun?
I'm kidding! Sorry, I just thought it\nwouldn't hurt to ask, that's all.
Everyone's going to get the wrong idea if I\nwere to do it with someone your age.
Maybe I'll ask you again when you're\na little older.
Female bartenders are sometimes\ncalled barmaids.
I feel like in Japan, the word "maid" has\na very strong image associated with it.
When you hear "barmaid", doesn't a maid\noutfit come to mind?
Huh? Are you saying you've got a thing\nfor maids, {NAME2}-kun?
Wait, does that mean there's demand for it?\nMaybe a full-on maid bar could work...
No! That's not gonna happen! Get your mind\nout of the gutter!
The other day, I saw a girl doing a puppet\nperformance on the street in Shinjuku.
She was pretty young, probably about your\nage, but her performance was beyond\nher years!
Flair bartending is also a type of\nperformance, so I found it really inspiring.
It's not like we're competing directly. What\nwe do is very different.
But, seeing someone so young work hard\nreminds me that I have to work hard too!
I wanted to give her a tip but I didn't have\nany change on me.
So I tossed her a ten thousand yen bill instead!
Not that I regret it or anything, but now\nthis month's looking a little tough...
Are your parents strong drinkers,\n{NAME2}-kun? Or are they lightweights?
Well, some kids end up weak to alcohol\neven with parents who drink a lot.
The opposite can be true as well. Only time\nwill tell how you'll turn out.
No worries though! Even if you're not the\ndrinking type...
I can always whip up a mocktail! Drink with\nme when you're of age, okay?
C'mon! No matter how I drunk I get, I'll only\never show you my cool side.
You can bet on it! For sure...\nI think? Maybe?
Yeah... I might be a problem, so I'll teach\nyou how to take care of me, okay?
The cost of living is so high these days!
Food, electricity, heating... No matter how\nI try to cut costs, it all keeps adding up.
Maybe... I could just live here instead?
I don't want to assume, but...
Do you actually know everyone here?
What incredible networking!
This could be a good place to practice\nwith my marionettes!
Aaah, but I'd get in the way if I tried to\nset up all my stuff here, though...
Guess I'll just practice in my head for now.\n'Kay, time to get in the zone.
Oh, I get it!\nI should try that...
I'm renting a room, but recently I've picked\nup so much stuff that it's getting pretty cramped.
So I decided to look up videos on how best\nto organize it all.
I'm gonna go buy a storage rack right\nafter work tomorrow!
Aaah... It's so nice to relax.
My main job and side gig have both been\nsooo exhausting lately.
But when I decided to call it a day and let\nmyself unwind, it's like all the fatigue\njust melted awaaay.
Ah... But I think all this relaxing's making\nme hungry.
Ah... What a calming space you have here!
My room these days feels so tiny\u2014it's been\nforever since I've had space like this!
Say, does this place have any beds?
I think it would definitely be better to\nhave some! You'd sleep so well here!
It could also use a bath, massage chairs,\nmaybe a manga-reading corner...
I'm usually putting on shows with my puppet\nhere, but I've been thinking...
Maybe I should try some new type of\nperformance from time to time?
What do you think would be good?
Oooh, yes!\nThat's a great idea!
I could get a whole new outfit too. I'm sure\nit'd be a huge hit!
Well, if that's what I'm doing, I'd better\nplan it out right away!
I love how easy it is to wanna try new things\nwhen I'm with you!
Hee hee! Thank you! I hope you'll come\nto all my shows!
Oh, hey.
Feels like it's been ages, but also like\nwe just met the other day.
What's up with that?
I've noticed that you never fail to greet me\nwhenever we cross paths. You really are a\npolite one.
Hmm, but maybe having such a kind attitude\nis what draws so many people to you?
I should watch and learn from your example.
Huh? You need something?
Not that you need to have a reason to talk\nto me. I didn't mean it like that.
I'm just not the type to strike up\nconversations with others, so I thought you\nwere going to break some news to me.
So... Did something happen?
What should I do...?
Oh, {NAME1}! Perfect timing.
I was just pondering what book to\nread next...
Should I read a short story or push through\na good chunk of a longer novel?
Hey, {NAME1}. People always tell me\nI'm too serious.
But, is that a bad thing? Do people prefer it\nwhen others aren't serious?
Right? I suppose it depends on the situation,\nbut I wouldn't even know where to even start.
You should do what you think is right instead\nof trying to please people and regretting it.
You've got to check out this book!
It's by an author I deeply respect\u2014the debut\nnovel of Toshia Soomy!
Anyway, it's a really good read. And a new\nedition came out, so I had to upgrade!
Well, the cover's different, but the inside's\nexactly the same.
But I read my old copy so many times it's\nfalling apart.
I was already thinking of buying it again,\nand then the new edition came out.
I knew it was meant to be, so I bought\nfive copies.
Now I know I'll never have to worry about\nthe wear and tear!
Remember when I told you I bought five of\nToshia Soomy's books?
Since then, other authors have re-released\ntheir books with new cover designs.
I'm happy, of course, but... I'm also running\nout of money.
At this rate, five of each is a bit too much\nfor my wallet, so I'm settling for only three\nfor now.
But that's when it dawned on me...
I used to be happy with just one copy. But\nafter buying five, three just isn't enough.
If one gets too worn out, then I only have\ntwo left...
Not that I regret buying those five copies.
But I fear I might have ventured too far\ninto forbidden territory.
Ugh, I just need two more copies, that's all!
Oh, hello. So, I made a little mistake\nat school...
I understand rationally that it's no big\ndeal, but still...
Hey, Sumi-san, what do you do when you're\nfeeling depressed?
I don't often feel down in the dumps, but\nwhen I do...
Guess I just block it out with booze...
Yup, drown myself in hooch till I've\nforgotten whatever was bothering me.
Well, drinking till morning's enough to wipe\nyour memory of just about anything.
I can't say I recommend it... But maybe\nthere's a lesson to learn in there somewhere?
Well, for now I know there's no point\nin worrying.
I don't know if what you said was useful,\nbut I can see that my situation isn't so bad.
Haha, harsh words! But as long as I could be\nof help, that's all that matters.
Um, that wasn't supposed to be praise. And\nI'm definitely not following your example!
Didn't expect to run into you here.
Or maybe it's not so unexpected...\nWho knows? Hehe.
Another nice day.
Nothing going on, nothing to do...
My favorite kind of day. Know what I mean?
Well, if it isn't {NAME2}.\nYou doing all right?
I'm... fine, I guess.
But being fine is pretty stellar in my book.
No one's going to come looking for me, which\nmeans no problems or issues.
It couldn't be more peaceful... But\nsomething's missing.
I just miss the fishing pond.
I think throwing my line in the water there\nis my favorite thing in the world.
I bet a lot of girls like you.
Knew it. I can always tell with stuff\nlike that.
Throughout my life, I keep bumping into\npeople who do good deeds for me.
Like the random stranger who gave me a\nsnack a minute ago.
It'd be mean to reject them, so I\naccepted it.
The world really is full of good people.
The other day I was at the fishing pond as\nalways, and some guy came up to me.
He told me his whole life story and then\nburst into tears.
I was a little taken aback.
Said he was the CEO of some company, I think?\nHe thanked me so much I felt bad.
But that wasn't all.
Later he asked if I'd become a board member\nat his company!
It was hard to turn him down, haha.
Do you have a favorite author,\n{NAME2}?
Oh, really? I never buy a book because of\nthe author.
I choose what to read based on what the\nbook is about.
There are some authors I read more often,\nbut that doesn't mean I like all their books.
I do end up reading every book by certain\nauthors, though.
To me, choosing a book by its author is\nlike gambling.
It means you're buying a book without caring\nwhat it's about.
I see. Maybe that's what it means to be\na fan.
I learn so much from talking to you.
I couldn't care in the least.
Really? Not what I expected. You really got\nme thinking, though...
I was just getting advice from Sumi-san. You\nsee, I have trouble keeping my distance\nwith others.
I tend to give people presents or treat them\nto meals even when they're my senior.
And I said I don't care about things\nlike that.
If someone prepared something special\nfor me...
It would be ruder to turn them away, right?
I see, I see... You've been very helpful!
What? You think so?
But I feel like he made all my worries\ngo away...
He's so friendly and open minded. You don't\nfind people like him easily.
Whoa now, you're going too far with the\npraise. I'm nobody special.
Anybody would be happy to receive a\nthoughtful present from you, Masaki.
I meant what I said.
Sumi-san...
Haha, sorry. I went a bit too far, huh.
I shouldn't go accepting expensive gifts from\nhigh schoolers... I guess?
Hmm... For my next job...
Maybe I'll try something a little different!
I wonder if any place interesting\nis recruiting?
I really loved the beach house!
A place where you can fully enjoy the\nmoment and soak in the summer air...
Hehe! Makes me wanna go back!
Customers stare at you if you wear anything\nunusual to work...
It's kind of embarrassing, but it's also fun!\nI could get used to it...
Er, not in like an exhibitionist way\nor anything!
It's not like that. Promise.
I've been pigging out a little too much on\nthe staff meals at the beach house...
So, now I'm trying to think of good ways to\nlose that weight again... Ahaha...
{NAME1}-kun, what flavor of syrup\ndo you like on your shaved ice?
Oh, I like that one too! It's so good!
Plus, you get your tongue dyed a fun color\nwhen you're done, haha!
Oh, that reminds me!
Some people say those syrups are actually\nall the same flavor, just different colors.
Do you think that's true? I swear they\ntaste different!
There's something appealing about a job\nyou'd only get to do at the right place\nand time.
Stuff like beach houses that only pop up\nfor one season and then disappear again.
I'd really like to do something like that\nagain, so I've been searching.
Which do you think would be better to work at,\na Shinto shrine or a traditional inn?
Hm, yeah, I thought you might say that...
Okay, sure! I'll try that.
Ugh... This is why you should never\nforget sunscreen.
I forgot to put on sunscreen before work\nthe other day...
Without it, I burn as red as a\nboiled lobster!
At least playing baseball, I'd be shielded\nby my hat and uniform...
Ugh, sorry. It's kind of embarrassing to be\nseen like this...
Oh, r-really?
That's a relief... Haha...
B-But, I still need to be careful next time!
Hey, Wonder.\nGood job out there.
This place is pretty cozy, and at the same\ntime, somewhat familiar...
Sorry. That was a weird thing to say. Just\nforget it.
Oh hey, Wonder. Sorry, I was just lost\nin thought.
I was just thinking about brewing coffee...\nThe blend, the process and what dessert\nI would pair it with...
Talking about it is making me crave a cup.\nHow about we go grab one later?
Are you looking for something?
Just looking around? In that case...
Mind if I tag along? That display piece looks\nlike the perfect spot for a Phantom Thief\nto hide.
Yo, Wonder! You showed up too, huh?
This place is pretty strange, but meeting\nyou in this form feels like a bit of a bonus!
This place... It feels different from\nMementos or any Palace. Kinda mysterious,\nyou know?
I wonder if that display piece has anything\nto do with it? Hmm...
Well, I'm not sensing any threats here, so I\nguess we'll be fine.
But just what does this thing symbolize?\nFill me in if you know.
Anyway, now that we have some downtime,\nhow about I teach you how to be a real\nphantom thief?
Listen up. A true phantom thief is a\ngentleman of class\u2014elegant, stylish, and...
...as stunning as Lady Ann! Heh, got it?\n...What's with that skeptical look of yours?
Ahh... I can't decide...
Wonder! You came at the perfect time, man!
I was thinkin' of ramen for dinner. Should I\ngo with shoyu or miso?
Yo, Wonder! What's bonkin'!
Hmm? What does that mean? It's kinda like...
"Good morning," "how are ya," and "stay\nfresh" all jumbled together.
It's a personal greeting! So, what's bonkin'?
This place is super weird, but it's really\nbig, huh.
I wonder how long it would take to sprint\nfrom wall to wall...
All right! I'm gonna gun it! Wait, am I gonna\nget in trouble for running indoors?
Goooood morning, Wonder!
Wait, is it still morning? Should I be saying\ngood afternoon?
Well, whatever! What matters is that I said\nhello, right?
This place has, like, a glamorous vibe to it.
But it's not as intense as a Palace, so it's\nactually kinda cozy here.
I'm in my Phantom Thief clothes, but there\naren't any Shadows. It almost feels like\nd\xe9j\xe0 vu.
Oh, I know! It's like a Safe Room!
Ugh... What to do...
Huh? Ah, no! Don't worry! It's not like a\nserious problem or anything.
I was just wondering what dessert I should go\ntry next... Wait, why are you laughing?
So, you're here too, Wonder.
This place sees its fair share of unfamiliar\nfaces\u2014ample material for observation.
Seeing someone I know brings a certain\nsense of relief. By the way... may I sketch\nyou?
Hm? That installation... Is it new?
Such tumultuous emotions... and yet, there's\na faint light, sinking deep within.
Fwahaha! Inspiration hits! My muse...
There isn't a moment to lose! I need\nmy brush! Wait, where is it? Oh no,\nit's missing!
This place is truly peculiar. Even though\ntime passes, I don't feel myself getting\nhungry...
But rather, a longing to eat... A certain\ncraving, if you will.
Oh, that's it! With these numbers, how about\nhot pot? And we can finish the soup by\nadding rice afterward.
I see, I see. So strength isn't the key...
Yeah. It takes a while before you get the\nhang of it.
No, we're actually talking about shaving\nbonito flakes.
I want to try making my own ramen. I heard\nSoy is an authority on the subject.
Well, I'm still just an apprentice...
Don't be so humble. You've taught me so\nmuch already.
Glad to hear it, but I need to improve\nquickly so that I can teach others.
Actually, if there was a kitchen here, then\nwe could all practice and teach each other.
That'd be nice. Maybe I could show you\nhow to make curry, too.
Don't worry, you'd be on taste-testing duty.
Hmm... But there are a lotta people here,\nso you might have some competition for\nthe role.
Right. And just between us, Panther\nloses it when it comes to sweet stuff.
No kiddin'! I have a pretty big sweet tooth\nmyself.
Baking desserts is just a hobby of mine, but\nI'd love to get Panther to try a bite.
And Mona loves sushi, by the way.
Sushi is bit high-end, but if I had a\nkitchen, I'd try. Can you arrange for one?
Grrrrr...
I refuse to allow such a trivial matter\nescalate into an undignified debate!
All I wanted was to open your eyes to the\ncorrect way of the world.
Oh wow, so this is how you think it ought\nto be, huh? Your world must be a total mess!
Meat is a staple for every special occasion!\nImagine the succulent flavors you are missing!
No way! It's all about fish! Has this\nlemur-wannabe even tried sushi?
I have, indeed! I suppose you are yet to know\nthe sumptuous taste of meat on the bone?
Been there, done that! I had more than my\nfill at Noir's house!
And yet, I'd choose fish any day! One vote\nfor sushi coming right up!
Grrr...!
Hmm. You raise a fair point.
You're right. It was selfish of me to get so\ncarried away.
What Wonder says goes, I suppose. I'll give\nyou your temporary ceasefire.
Well, I suppose a hearty bowl of ramen\nwouldn't hurt. That juicy pork... *shlurp*
Hey, that looks super heavy...
I don't think it is. Wanna give it a try?\nOh, wait. Might be a bit risky to do here.
I'm talking about the weapon that Soy uses\nin the Metaverse. I mean, a Gatling gun!?
We were talkin' about weapon mastery and\nthe conversation kinda blew up.
When I said it wasn't heavy, I wasn't\nreferring to the weight...
But do hippos really weigh that much?\nThey'd flatten you in an instant!
As fun as it is to talk about hippos... I was\ntalking about the gun I use.
It's big and looks pretty heavy... but in the\nMetaverse, it doesn't feel that way.
Does this also have to do with cognition and\nwhat not? Wind might know more about this.
Who gives about the details? It's awesome\nyou can easily use somethin' so cool.
But you use that badass shotgun, too, right?\nThat's impressive, if you ask me.
For real!? But... There aren't any Shadows\nhere. Maybe it's best to give it a rest\nfor now.
If we ever end up fighting together in the\nMetaverse, it might be fun to try it out.
Oh yeah, it's a deal! Weapon swapping and\nstuff like that sounds unreal!
Have you ever randomly got a huge craving\nto eat a certain food?
Oh yeah! Like you suddenly want to eat\nsomething even without watching a food\nvideo or anything!
Right!? In fact, I've got something in mind\nright now.
But here's a question for you! What is it\nthat I want to eat?
It could be pretty much anything! Hmm. Give\nme a hint at least! Is it sweet?
It's sweet... Well, to me at least!
Umm... Okay. It's a cr\xeape! One of those\nbanana custard ones!
Sorry, but no.
Here I was thinking it was one of the\nobvious ones! Hey, Wonder! Any ideas?
Wrong! But now that you mention it, I\nwouldn't mind one of those right now...
The correct answer is...\nmiso-flavored peanuts!
That's right! Its sweet and salty flavor is\nirresistible! But... how did you know?
I wasn't thinking about them, but thanks to\nCloser, I'm now craving them myself...
Oh man, I might not be able to think about\nanything else now!
Heh, heh, heh. One more casualty for the\ncause! Ahhh, I really want some!
Panther, got a minute?
Sure. What is it?
I wanted to ask you about your weapon.\nIsn't a whip kind of difficult to use?
Is there some sort of trick to it?
Hmm, good question... To be honest, at times,\nI just enjoy lashing it about.
I mean, it's not like I'm using a whip in my\neveryday life, right?
Not to imply that you're using rifles or\nswords on a daily basis, either.
So true. Being in a phantom thief outfit\nallows you to pull off moves you can't\nusually do.
I, for one, have never once fought by\nthrowing an umbrella before.
Gifted with the whip? I'm not sure if I\nshould feel happy about that or not.
I know! Why not try using a whip, Wind? It\nmight work out in the Metaverse!
Wh-What!? Hm... Maybe I should take you\nup on that?
It'd be easy to use somewhere this open.\nAim, strike... and yell out your catchphrase!
L-Let me hear you squeal!
A sketch? You mean one of those sessions\nwhere I'm not allowed to move?
No, you can move all you want. Actually, it's\nyour motion that I want to capture.
But there's no kitchen here, so all we can\ndo is have you mimic the movements.
You want me to pretend I'm boiling ramen?\nKinda like air guitar but with a strainer?
Right. It might be more convincing if you\nhad tools, but that'd be difficult to\ndo here...
Well, will you do it for me?
Sure. I'm not cool with stayin' still, but\nI'm game as long as I can move.
Also, I'm always drainin' water and shavin'\nbonito flakes. I can do it in my sleep!
Okay! Let me know if something's not\nworking for you, Fox!
Why're you talkin' like I'm your apprentice?\nWell, whatever. You'll see!
First, I'll start with the straining motion.\nHa, ha, ha! Haaah!
Ohhh! Just as I expected! Expertly honed\nmovements... This is exactly what I wanted.
Fwahaha! It's coming along! And rather\nswimmingly at that! Wooo!
Oh, hey! Do you happen to have anything\nto write with?
Yes! I mean like a pen or a pencil,\nanything really...
I see... That's a shame. I guess I'll just\nhave to memorize it somehow.
But... But... This is my big chance!
Queen's lessons are so easy to understand!\nEven I can remember everything...
Or, so I thought... It turns out that\nlistening just isn't enough!
Oh, I see. Okay, then! Let me give it a try!
Thank you, Queen!
Seriously. You and Closer both have\noutrageous appetites...
I was just talking with Queen about\nplum dishes.
Yes. Our main product is umeboshi, but we\nalso have a restaurant that specializes in\nplum dishes.
Also, although we can't drink yet, there are\nsome stores that specialize in plum wine.
Of course. It helps relieve fatigue, making\nit popular with athletes.
Then I'll bring a selection of drinks next\ntime. That way, everyone can taste and\ncompare them.
The refreshing, tangy flavor of the plum\nmakes it goes well with fluffy rice. Shall I\nask Soy to make it for us?
If I had even some tech knowledge, maybe I\ncould learn to manipulate computer systems\nlike you, Oracle?
For example... hacking open a locked door.
Apprentice!?
Very well. The desire to learn is important.\nThis is not something you can pick up\novernight.
Please, Oracle. Teach me everything you\nknow about hacking!
Yeah, I suppose. Sorry. I just thought I\ncould support the team like you do, Oracle.
Thank you. I will try to support everyone in\nmy own way the best I can.
Whoa, you have a home garden?
Big vegetables, huh. Sounds great! I bet\nthey're really filling!
Oh! If I had some of those carrots and\ntomatoes, I could make a dish I really love!
You guessed it! It's delicious and has\ntons of tomatoes in it!
Rata... what?
All this talk is making me want to grow\nsome greens of my own!
Sure thing! Though I'd prefer it if we could\neat them all here together.
I know! How about growing a vegetable\npatch here?
Okay, that settles it! I'll go look for\nplanters, seedlings, and a kitchen!
B-Beautiful, huh... You're really making\nme blush...
Not you, too...
I, myself, never thought I'd end up looking\nanything like this.
What if your phantom thief outfit happened\nto change like this, Noir?
What do you think the design would be?
Me? In Queen's outfit!? I wonder if I could\nseriously do it justice?
Hehe, it might be fun to try on each others'\nphantom thief costumes someday.
Violet is an honest person, so I think she\nsaw what she says she saw.
Violet claims to have seen a figure with\ntwo heads.
She claims to have seen it over there. And\nshe mentioned it was slender.
A temporary detective team? Sounds fun.\nCare to join, too, Wonder?
The challenge is to eat a burger bigger than\nyour face within the time limit.
Anyway, Violet was talking about wanting\nto try it.
Well, I was certainly shocked the first time\nI saw one of your lunches...
Yes. I may resemble an owl of sorts.\nWhat of it?
Yes. I myself am able to fly. Only my outward\nappearance bears similarity to an owl.
Therefore, I am capable of flight.
Don't lie so brazenly! I can fly!\nI always could!
However, I sometimes think it'd be nice if\nI could fly in the Metaverse as well...
For example, acquiring an item that's up\nhigh can be quite the challenge.
Correct. Nothing gets past a detective\nlike you, I see...
It is quite embarrassing to tell the truth...\nSo, would you mind putting me down?
There are indeed many to choose from...\nBut the first thing that comes to mind\nis frankfurters.
Regular frankfurters are good, but the\ngrilled ones are the best. They're\nhooting sublime!
Of course! There are some things you can\nonly understand by refining your palate.
What's the matter, Violet? You seem to be\nmaking a strange face.
I must say, there are certain things I\nrefrain from doing in plain sight.
My reputation as a Phantom Thief would be\ntarnished if word were to spread!
Why, hello there, sugar. Welcome!
Come closer. Don't be shy now!
I have excitin' news for ya.
I betcha wonderin' what all this is, huh?\nWell, I've already gone and done a thorough\ninspection for ya!
Ain't no denyin' that there are lots of\nopportunities to be found here\u2014including\nexpandin' the range of my services!
Allow me to give you the full tour.\nCome along now!
Ah, so good to see ya, sweet pea!
I've been lookin' forward to seein' you\ncome by here!
Sure was. I was certain that you were gonna\nstop by. Call it a hunch!
Now, ain't this just a sight to behold? It's\nso wonderfully strange... right?
That's not all! I actually feel the same aura\nfrom... well, you, sugar pie!
Looks to me like this is your very own\nPalace! How 'bout namin' it "Thieves' Den"?\nSounds fittin' for you and your friends!
Well, darlin', I whipped up a bunch of real\nnice surprises just for ya.
Now that's just plain cold, doncha think?
I've been bustin' my chops to give y'all the\nbest customer experience I could... I guess\nthis ain't what y'all were lookin' for...
I guess it's time to roll up my sleeves\u2014I\npromise to work my darndest to clear up all\nyour doubts!
That's right, if anythin' catches your\nattention, you can count on me to tell you\neverythin' ya need to know about it!
Ah yes, you have an eye for value, doncha!
This here is the Den Maker, and it's\nchock-full of all sorts of weird and\nwonderful finds!
As I'm sure you'll agree, this place could\ndo with a splash of personality. Doncha\nthink it's a little... barren?
But that's where this here Den Maker comes to\nthe rescue! I'm positively sure it's all you\nneed to make your Den a home.
From costumes to furnishings... Anything\nyou desire can be purchased here!
Oh, no! You don't need cash. Instead, it\ntakes these P Medals!
Simply insert your P Medals into the slot,\nand I promise somethin' real nice'll\ncome out!
Since this entire place is yours for the\ndecoratin', you can arrange your displays\nany way you want!
That sums everythin' ya need to know about\nit. Now all that's left is to try it\nfor yourself!
So first I do this...\nThen I press this button...\nAnd last but not least...
Yes, looks like I've still got it! Ah... \nnothin' beats a sweet servin' of Marthym's\nstellar customer service!
Ah, good timing. I was just thinkin' we could do\nwith some music.
Well, this is the first time I'm seein' one\nof these, so... bear with me while I figure\nout how to explain it!
Let's see now... simply touch the screen\nthen select the name of a song...
And it'll start playing some tunes! Now\nain't that somethin'?
Your turn! Go ahead and give it a whirl.
Hm... What have we here? I've never seen\nsuch a contraption before.
Perhaps you know what it is?
Movies, huh? Oh, I've heard of those! Them\nmachines with big spools of film that go\nround and round...
Hm? It seems to be missin' a place to put\nthe film in.
Seems to be a load of buttons on this thing.\nI'll just go ahead and press 'em!
Well shoot... I s'pose this is probably more\nyour area of expertise so... I'm gonna leave\noperatin' this thing to you!
Ah... ain't that a massive showstopper! This\nhas got to be the most gorgeous picture frame\nI've ever laid eyes on!
What do you think of it?
You said it... \nI don't know why it's all by itself.
I've tried everythin' I could to get a few\nmore, but... I've not had any luck.
Y'know what, sugar? I'm gonna need your help\nto turn this into a gorgeous gallery burstin'\nwith beautiful snippets from your life!
Your job is to go out there and make\nloads of good memories for this collection!
I'm looking forward to seeing what\nheartwarmin' moments'll be captured\nhere forever!
C'mere, sweet pea! I got somethin' to\nshow ya!
Does this look familiar?
Yup! Your very own dedicated Tycoon\nplaying area!
Just like in your Companio, you can play\ncards to your heart's content here.
Who knows? Maybe switchin' up the scenery\ncould give your games a whole new vibe!
Why not play a match right now, sugar?
Over here looks like the way up to the\nsecond floor!
I've got a hunch that somethin' mighty\nincredible is up there...
Well, I sure would love to take ya up there,\nbut I just can't!
There seems to be some sort of invisible wall\nkeepin' me out...
Butter my biscuit, looks like you're able to\nget through! I just knew you had a special\nconnection with this place!
Whatever it is up there, you're gonna get to\nsee it with your very own eyes!
Aaand it looks like we've covered everythin'.\nIf ya need somethin' else, I'm just a\nshout away!
Ah, there is actually one last thing...\nThe shelves!
As you make this place grow, I'll give you\ngifts to help ya fill out them shelves!
Consider it my way of sayin' thanks for\ngussying up the place.
Through your continued support, I'm certain\nthis place'll bloom into somethin' wonderful.
Ah... Oh, yes, I almost forgot.
While I was inspectin' this area earlier,\na guest suddenly turned up outta nowhere.
They looked like one of them friends of yours\nthat you go out adventurin' with.
Thing is, when I offered them a friendly \nhello, they suddenly disappeared!
Maybe you'd be able to talk to 'em?
Sorry, pumpkin, but I ain't seen 'em today...
You should make sure to say hi to them next\ntime you see 'em!
I betcha somethin' good'll come out of it!
Well, then, that concludes the grand tour!\nAnd as always, thank you for your patronage.
Oh my! What a coincidence, running into\nyou in place like this.
Where are we!?
So... This is like... your pad?
It's, um, how should I put this...
Very unique!
Hello there!
...Sorry, but could you please return\nthe greeting?
Let's try this again.
Hello there...<sprite=1 tint=1>
Payappa! <sprite=1 tint=1>
Gather 'round, gather 'round! It's time for\nI, Yui, to answer all your questions!
Let's start with... You, over there!\nFire away!
B-But why!? This is your big chance to to\nask me anything you could ever think of!
Ah, I suppose I did catch you off guard.\nMake sure to be ready with a question\nnext time!
And now for the moment you've all been\nwaiting for: question time! Just ask\nme anything!
Go on, ask away!
Oh my! Do I look like a high schooler to you?
Ah... Hm.
No comment. Moving on!
Anything... except questions that make me\nsound like a high schooler!
Why, potatoes, of course!
You can roast them, mash them, and even throw\nthem in a stew! Growing them is fun, too!
A life without spuds is truly terrible\nto imagine!
Don't you agree?
I accidentally let Yui drag\nme into her antics...
Now, it's time for ME to ask YOU questions!
My question is... What is your favorite\nvegetable?
Of course, of course, just the reply\nI expected!
I'm a fan of potatoes myself! In fact, it's\nmy favorite food altogether!
We really are two potatoes in a pod!<sprite=1 tint=1>
Now it's time for the goodbye greeting.\nSay it with me!
Well done!<sprite=1 tint=1>
I joined Yui as she waved\nto thin air...
Oh my! Sounds like someone's in a pickle.
What on god's green earth happened!?
Oh! Are you trying to say that you're\nlacking energy?
In that case... I recommend a good helping\nof vegetables!
Heh... Helping people help themselves...\nto helpings of vegetables!
He he he, dang I'm good, or should I say,\nI'm unbeetable!
Well, if you say so, then... Hmmm?
You, the one shaking like a rabbit. Is that\nShichi-kun you've got there?
Yes, I know Shichi-kun. I keep one at the\noffice\u2014ahem. Allow me to rephrase.
What I meant was, a friend of mine who works\nin Shibuya keeps a Shichi-kun on her desk.
Yui, Runa, and I had a lengthy\ndiscussion about Shichi-kun...
Ayaka and I practiced\ntongue twisters together...
We talked for a while longer\nabout musical instruments...
I talked with Ayaka about\nforeign countries we'd like\nto visit someday...

Ayaka, Kotone, and I laughed\nabout what a small world\nwe live in...
Kira and I talked more\nabout shooting games...
Kira and I further discussed\nthe benefits of lab coats...
Kira and I discussed the\nmeaning of friendship...
I listened as Kira openly\ntalked about being friends...
In the end, Runa wasn't\nable to decide...
Runa steadfastly refused my\nrequest for a home visit...
Runa remained convinced of\nhow much danger Shichi-kun\nwas in...
Runa kept begging until\nI told her everything I love\nabout Shibuya...
I'm not entirely sure what\nshe's saying, but that's\nTomiyama for you...
Tomiyama kept gushing over\nher husband for what felt\nlike forever...
Tomiyama seems as\nlaid-back as ever...
Tomiyama ended up asking\nme even more prying questions\nabout my love life...
Minami and I talked about\nthe struggles of looking\nafter kids...
Minami and I chatted about\nthe joys of watching\nover kids...
I recommended some\ncomedies to Minami...
I told Minami about\nmy favorite dishes...
Kurotani and I had a lengthy\ndiscussion about reading...
Kurotani and I chatted\nabout light novels...
Kurotani and I discussed\nthe pros and cons of printed\nand digital books...
Kurotani recommended a number\nof parallel world stories...

Yaoling and I continued talking\nabout daikon dishes...
Yaoling and I came up with\nsome examples of typical\nfoods in Japan...
Yaoling and I made plans for\nour next tea party...
Yaoling, Chizuko and I talked\nabout maturing with age...
Yaoling, Yumi, and I talked\nabout Chinese tea-based\nmocktails...
I ended up agreeing to play\na card game with them...
Kotone and I discussed what to\ndo with all those cakes...
The two of us designed a\nnew autograph together...
Kotone kept the figure skating\nfacts coming...
Kotone and I discussed what\nkind of cake would be best to\nget with coffee...
Kotone seems to have managed\nto find the song name in\nthe end...
Kotone and I talked at length\nabout the intricacies of\ntaking passport pictures.
Kotone and I had a spirited\nconversation about our\nfavorite drinks...
Kotone and I continued to talk\nabout what she could do with\nthe flowers she receives...
Our conversation about\nKichijoji's legendary designer\ncontinued well after that...
Kamiyama and I talked about\nlive-action heroes for\na while...
Kamiyama shared his vast\nbehind-the-scenes knowledge\nof live-action hero shows...
Kamiyama told me his theories\nabout the person playing\nShichi-kun...
Kamiyama and I reaffirmed\nour friendship...
Kamiyama, Kurotani, and I\npledged ourselves as\nkindred spirits...
Yukimi and I ended up talking\nfor a while about how to be\nmore considerate...
Yukimi and I shared our\nfeelings about misused words\nthat are hard to point out...
I got a sense of what Yukimi\nis thinking by talking to her\nabout legal terminology...
Yukimi seemed unaware that\nshe was being quite bold. I\ngave her a vague response...
I introduced Yukimi to\nChizuko. They seem to get\nalong better than I thought...
Haruna proceeded to tell me\nmore tales of Buchiko...
Haruna and I discussed what\nthe Explorer Club would do...
Haruna took me on a deep dive\ninto Shichi-kun lore...

As their mutual friend,\nI brought the two together...
Tomoko and I carried on\ntalking about different\ncr\xeape fillings...
Tomoko and I had fun\ntalking about our favorite\nsports teams...
Tomoko and I continued\ndiscussing strange drinks...
Tomoko was lost in thought\nfor a while after that...
We continued to hype\nourselves up until Tomoko and\nMiyu ran out of steam...
Chizuko gave me an earful\nof her various\nwitty complaints...
I'm not sure if Chizuko is\nsaying something really\nprofound, or if she's just hammered...
I listened as Chizuko spilled\nher thoughts on how she's\nlived her life...
Feeling sober, Chizuko began\ndrawing up plans for\nthe world...
Shiina regaled me with\nmore stories about her\nflair bartending...
It took a while to clear up\nShiina's misunderstanding...
Afterward, Shiina and I had\na deep discussion about living\non a budget.
Shiina lectured me on\nhow to handle a drunk...

I listened to Seiji go on\nand on about his love\nfor that book...

Tomoko continued explaining\nthe various ways to avoid\nskin damage from UV rays...
Oh, Wonder. Nice to see you.
Oracle was with me just a moment ago, but\nshe left to go check on something.
If you have a message, I can relay it to her\nwhen she comes back.
No matter how many times I come here,\nthis place always feels so strange...
It's not like a cognitive Metaverse, but it\ndoes feel like a collection of minds...
No, overthinking this is pointless. Besides, I\ndoubt I'd find an answer anyway.
At the end of the day, all that matters is\nit's a place where we can relax.
Hey, I saw an adorable stuffed animal over\nthere... Or maybe it was a full-body mascot?
Is that a character from your world? I'd love\nto know more if you don't mind sharing.
It kind of reminds me of Buchimaru-kun\nin a way!
Oh! Good to see ya, Wonder.
I've just been looking around since there's\nso much to see. It's like a little virtual\nworld in here.
Whoa, I've never seen that before! ...Wait,\nno, that's just Inari being Inari...
This space is seriously huge. Oh! Does this\nmean I can fill it with all my favorite stuff?
First up is the Neo-Featherman figure. Then\nmy souped-up PC and instant yakisoba...
And I can't forget my mini fridge either!\nNot to mention a stash of snacks!
Wait a minute... Am I just recreating\nmy room?
Come to think of it, when I passed by\nthere earlier...
Mona and that hooded ghost were having a\nspat, but it was the cutest little argument.
Those two actually get along... but they get\nstrangely mad if you point it out.
Hello there, Wonder!
I was just admiring that display piece over\nthere. Its unique shape caught my attention.
If it's okay with you, I'd love to hear what\nkind of art you like, too.
I know I should stop Mona-chan and Cattle\nfrom bickering, but...
I don't know... I find myself not wanting to\ninterfere because they're just too adorable.
I can't get enough. I just want to see more\nof it.
Do you ever have the same thought?
When I see Queen in battle, I can't help\nbut sometimes think...
Driving around on Johanna looks like so\nmuch fun. I'd love to try it someday.
Oh, right. Maybe I should ask Mona to let\nme drive next time?
Oh, hey there.
This is a curious space. It resembles a\nPalace, but is nowhere near as sinister...
It has this soft, inviting atmosphere that\nmakes you want to visit again and again.
Earlier, I was watching Violet's movements\ntogether with Joker...
Moving that effortlessly might come in\nhandy when fighting in the Metaverse.
Perhaps I should ask her to teach me a\nthing or two.
Care to join me?
Oh, sorry. Did you say something? I was\ndeep in thought.
If you're planning to check on everyone, do\nyou mind if I tag along?
Hello there, Wonder-senpai!
I just got here myself. I umm...
I'm still not very familiar with this place.\nWould you like to look around together?
Right... Point my fingertips more... I need\nto convey bold conviction.
Oh, Wonder-senpai! I was just reviewing my\nrhythmic gymnastics routine.
Since I excel at bold, expressive maneuvers,\nI just wanted to find a way to make my moves\nlook more dynamic.
I know! If it's okay with you, could I ask\nfor your honest opinion?
Just now, I heard the sound of a wind\ninstrument from somewhere.
Was that... a saxophone? Maybe? It sounded\nso smooth yet confident...
It was a lovely sound. I'd love to hear\nagain. After all, music is what puts the\nrhythm in rhythmic gymnastics!
I asked what was going on,\nalthough I already knew it\nwas something petty...
I watched Soy make\nair ramen with Fox...
Hmm... That can be useful, but memorization\nalone can make it difficult to put what you\nlearn to practical use.
She asked if I could help her with some\nmath problems, so I've been teaching her\nformulas and solutions.
If you can't write it down... You could try\nto remember it using mnemonics or examples.
If you try to memorize only the formulas,\nyou'll only end up confusing yourself.
Hehe, the more the merrier. Okay, continuing\non from earlier...
Queen taught Closer and I\nhow to memorize\nmath formulas...
I wonder if I'll still\nremember them when I\nreturn to the real world?
Huh... So, you can enjoy it that way, too.
We tend to think of them being pickled to\nmake umeboshi, but there are actually a\nvariety of ways to serve them.
True. They're just as good in drink form.\nDon't you sell plum juice or anything\nlike that?
Relieving fatigue, huh... Then they might\ncome in handy for our phantom thief\nlifestyle.
I'm quite curious about that plum rice you\ntold me about earlier.
Which would you want to try, Wonder?
That said, all this talk about plums has left\nme with a sour taste in my mouth...
Heh heh heh! If that's what you want...
You can apprentice under me!
I was joking, actually... But if you're going\nto put it that way, how can I refuse?
It'd probably be quicker to learn by doing.\nWonder, do you happen to know of any\nservers we can destroy?
Tch.
Well, let's be serious here. I don't want to\nteach you, the black-haired beauty.
Hacking may be useful in the Metaverse,\nbut it's a crime in reality.
And besides, you have your own strengths.\nYou're fine just the way you are!
Yeah, that's the spirit! That's what I expect\nfrom my apprentice! Heh!
Not really, because it's on the school's\nrooftop. I've got carrots, tomatoes,\nand more.
It's a lot of work to take care of them, but\nI love harvesting big vegetables.
I also recommend adding lots of cabbage.\nMaking it from freshly-picked ingredients\nsounds super fun!
Ratatouille certainly contains a lot of\nvegetables... But isn't it mainly bell\npeppers and onions?
Hehe. All right Closer, my fellow gardener.\nLet me know if you grow anything delicious.
Oh! If we did that, everyone could gather\nhere to cook together. Sounds like a lot\nof fun!
Wow... So phantom thief outfits outfit can\nchange like that.
I really like your usual look, Wind, but this\none is beautiful, too!
If it were me...
Hmm... I think it would be nice to dress up\nlike a character I loved as a child.
But even if it were to change to something\ncompletely different to my current outfit, I\nhave the feeling I'd really embrace it.
I really love that big hood. And the color is\nsuper cute, too!
But I have to say that I really admire the\ntraditional Japanese theme of yours, Wind!
No, I mean... Surely it's more reasonable to\nassume she saw wrong?
Oh hey, Wonder. There's something we should\nmaybe run past you.
We're trying to figure out what it possibly\ncould have been.
At first I thought it was a Shadow, but they\nprobably can't enter this space...
I thought maybe she was mistaken. But if\nthat's what she says she saw...
So, it seems it is not one of Wonder's allies\neither. Simply discussing the matter isn't\ngetting us any closer either...
So, what do you think? Should we investigate?
Come to think of it, I\nwas walking around there with\nLufel on my shoulder earlier.
I should go mention this\nto Violet later...
Wonder-senpai, have you ever tried that\neating challenge at the burger shop?
Ah, but in your world, there's no Big Bang\nBurger, right?
Oh, I see! Even in different worlds, some\nthings are the same.
You say it's similar... So what's different?\nIs it a teriyaki burger or something?
I just know I can beat it!
Hey, that's pretty normal! Regular exercise\nwill take care of it in no time!
Joker-senpai!
Violet appears to have\nquite the appetite...
Cattle looks like an animal of sorts, just\nlike Mona, right?
Nothing really...
But you said that you can't fly in that form,\nso I wondered if you could fly in real life.
So, what do you do in that case? Oh, wait.\nIf my theory is correct...
You maybe do it like this?
I love meat, too! I often have to hold off on\nit before a match, though...
Hey, Cattle, what's your very favorite\nkind of meat?
Grilled frankfurters! You're quite the\ngourmand, aren't you, Cattle!
Oh wow! That sounds like something a phantom\nthief would say! So cool!
So, what else do you eat besides\nfrankfurters?
Oh, it's just... Like Mona-senpai, you said\nyou're not a real owl... right?
However, I'm pretty sure owls are exclusively\ncarnivorous... Is that correct?
I-I suppose so?
I had a very hard time\nclearing things up\nafter that...
It's hard to describe how\nI feel right now...
What is this place...?
What a bizarre phenomenon...
If true, then this place would\nappear to reflect one's own\nperception of reality...
Who told you to leave the door unlocked?
What in the world is going on? And that outfit...
This whole thing is making zero sense!
C'mon, we gotta run!
This place has the best burgers!
Even while eating, you have to be aware\nof your status as an idol.
Wow, you're a fan of Moe-chan too?
Moe-chan is a member of Shibuya's new\nidol group, the Masked Beauties.
You want to join Moe-chan's fan club. right?
If you join now, you can attend\nthe next handshake event for free!
Okay! I'll appoint you as Moe-chan's special\ncheer captain!
I'm counting on you, cheer captain!
Anyway, be sure to come and support Moe-chan\nat the next general election!
If you see anything that interests you, let me know.
...Got it.
Give me a shout when you're ready to order.
...Is this your first visit?
...But you're healthy, aren't you? I can tell\nby your complexion.
We don't take patients without reason. Please\ncome back only if you're feeling unwell.
How may I\u2014Oh, it's you.
Do you wish to hear the results of today's\nreading again?
Meow...\nMeow meow meow...
Oh, it's you... What'll it be today?
You buy it, you look after it.
Oh, hellooo! Please take a seat.
What kind of reading are you looking for today?
Oh, that's a shame... Feel free to come by again\nwhen your curiosity's piqued!
No one bats an eye at animals lurking about\noutside Shibuya Station.
You will never truly grow if you keep\nrelying on others for help.
What a well-maintained instrument. It's\nclear the owner must treasure this guitar.
A charming house.
It has a slight warmth to it.
*cough* Better not to inhale much of this\nsmoke. Let's leave quickly if possible.
I see no problem with having the desire to\nwin big from a small amount of money. But it\nseems like few people are buying them...
Is this the fashionable mode of dress for\nhumans these days? Not that it matters much\nto an owl like me...
Hoohoo! Now here's an establishment\nI can accompany you into!
One duet with yours truly, what do you say?
A bargain... Few other words are so apt\nat stoking human desire.
Ah, visual narrative experiences!\nA fine source of sensory stimulation.
Hoomph... This new film sounds quite\nintriguing. Its title is well designed to\nstoke desire.
Top American box office hit... Was that not\nwritten on the poster of the film we saw the\nother day too?
I'm working on a recording of the song from\nlast time. Want to hear it when it's done?
Really? Thanks...!
Please give it a listen when it's done then!
Okay, later!
See you next time!
Sometime when you're free, let's go to\nInokashira Park!
Oh... You came to see my performance?
Oh no, no, no... Not again!
Aaagh! {NAME1}-san!?
N-No, nothing happened, haha. I definitely\ndidn't lose something again. That'd just\nbe silly!
So yeah, don't mind me...
Oh no... It's gone...
Meow... Meow, meow!
I hear a cat meowing...
Hey there, my friend!
Protein Lovers is open 24 hours a day!\nSign up now for a new member discount!
N-Nope... Haha, i-it's nothing!
When your tummy starts grumbling, nothing hits the spot like yakitori!
How about it? You look like you could go for\nsome grilled chicken!
That's the ticket!
Try a bite of this, for starters!
Okay, see you around.
See you around.
I want the pictures I take to be meaningful.
Will I finally be able to find the "change"\nI've been searching for today...?
There must be a clue somewhere...
The method remains unknown, but I have a\ngeneral idea of the motive...
Sorry, partner! I was just talking to myself.
See you around, partner!
I shall renounce the world and become an\nidle recluse, spending the rest of my days\nwith the flowers and the moon.
A good photograph requires both inspiration\nand the right technique.
Something the matter?
Okay, goodbye.
I guess I'll need to give it some\nmore thought...
Goodbye.
Where in the world...?
Bah, what was the rest of his name...?
Hey, kid, what're you lookin' at?
See ya!
This is quite the venerable old building.\nThis is what they call "retro" these\ndays, correct?
There's nothing we need that way...
There's nothing of interest around here.
So, cigarette smoking is prohibited below the\nage of 20... I suppose you're too young then!
No entry allowed for unaccompanied minors, it seems.
This establishment appears to stay open all\nnight. At least the human desire for alcohol\nseems unabated!
Fusion cuisine... Ah, so they serve meat in\nthe styles of many lands! *shlurp*
Most goods needed for daily life can be found here, it seems.
Sometimes a hand-written message conveys\none's feelings best, don't you think?
Seems like there's someone\nin the back of the store.\nThey must be getting ready...
With you being a high school student,\nwe won't be getting in here.
There's nothing of interest this way.
We should go elsewhere.
This is a shopping district. Where the\npolice can't reach, private security has\nprobably set up shop.
If they have meat dishes, I'd love to join you, however...
I can't simply walk into a restaurant in my\nowl form. Do get some juicy takeout for me.
It would be inappropriate for you to go there.
What a delectable aroma... They must be\nstewing pork. *shlurp*
I've heard the flavor of pork varies between\nshops. I'd love to try it from this\nestablishment sometime.
No entry for minors, it seems.
There seem to be a variety of objects lined\nup here and brought for whatever reason.
The so-called owl feed they sell here looks\nvery unappetizing to me.
I've heard there exists such a thing as "revolving sushi."
But what do they revolve? The fish or the\nrice? Hm? By the look on your face... both,\nbut surely not!?
Acupuncture could be a good way to relieve\nany fatigue from our work in the Metaverse.
I'd like to try it myself, if they're able to\naccommodate owls.
A selection of masterpieces that highlight the artisans' craftsmanship, it seems.
Many humans seem to take particular interest\nin clocks like these. Are you one of them?
"Build your style from the ground up." Ah,\nthey mean you should buy clothes to match\nyour shoes.
I don't see what sets these wares above\nthose available at other shops... except\nthe prices.
The craftsman here might even be able to\ncreate infiltration tools.
"With our umbrellas, you'll look forward\nto the rain!" Hmph, I'll just take shelter\nfrom it in your bag.
ID photos? What on earth could they identify?
There doesn't seem to be anything this way.
I suppose those Tokyo-themed confections\nare for tourists, but they may be\nworth trying!
If you buy a new bag, do be sure it's one\nI'll fit in!
Supposedly the clothes they display most\nprominently are the most trendy.
Take a gander at those high-heeled shoes. It must take strict training to be able to walk in them...
Hoomph, there's something familiar about\nthe music they're playing in here...
Welcome! Let me know if there's anything\nI can help you find.
Welcome! What are you looking for today?
Welcome! We've got a lovely lineup of\nseasonal flowers for you.
Welcome. Let me know if anything catches\nyour eye.
Here's five boilies for catching small-sized fish.
With this weather... rare kinds of fish might\nshow up today.
5 Medium Boilies. Can be used to catch small\nand medium-sized fish.
5 Medium Boilies. Can be used to catch small \nand medium-sized fish.
5 Large Boilies. Can be used to catch large\nand medium-sized fish.
It looks like they're closed for the day.
It seems they're sold out. We'll have to\ncome back another time.
Something seems to be out of order.
You still lack the insight to find your\nopponent's weaknesses. You need practice.
That goalkeeper is more than you can handle\nat present. Better practice more and\ntry again.
I'm not up for doing club stuff today...
Yeah, me neither. Maybe I'll skip.
Wanna go try that new caf\xe9? Remedial classes\nare so boring.
I'm all for checking out a new caf\xe9, but are\nyou sure we won't get in trouble for skipping\nclass?
It's always college this, career that...\nWhatever. I'm not interested in any of it!
Yeah, me neither.
Huh, well then, wanna just go hang out in Shibuya?
I saw Tanemura-senpai in the cafeteria\nduring lunch today! She was looking cool as always!
Wow, lucky! I wish I'd gone with you!
*sigh* Even if it's just for a second, I want\nto lay eyes on Riko-sama every day...
Heeey, did you know?
You can make a regular heptagon with origami!
Isn't it cool!
It's so neat that you can use origami to\nsolve three-dimensional geometry problems!
Need a hand with anything?
Good day.
Can I help you with something?
Welcome! How 'bout some yakitori?
Agh, another whiff...
They wouldn't make any money if you won every time, man...
Yeah, but it sure would be nice to win\nthe top prize and stay in bed the rest\nof my life though...
Wow, she's good!
Is she actually a pro?
I want to hear her other songs. I wonder if\nshe's always playing around here?
Oh my god! She's, like, a songwriting genius!
Sure, she's pretty good, but\u2014
She's gonna be famous soon for sure!\nWe should get her autograph while we can!
Maybe not, I don't want to bother her...
They're just filling enough and have the perfect texture!
That moment of bliss when you bite into\none of these juicy masterpieces is simply\nsublime!
Yeah, they're pretty good, but I still think\ncoming here every day is a bit much...
I heard that the doctor there is\nunlicensed... And that the drugs they\nprescribe are illegal!
Huh, I was told good things about that clinic. Their prescriptions are apparently very effective.
Oh no, I'm sure that can't be true. Everyone knows that doctor's a fraud!
I'm surprised they haven't torn down these\nold apartments yet. Look at the state of 'em.
It doesn't seem like the residents have any complaints, though.
But that building's ancient and it doesn't get any light...
Maybe they like it because the rent is cheap?
You know that caf\xe9 on the corner is always\nfull of girls?
They just opened recently; there was an article about them online.
Yeah, I heard the manager's a big hit.\nThe coffee's supposed to be pretty good,\ntoo, but...
Even mediocre coffee can taste amazing\ndepending on who's serving it...
We just got a new roast in stock. Would you\nlike a sample?
How can I be of service?
This appears to be the most powerful foe\nin this area.
But we'll have to defeat it if we want to proceed... Up for the challenge?
Defeating enough foes within the level\nshould weaken the boss. Let's do that first.
It's for... the kitties.... Um...
Yes! Um...!
I-I'm collecting... donations... to help cats... But um...
Do you wish to read on the couch?
Do you wish to play with that game console?
A tidy room begets a tidy mind.
It's true that a student's duty is to study.
*sigh* Today's no good either...
Hm? U-Uh, can I help you...?
I-I can't really sing today...
Oh, okay...
Mm... Thanks.
Hey, you're here!
I love working at this place! I really\nappreciate you hiring me, boss...
So I mean it when I say I didn't steal\nanything! But... there's no way I can\nprove it.
It's such a shame. I really trusted you, Erika...
You've been good to us until now, so we'll\nlet this go without a police report this\ntime...
Woof! Woof! Hooray! Welcome to Shibuya!\nHave a paw-some time!
Morning, noon, or night,\nShibuya always shines bright!
I'm Shibuya's very own Shichi-kun!\nWanna see me do a trick?
Enjoy your time in Shibuya!
Do you need something?
Yakitori? I didn't order any yakitori.
I think you have the wrong person.
...You've got the wrong person.
Ah, dinner time already...\nCan I help you?
Sorry, I think you've got the wrong guy.\nIt smells good, though. Mmm yakitori...
Good idea. I ought to get that for dinner...
Maybe you'll get my order in next! Who knows!
{NAME1}-kun, how'd it go? Did you get\nthe photo?
Perfect weather for running today!
Man, this station is crazy... I'd definitely\nget lost.
Okay, see you later!
That explains that...
C'mon, let's go!
Oh... Well, maybe next time!
Today... I'm going to try singing again!
Not many patients have been coming in lately...
So what are you here for today?
Oh, good morning. You look tired.
So what can I do for you today?
Good evening. Don't you think you're a bit\nyoung to be out at this time of night?
So what brings you out this late?
Nice weather today.
Well, not my problem...
Then let's head into the examination room.
What are you planning to use that for anyway?
Take care now.
Looks like it's about to rain.
Might not be a bad idea to check the weather\nbefore heading out...
It's pouring out there. You'd better get\nhome quick.
If you catch a cold wandering around in the\nrain, you could spread it to other people.
Hellooo! Please take a seat!
What kind of reading shall we do today?
There's a fortune teller\nover there...
A fortune teller? Shall we ask what the day has in store for us?
Come unwind with a massage\nor one of our acupuncture treatments!
The kennel was broken... And the cats got loose...
Oh, a customer?
Our apologies, but we're fully booked right now.
Welcome, welcome! We've got a special promo\nfor all customers today!
No one's here...
Various items are\nfor sale here...
Monjayaki... I doubt I'd be able to handle\none of those spatulas with these wings...
There's an intimidating guy\nstanding around.
There's a new lineup of\neyedrops on sale...
I hear this caf\xe9's gotten\npretty popular recently...
Argh! I lost my spot in the ranking!
You can get it back, right?
With all my classwork? I don't have the time!
Better try another game then, I guess.
This is a great clinic...
But I guess the bad location keeps business from booming.
The smell of freshly baked\nbread lingers in the air...
It's an old Japanese\nsweets shop.
Burnable garbage is collected\nevery Wednesday and Thursday.
Mom's flowers are growing over\nthe side of the wall...
Zoshigaya is such a nice and quiet place.\nMaybe my husband and I should move here.
The sign says minors aren't\nallowed in...
Plenty of standard drink\nofferings here.
It looks like it's broken...
The second floor is a private\nresidence. I shouldn't go\nup there.
Looks like their specialty is\nomurice with demi-glace sauce.
It says they also\ntreat birds...
Maybe they'd examine an owl?
I don't require a medical examination!
It's the main entrance to\nthe school.
There's a garbage can here.
It says to make sure to sort\nyour trash...
Wanna go for cr\xeapes? I've got a coupon.
I'm dieting right now, so I can't...\nI could go for a smoothie though.
Why not just do both?
The ramen and gyoza set is the best!
No way, you can't have ramen without rice!
It's a fire hydrant.
Arai-senpai's pretty cool!
I know! D'you think she'd let me snap a\nphoto if I asked? I want her on my\nlock screen!
Want me to go ask with you?
It's the bulletin board.\nInfo about school events\nis posted here...
There's boxes stacked on top\nof the shoe locker...
Look at my collection! Isn't it great?
Uh, sure, I guess...
I'm totally gonna date someone older!\nI'd love it if they had a kinda dark,\nmysterious vibe too.
I'd rather date someone around my age.\nI don't wanna be looked down on...
If that's your problem, you'd be better off finding someone younger than you!
Have you seen the new episode yet?
Dude, it was so peak! I didn't think we'd get\nto see that special attack so soon...!
Maybe today I'll find a love letter in my shoe locker!
Not a chance.
Another day where no one spoke to me...
Oh no! I forgot to return the umbrella!
They have a bunch of\ndifferent drinks here.
I'm so glad that we can wear outdoor shoes\ninside at Kokatsu. Having to switch shoes\nall the time is such a hassle...
...What's that, {NAME1}? You prefer having\nseparate indoor and outdoor footwear?\nTalk about discipline... I could never!
What game's that?
Something my dad recommended...\nIt's suuper hard though!
Wow, those are some old-school graphics!
Do I really have to join a club?
The emergency exit is locked.
I should leave them alone.
He's not really an easy guy to get to know, huh?
He's really not that bad. I heard he's pretty\ngood at cooking!
Hey, so I really need an answer from you ASAP.
Sorry, I need some more time to think...
Uh... What're you looking at over there?
S-Shh... They'll find us...! Their sense of\nhearing is 100 times stronger than humans...
Oh... Uh, I see...
Maybe if I stand here, one of the girls will\nnotice me... Or even talk to me!
Nooo, the can's stuck in there...
Rows of thick books...
I wouldn't want to lug\nany of these around.\nThey look really heavy...
Yep, that's a printer.
Have you heard about the school's seven mysteries?
No, and I don't want to either!
Oh, I know the one about the flowerbeds! It's something like...
It's a row of trophies\nand awards.
I can't decide what school I want to go to most...
It's one of the school's\nrest areas...
It's an air conditioning\ncondenser unit.
It's a shop that's popular\neven with tourists.
Oh, just hurry up and pick something!
Hmm, I just don't know what to go with...
It's a row of trophies and\nawards.
Looks like a bunch of\nclub-related awards...
There's a good view of the\noutdoor scenery from here.
I believe a preoccupation with one's personal\nappearance can be called a form of desire.
Feel free to have a look at our products...
I told you I'm not interested!
It's my seat.
It's the blackboard.
I smell grilled meat...
There's a\n"your face here" board...
Would you like to walk home together?
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone...
Let's go get ramen!
Didn't we have ramen yesterday?
He always wants to eat the same thing every day until he gets sick of it.
I don't get much allowance, but I don't want to have to work after school either...
Have you thought about making videos? I hear\nyou can make money even if you just\npost random stuff.
That sounds like even more trouble than a regular part-time job...
S-So, this letter... Could you please...
Wait, what? Are you saying you like m\u2014
Could you please pass it onto someone in your class...?
That girl who was sitting here during lunch was so cute, right!?
Oh, I know her! She's actually...
I heard if you make a wish at the fountain, it'll really come true!
At the fountain?
Why, is there a spirit living in there or something?
Did you see a cat go by here?
Oh my god, there's a cat in the school!?\nI wish I'd seen it!
Hey, why weren't you at the last club meeting?
Sorry, I forgot to ask where it was being held.
There's a sign that warns\nagainst diagonal crossing.
The yakitori stand isn't\nset up today. I should try\nanother day...
It looks like the fortune\nteller isn't here...
That western-style restaurant in Yotsuya\nhas really gone downhill. Awful sauces.
Mm-hm, totally...
And don't even get me started on the Italian\nplace in Shibuya. How did a place like that\neven open up?
Have you tried this new app out yet?\nIt's incredible!
Nah, not really...
Oh, you definitely should then! Here, I'll\ninstall it for you right now!
I dunno if my phone has the space...
I can hear them on a call\nfrom out here...
Even in the era of mandatory personal\nphones, they still need these for\nemergencies, I see.
It might be nice to sit down and observe\ninstead of running around, for a change.
This is a popular meetup spot. I wonder just\nhow many people sit here each day?
The smell of sizzling sauces\nfills the air...
It's the Zoshigaya\nStation platform.
As seasons change, so does the view from the\ntrain station. And the way we look at it too.
I don't even know how to\ndescribe the expression\non my face...
It doesn't seem we can use this elevator.
It's a row of large\nwashing machines.
It seems like you could use this place\nto wash anything too big for your home\nwashing machine.
The lockers could be useful when we have too much to carry.
Let's go to band club practice!
You want to break up? But why!?
I got into that study abroad program, so...\nI thought it'd be better to tell you now\ninstead of later.
Just because you're going away, we can't be\ntogether? Do you not trust me!?
That's not it. I just know I'm bound to end\nup falling for someone who isn't so far away...
Why would you lie to me...?
You mean the thing about every yakisoba bread from the school shop being handmade and having a unique flavor?
Yes! I went and bought ten of them...
Uh, I really didn't think anyone would believe a story like that. Sorry, man!
Is that novel really that good?
Okay, got it.
You're not listening to me at all, are you?
Well, I'm TRYING to read a short story by\nthe great Toshia Soomy, but someone keeps\nchatting to me.
Fine, I'll ask you when you're done...
I-I-I really l-like you...!
Sorry, could you speak up? I can't make out what you're saying.
Whoa, your face is all red. You got a fever?
Argh... Noooo...
Ooh, nice!
Hm? What is it? Let me see!
Whoa! That's...
Shh! If a teacher sees, we're in trouble!
This area is off-limits\nat night...
Friends are so important! You get together\nwith them and have fun now!
Whenever you're in the mood to check out\nthe Companio, just drop by!
Welcome! I hope you're enjoying yourself\nhere!
I'm happy to explain anything you're curious\nabout!
Some things just catch your eye! I understand!
Whatever happens here, you mustn't let it\nget to you now! That's just how it is here!
You can even change the way you look!\nWanna give it a try now?
You forget about your whys and why nots\nand just enjoy yourself now!
If there's somebody you admire that you wish\nyou could change into , just use that machine\nover there!
The Selfie Machine can make that dream\na reality!
It's one of those things that'll make more\nsense if you try it out for yourself!
It's dangerous on the other side of that door now!
It's a lair of strong folks and powerful\nbeasties! Most don't venture that way now.
But it's true you can find the "good stuff"\nin there too! You make your own choices now!
If you do get your hands on some items like\nthat, you bring them back here.
I'll trade you some "good stuff" for them now!
So what next?
P-Please... For the kitties...
It's not budging...
It seems there's another condition for opening this door that we've yet to meet.
What do we do then?
It may not be the right time for this door\nto open. Let's try another time.
That Shadow appears quite powerful... But we'll need to defeat it to proceed.
I think that you lot might just have what\nit takes to overcome any trial...
I heard there was another accident yesterday.
Huh, imagine that.
There was an owl outside the window just now, and it had some paper in its beak!
Seriously? You sure it wasn't a carrier pigeon?
I'm living in the same city as Ikenami-kun,\nso there's a chance we'll meet someday...
...Are you doing what makes you happy?
I feel like every time I want to do\nsomething, I don't feel like doing it\na minute later.
I wonder how Tomoko is doing...\nI hope she's feeling better.
Huh, hang on a sec... Are you into her?
Don't make it weird! After what happened to\nher, any normal person would be curious.
It's so annoying when the train's late...\nHaving to get the late train slip and\neverything is such a hassle.
Yeah, I don't wanna deal with any of that.\nThat's why I leave the house early.
Seriously? Wow, how do you even do that?\nI'm always sleeping in right 'til the last\nsecond.
I stayed up way too late last night. I can barely keep my eyes open...
So sleepy... Just gonna put my head down...
I heard the Subway Slammer turned out to be\na former baseball player!
You know Miyazawa, the food critic? He's on\na bunch of food shows, and he streams too.
He does this over-the-top bit where he\nswings a pen around like a sword.\nIt's pretty funny.
Oh, the Katana Tongue guy? I'm not really into his stuff.
I was a big fan of Kiuchi back when he\nplayed. I never thought he'd turn out\nlike this...
I always see you hanging around with Arai\nthese days. Are you friends or something?
I hear that celebrity critic Miyazawa\naccepts bribes from restaurants to be\nmentioned on his show.
Whoa, that totally sounds like a Menace thing to do.
Ooh, do you think Magatsukami knows about it\nyet? We should post about it!
Oh, good idea! Maybe Magatsukami will comment\non it!
You guys are so weird... Obviously the best\nway to know if a restaurant is good is to try\nthe food yourself.
Don't put so much stock in reviews.
I heard Miyazawa's bringing a contestant onto his stream.
Gotta be a publicity stunt. It's all\nscripted, y'know? He'll just tear the guy\nto shreds in the end.
I dunno... There was something weirdly real\nabout the way Miyazawa talked about it.
Like he was surprised by his own script or something.
It doesn't really matter who wins as long as the show is fun, right?
Hey, you know about that Divine Judgment website, right?
The owner, Magatsukami, really impresses me.\nI wonder where he gets all that info.
Maybe Magatsukami is actually more than one\nperson? I could see the website being run by\na group.
It seems Tomoko Noge has been hospitalized,\nafter being hurt on the subway.
I heard she was actually trying to protect the second-year Motoha Arai at the time of the attack...
And this attack was from the Subway Slammer people have been talking about?
Yeah, that's the one. Apparently, the Subway\nSlammer was actually targeting Arai!
This sounds like it could make a good\narticle. But what to do for the headline...
"Female Student N Injured Guarding Friend A\u2014\nFriend Gets to School Unharmed"?
That makes it sound like the friend\nabandoned her! That's no good.
But it's true, right? Arai did come to school afterward.
Because they only let family come to the hospital with you! Cut the trashy tabloid stuff, man.
Diners are just the right level of noisy for studying.
Except when it gets really busy, then that's too loud...
I hear there's a good model figure shop in\nShibuya, but the manager's kind of scary...
Wanna go together then?
Yes, please! You've really got to see the stuff they have in stock there.
There's been a big uptick in celebrity critics lately.
A lot of the places the new guys recommend\naren't that good, honestly.
I've got an idea! We should make an\ninvestigative article about one of\nthese restaurants.
We can go to places recommended by these\ncritics and verify their claims.
Then we can rank the celebrity critics based\non how dishonest they are!
If the kid who picked a fight with Miyazawa\nis a Kokatsu student, we'd have the scoop!
Ah, I can't wait for that Food Fight video!
C'mon, I just want you to tell me\nNishino-kun's digits!
Why're you asking me anyway? I don't even\nknow them that well...
I heard a rumor you do anything people ask!
Seriously? What kind of a rumor is that?
I mean, if you won't do it, you won't\ndo it... But you will, right?
...Fine, let me hear you out.
That thing about Miyazawa has gone viral, huh.
He was a pretty famous streamer and appeared on TV, so it makes sense.
I just feel bad for those restaurants he got shut down.
Maybe they should sue him. It's Miyazawa's\nfault they were put in such dire straits,\nafter all.
Miyazawa's really ruining things for all the\nreal food critics out there!
Yeah, hearing about him did make me wonder\nif all of 'em take money to lie about food.
All the fall of Miyazawa means...
...is that his seat is open for someone else\nto take. Hah, it'll be a critic bloodbath.
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun... Are you talking\nto me because you want to be friends?
You'd better discard that idea. Friendship\nonly robs us of our freedom.
You want to do research in the library?\nThere was actually something I wanted\nto look into, too...
Ugh, I'm not up for doing club stuff today...
Me neither. It's not like we have any hope of\nwinning the competition anyway...
I wonder how Tomoko's recuperating...\nWe should go visit her!
Some guys she's never met showing up at her\nbedside? That'd probably terrify her, man.
Dude, I'm achin' all over after PE class...
You're just out of shape, man.
Tomoko finally came back to school! Seems like she's doing good!
That's great. You not harassing her at the\nhospital really paid off.
I wish guys would fall all over me IRL like they do in dating sims...
Well then stop playing games and start\nleveling up in real life.
Let's go back to that caf\xe9 after school!
You just wanna flirt with that barista there, don't you?
Huh? How did you know?
You haven't shut up about him since the last time we went.
Let's go get ramen at Victory Kitchen in Shinjuku!
What about that barista from the caf\xe9!?
It's good to diversify your diet every now\nand then!
Uh-huh, sure. So you found a new hot guy at the ramen shop.
Maybe I did, but so what! The ramen's good too!
Fair enough. Let's go.
Are we going for ramen again today?
No. I'm never going there again...
Did something happen?
I have decided to devote body and soul to the Stone Lord...
New game fixation, got it. Guess I'll have\ntime now to work part time after school then.
Kano-kun is kind of hard to approach,\nbut isn't he kind of hot too?
He has a distinctive vibe, for sure.
If I ever find that Slammer, I'll punch his\nlights out! What kind of creep targets girls\nlike that!?
Yeah, what a scumbag. I'll cheer you on!
Wait... You wouldn't help me fight him?
I'd... call the police for you...?
I heard the Subway Slammer got arrested. Serves him right.
I hope he rots in prison. If they let him\nout, he'll just start doing the same\nstuff again!
My favorite Chinese restaurant in Zoshigaya\nhas been closed for ages...
Maybe you could try another place in the meantime?
No, it has to be that restaurant! No other\nChinese food can satisfy me!
Well when you put it like that... It makes me want to try this place too.
Riko-senpai looked like she was having fun\ntalking to Motoha...
I wish she'd talk like that with us...
I'm worried about Riko-senpai... What if she\nwas attacked on the subway and injured?
Don't worry, Riko-senpai could incinerate\nthat Subway Slammer with her majestic aura!
Yesterday, I actually spoke to Riko-senpai!\nI said hello, and she said hello back...
She's so kind and gracious... I should\nwork up the courage to greet her, too,\nif I see her.
Just passing Riko-senpai in the hallway makes\nme feel like my soul's been purified...
Umetane's new product announcements are way\nmore interesting than that Miyazawa\nguy's videos.
Of course they would be; it's Riko-senpai's\nfamily business. Gotta go buy some after\nschool today.
It's the pair that's usually here...
They're whispering\nabout something,\nbut I can't tell what...
I think they're\nlooking this way...
Kano-kun's a good guy. He's really nice.
Wait... R-Really?
Yeah, I asked him for cooking tips and he\nwas really patient explaining everything!
Huh. I didn't expect him to know how to cook.
Arai-san must be really worried about\nNoge-san. I mean, they're such good friends\nand all.
I hope Noge-san's injuries aren't too bad.
It's great to hear they arrested that Subway\nSlammer. He had the girls really scared.
I heard a lot of them were terrified to even\ncome to school. I'm glad they caught him.
There's this place I'd like to go, but I can't really go alone...
Let's go together, then!
Oh, uhh... I don't know if going with another guy would help...
Huh? What kind of place is this?
I've given you plenty of time to think.\nCan you please give me an answer already!
I still need a little more time! Just a little, I swear!
You haven't been coming to press me for an answer recently.
Sorry, I've been busy. Wait... Did you want\nme to pressure you?
No, no, of course not!
There's a ramen place I've been wanting\nto try. Do you want to go with me?
Like... on a date?
No, it's just hard to get in there alone!
Well, that's fine I guess. I'll come along.
Today is the day I'm finally going to get an answer from you!
So you still haven't noticed, huh...
Oh, come on...
What are you doing?
Shh, not so loud!
Did you hear me...? I asked you what are\nyou doing?
I said keep quiet! Or I'll get caught!
By who?
Lemme guess, it's the organization again...?
So what organization is after you today?
I can't say that out loud...
You really need to pick a premise and stick with it.
Are they after you again today?
Obviously!
But don't you need to keep quiet?
So, how's it going?
One of them is hidden in the shadows over there, and another two across the way...
And what organization are they from?
...
You still haven't decided that part, have you?
Why? Why do girls never talk to me?
What kind of poses do girls even like...?
I heard girls like men with an air of ennui\nabout them, so I'm trying to project ennui!
I think this spot is lacking ennui. I should\ntry somewhere else.
I heard that Noge-san is doing several part-time jobs.
Where did you even hear that?
Ah... Lord Ruby is so cool. I wish men like\nhim really existed.
I like Lord Aquamarine!
I got another call from Lord Ruby today!\nI feel so loved...
It's the same with Lord Aquamarine. I get new\nmessages from him every day!
But I might have to give up on him...
Why? You've been so hyper focused on\nAquamarine!
They announced Lord Emerald on social media\nyesterday, and now my heart is his!
That restaurant in Shibuya you recommended was great!
Really? Well, my current recommendation would\nbe that caf\xe9 in Zoshigaya.
Trends change too fast...
Once a place gets enough buzz around it,\nit becomes too crowded. You have to keep up!
Riko-senpai is so cool and kind. She's like a\nlone flower at the top of a mountain...
I know what you mean. She has that unapproachable kind of beauty.
Exactly. But the more she feels beyond my\nlevel, the more I like her...
I feel like I can't pick a place to eat\nwithout checking the reviews first.
People who write that stuff write way too much... Like that Katana Tongue Miyazawa guy.
I get so stressed about missing out on a\ngreat meal or getting a bad one, I\nhave to check.
Wherever we end up at is fine with me.\nIf it's bad, it'll just be a funny story\nlater!
Please go out with me!
Huh!? You can't just say that out of the blue!
Who even are you, anyway!?
I... I sense I've made a grave miscalculation in how to start this conversation!
Oh, you're being targeted again!
Shh! If you know what's happening, then you know you need to keep quiet...
Any new twists in the plot?
Quiet, please...
I'll take that as a no...
Really, nothing?
This isn't fiction! New assassins don't just\npop up whenever you want.
I guess I'll just think of it like following\na manga that's on hiatus then.
Perfect timing. There is something I wish\nto discuss with you.
A curious space has opened up within the\nMetaverse. It's not urgent, but it may well\nbe worth investigating...
Well, do let me know if you change your mind.
This is the place. Let's head in.
We're here!
The couple who lives there are overseas\nright now, you know? But they didn't take\ntheir son with them!
He's in high school, isn't he? Should we be\nworried about him?
He's a good kid, very mature. He always\ngreets me in the morning, unlike my children!
My kids don't have manners like that either...
We've got a club meeting today!\nSee you there!
I'm always hanging out here, unless it's raining!
The soccer team is looking for new players!\nEverybody's welcome, whether you've played\nbefore or not!
If you're interested in joining,\njust let us know!
You need something? I'm pretty busy getting\ninfo on the new Menace right now...
Oh? Are you not familiar with Menaces?
Huh... I'd never have guessed. I thought\neveryone knew by now.
That means I get to show you why they call me\nthe ace of the newspaper club!
Ask me anything about Menaces! I'll tell you\neverything I know.
It's hard to say what exactly makes a Menace\na Menace, but broadly speaking, they're\npeople who trouble others.
Basically, Divine Judgment reports people\ncommitting wrongdoings that aren't\nforbidden by law...
And the culprits are called Menaces.
Hoom? What is it? You need my assistance?
Things have been a little different lately, though.
Since Divine Judgment has gotten popular,\nyou get people who are purposefully trying to\nget on there.
Some people have taken pretty extreme\nmeasures to get labeled a Menace.
Lately, some of them have gone past skirting\nthe law to outright breaking it.
That's why the title Menace applies to a\nfairly wide variety of people now.
You'd think the police would handle this kind\nof thing, but they actually don't!
For one thing, there are just too many\nMenaces reported on Divine Judgment.
For another, their misdeeds span from pranks\nto actual crimes and everything in between.
Just think about how much manpower it would\ntake to fully investigate every one of them...
Yeah, basically.
Very well. Do let me know if you change\nyour mind.
Furthermore, if you investigate one Menace\nincident, it'd be unfair not to do the rest...
So as long as no one gets killed, I don't\nthink the police will get directly involved.
I guess it's a legal thing where the police\ncan't get involved with civil disputes.\nBlegh.
About Menaces? Well, I'd say most people\ndon't like them.
But they have their fans too\u2014or should I\nsay, their followers.
I guess it's kinda like how badboys used to\nbe popular back a few decades ago?
Yeah, that's a normal reaction, I think.
But it's not like the people who hate the\nMenaces do anything to stop them, either.
It's all somebody else's problem until it\naffects you personally, y'know?
People like to yap about it online, but that\njust ends up as free publicity\nfor the Menaces.
And you know what they say about publicity\nit's never really bad. Especially these days.
Sometimes you have to throw up your hands and call the whole world crazy.
If there's anything else you want to know,\njust ask. I'd be happy to share what I can.
Hm? You need something? I'm kinda busy\nchecking the Divine Judgment story\nright now...
Hang on a sec! You... You look like someone\nwho knows a thing or two about Divine\nJudgment.
You don't need to hide it, I can see right\nthrough such feigned ignorance.
Go on then, ask me anything. You'll see what\nmakes me the real newspaper club ace!
In the simplest terms, Divine Judgment is\nMagatsukami's website for reporting Menaces.
It's where people can share any information\nthey have about Menaces who are\ncausing trouble.
Hm... It might be easier to just let you see\nit for yourself.
Look. This is the Divine Judgment homepage.
You can post images, videos, and text.\nThough, as you can see for yourself...
Text-only posts are easy to miss. Image and\nvideo posts are just more attention-grabbing.
Anyone can view it, yes. To post, you have to\nbecome a registered user first.
But registration is quick and doesn't ask\nfor that much info. It's a low barrier\nfor entry.
The number of registered users has already\npassed several hundred thousand and is\nstill rising...
The media has been talking about it a lot\nrecently too. It's kind of a "thing" now\nI guess.
Those are Menaces that have been officially\nrecognized by Magatsukami, the site owner.
They're chosen from among the many Menaces\nthat are posted on Divine Judgment.
Magatsukami produces videos that call\nattention to certified Menaces...
And in some cases, Magatsukami performs\nfollow-up investigations, apparently.
That's a tough one to answer.
Some people think it's decided based on the\nnumber of comments and dislikes from users.
But Magatsukami has never officially confirmed what the selection criteria are.
So we can't rule out the possibility that\nMagatsukami just picks them arbitrarily.
Personally, I think there are upsides and\ndownsides to Divine Judgment.
On one hand, it could prevent future harm by\npublicizing information about Menaces...
On the other hand, it could also be used\nto harass or even dox people over\npetty grievances.
And while Magatsukami does delete posts that\nare clearly connected to personal\ninformation leaks...
The huge number of posts on the site means\nmost posts, i.e. the ones that toe the line,\nget ignored.
I understand your concerns...
But to some extent, these are the same\nproblems all social media sites have.
In that respect, I think it's unreasonable\nto single out Divine Judgment for that.
I should bring a girl with\na sweet tooth here next time.
We should get together when\nthe manager gets back from\ntheir trip.
Futaba gave an innocent smile.
The cat has a kind of curious\nlook on its face...
I can hear some lively chatter\ncoming from inside the store.
I can hear someone\npassionately shouting,\n"Listen to your muscles!"
Sounds like what someone who\nlost something would say...
I'll hold off for now...
I can hear a cat meowing\nsomewhere nearby...
This bathhouse seems like\nit's been around for ages...
It says it's being borrowed.
Something smells good...
As I washed my hands,\nI reflected on life...
This is the girls' restroom...
A bulletin board with posters\npromoting various clubs.
There's a door... It doesn't\nseem like anybody else\ncan see it.
I could cook if I\nhad ingredients...
If I had seeds, I could plant\nthings in the garden...
This spot is nice and quiet.\nA perfect place to\ntake a break...
It looks like I can climb up\nfrom here...
There seems to be a variety\nof equipment set up in\nthe Companio...
I should probably\nhead home soon...
I don't have anything I need\nto do this way... I should\nhurry home.
I should head to school first.
Already fast asleep...
This is a great fishing spot...
I might as well take\nthe opportunity...
I get the feeling he won't\nlet this go until I ask\nhim something...
From this point, several paths lie ahead...
So... tired... Need... to sleep...
But I can't... Gotta stay strong. My favorite\nidol's new album comes out today...
If I can't stay awake, I'm gonna miss out on\nthose super limited-edition bonuses...
But I don't know if my body can take it.\nMaybe a quick rest wouldn't hurt...
So... sleepy...
These are the scratch-off tickets we sell at\nmy store. Every card's a winner, or so\nthey say.
Yesterday a customer came in and bought up\na hundred of them, and apparently ten of\nthem won.
Lucky guy...
But I've actually never tried buying one of\nthese myself.
My wife tells me I should just focus on work\nand earn my pay diligently. But...\nI wonder...
Eh, you're right. I never have any luck.
Hm. Well, it's better than losing.
What does it mean to be in love?
He said he'd come back to meet me, and I\nbelieved him, so we started a long-distance\nrelationship...
But he always says he's busy, so we haven't\nseen each other even once since then.
We still text and talk online, but I still\ncan't help worrying... Should I still\ntrust him?
Hmm... Yeah. You're right. It'll work out...\nBecause we love each other.
Thanks for listening to me.
Another option, huh...
...Thanks. I'll think about this a bit more.
I've been in a long-distance relationship\nwith my girlfriend, but we haven't had a\nchance to meet up at all.
We still text and talk online sometimes,\nbut lately I've just been so busy...
I promised her we'd definitely meet up\nthis time, but I still feel so useless.
At this point, maybe it'd be better to just\nbreak things off...
You're right. I made a promise, after all.\nI've gotta go see her!
Yeah, I can't really ask you to decide this\nfor me.
I'll think it over a bit more. Thanks.
I'm visiting my folks back home in the\ncountryside tomorrow.
My mom's making dinner, and she asked if\nI'd rather have tonkatsu or steak...
How the heck am I supposed to choose!?\nThose both sound amazing!
That perfectly crispy tonkatsu, or a\nmouthwateringly juicy steak...
Aaahh! No way! I can't choose!\nHey, which one do I pick?
Yeah... I was thinking the same thing!\nBut, then again... Aahhh...
Maybe... I should've gone with tonkatsu\nafter all...
They were having a sale on lucky bags, so I\njust bought as many as I could, but maybe I\ngot too many...
You there! Would you be interested in buying\none of these?
Both of them are still sealed, so even I\ndon't know what's in them.
Pick whichever one you like!\nPlease, I insist!
Thanks! You were a huge help!
I see... No problem. I'll just lug both of\nthese back home.
My daughter was just born recently.
She really is such a cute little girl...
I'd do anything to make sure my wife and\ndaughter are happy.
But the results of my last health checkup at\nwork weren't so great...
It's nothing life-threatening, but the\ndoctor said it could get worse if it's\nleft unchecked.
The thing is, the treatment looks like it'll\nbe pretty expensive.
I've been saving up money for my daughter,\nand I really don't want to dip into\nthose savings...
Ah, what am I supposed to do?
I talked about it with my wife. If we work\ntogether, we should be able to make it\nthrough this...
You're right. It's worth putting some more\nthought into this.
Gah, this really is tough... What should\nI do?
You've got a point. We can use our savings\nnow, and I can keep working to save up\nmore for her later.
I've got to take care of my own\nhealth first.
Hee-ho, hey there! Whatcha got there?
That jingle-jangle sound... It's irr-hee-sistable, ho!
I've gotta have 'em! Give 'em hee-here!
I got a little somethin' for ya! Consider it\nmy way of sayin' thanks for always supportin'\nmy business!
Go ahead and choose whichever one you like!
Lookin' forward to seein' you again!
Damn it... This is bad... This is real bad...
I invested everything I had, and it's gone.
This is a nightmare... This can't be real.\nPlease let me wake up!
N-No, if I just... cut my losses...\nI can find a way to earn it all back,\nlittle by little...
Ah, shit... What the hell is my life!?
If I sell now, all my investments will be\nfor nothing... But if I don't sell, I've got\nno cash left...
What... What should I do...?
Nothing but losses... This always happens\nto me.
How long can I put up with this? This is\njust my life...
Hmm... Asset management is pretty important,\ndon't you think?
Of course, I want all my clients to make\na profit.
This product here has a high yield, and I\nwould certainly recommend investing in it.
But, of course... There's no guarantee, so\nit's a high-risk, high-reward situation.
This, on the other hand, is a much safer\noption! It's a guaranteed principal, but not\nas profitable as the other one...
Well, then, which will it be?
Oh, yes, I agree! The guaranteed principal\nis a surefire success. I was thinking the\nexact same!
Oh, yes, I agree! Aggressive investment is\nthe only way to get ahead! I was thinking\nthe exact same!
Oh no! It seemed so promising, but luck\nwasn't on our side...
I... I'm not afraid of anything...
Hyaa!? Wh-What was that noise?
I-I'd better check it out... I c-can't just\nrun away like a coward.
Gotta fight... Gotta fight! But I'm\njust so scared!
We... We actually did it!
Even though it was scary, we pulled through\nsomehow... Maybe that's what it means to\nbe brave.
Thanks so much! Now nobody will ever call\nme a coward again!
Y-You're right. It's much worse to just\nstand here trembling like this!
Even I have courage! The courage to avoid\npointless battles!
Huh? Oh. Right. OoOoOo!
*sigh* No reaction, huh? I guess I'm not\ncut out for this. Playing a ghost in a\nhaunted house and all.
I hope my shift is over soon...
Besides, this place is scary enough without\nme, right? Why do I need to be here?
What do you think? Do you actually want\nme to scare you?
Huh...? But putting in effort sounds like\nsuch a pain...
Eh, at least they're paying me. I guess\nI can play along.
YoOoOoU... totally get it, don't you?
Well then, I guess I'll take your advice.\nTime to make like a ghost and... disappear.\nI'm out of here.
Gotta run, gotta run!
My scheduled delivery time is coming up, but\nthe road's closed for construction!
Gotta deliver this coffee while it's still\nice-cold, or the customer's gonna complain!
Maybe I'd be okay if I bought an insulated\nbag, but I still might not make it in time...
I guess I could take a detour if I hurry...\nOr should I just find a way to keep this cold?
That's right! There's no time to think!
Good point. There's no point in rushing if I\nget a bad review anyway.
My scheduled delivery time is coming up, but\nthe road's iced over... Whoa, almost slipped!
Shoot, I can't keep up my usual speed\nlike this!
Gotta deliver this coffee while it's still\npiping hot, or the customer's gonna complain!
But slipping and getting covered in scalding\nhot coffee would be even worse...
Do I take my chances on those icy roads?\nOr do I take my time and accept the\none-star review...
*sigh* Not much I can do. I guess it's just\nbad luck.
I have in my hand three capsules.
Take the red capsule, and you can see\nreality for what it truly is.
Take the blue pill, and continue believing\nwhatever you want to believe.
And then there's this white pill, which\ndoesn't really have anything to do with this\nwhole situation at all.
So, what'll it be? The choice is yours. Take\nwhichever one you want.
So, you've chosen to face reality...\nWell then, I'm certain we'll meet again.
Choosing to stay in Wonderland... I see.\nFarewell.
You actually chose that one... Hm. Well,\nthat's probably okay, I guess.
Hey, mister. Wanna play with me?
I've got tons of trading cards and toys.\nThey're all super popular, y'know.
But my friends at school are all into some\nother stuff... Nobody ever wants to play\nthe games I like.
It's no fun playing by myself all the time...\nIf I give you one, will you play with me?\nC'mon, please?
Oh, my mom's calling for me, so I've\ngotta go. See you later!
Oh. You surprised me. I thought you were\nsomeone I know.
Well, whatever. Anyways, I heard there's\na really nice pachinko machine here,\nso I came to check it out.
Sounds pretty hot. My buddy told me he made\nover ten thousand yen in one go.
Sweet deal, right? When I heard that,\nI brought along all my cash to try it out\nfor myself.
It's an investment, right? You'll get more\nback if you put more money in.
Oh. It's you. Good to see ya again.
I'm headed to the game center today!
So, get this... There's supposed to be some\npretty valuable prizes right now. And I know\nwhich machines are easy to win. Heheh.
Sure, there's a tiny bit of luck involved...\nBut if you just keep trying, you're\nguaranteed to win.
Thing is, I didn't have any money, but I\nmanaged to sell some of my mom's jewelry\nat the pawn shop...
But I'm gonna win back way more than what\nI sold it for. It was an investment, right?
God dammit...
Oh, it's you again. My old friend.
Well, you see... My parents kicked me out of\nthe house... Those idiots...
But I was smart! I talked them into giving\nme a ten thousand yen bill before I left.
Now, let's see... Do I take this to the boat\nraces, or the bike races?
It's an investment! This ten thousand yen is\ngonna be the start of my new life.
All I've gotta do is hit it big. You get it,\nright?
Is this really all my life turned out to be?
It's not like I hate my job or anything,\nit's just that...
Aren't there places where I could make\nbetter use of my talents?
Maybe I should just quit my job and start\nfresh! But then again, if it doesn't\nwork out...
Shoot! I need to make a decision, but I've\ngot no idea what to do!
That's it! You only live once, right? I've\ngotta take my chances!
But will any company even hire me?\nWhat am I supposed to do with my life...
You've got a point... Guess my current job\nisn't so bad, is it?
That feeling of leaving everything up to\nchance, letting the whims of fate take hold\nof your life...
It's irresistably thrilling! Heh heh...
Don't you think so?
Can you lay everything down, and let\nfate decide?
It's easy... You've just got to let go.\nThink you can handle it?
Young man, will you take up my blade in\nmy stead?
Ahaha. Sorry for springing this on you all\nof a sudden.
I'm a cosplayer, and this is a replica of a\nsword from a video game...
As I was making it, I started to think it\nmight not suit me.
But after taking all that time to craft it,\nit seems like a waste to just throw it away.\nSo... do you want to take it?
R-Really? Haha, thanks... I am pretty\nproud of it.
Take good care of it, okay?
It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
...Sorry! Just a joke.
I make video game cosplay. I got an order\nto make a replica of that famous shield from\nthat one game...
But the orders got mixed up, and this is a\ntotally different character's shield!
So, if you want, you could take it...
Seriously? Well, if you're interested...\nThanks!
Here you go. Take care of it, all right?
My grandson is always playing video games.\nHe even told me I look like one of\nthe characters.
He even said I should dress up as them.\nThat "cosplay" thing people are into.
But this character is a warrior who carries\na sword and shield...
Where do folks even get that sort of thing?\nYoung man, do you know anything about this?
Oh! That's just wonderful! My grandson is\ngoing to be delighted when he sees this.
Thank you, young man! Take this as thanks.\nIt was such a generous gift, after all!
Oh! That's very impressive. That'll probably\nbe enough on its own.
Thank you. Here's a little something for\nyour trouble.
I see... That's a shame.
A famous author once said that horse racing\nis a reflection of life itself...
Me, I'd say the opposite. Life is just a\nreflection of horse racing!
That horse I've had my eye on, she's\ndefinitely going to win today.
I just know she's a winner... That's why\nI keep betting on her!
My hopes and dreams are all riding on\nthat horse!
Ahh... She'll definitely win today.\nShe just has to!
Oof... No luck today either. It's always\nlike this... Horse racing is a reflection of\nmy life, after all.
It's... a bit embarassing hearing that from\na kid your age...
Damn it, don't give me any of that shit...
My goddamn boss is always pushing more work\non me and making me screw up.
He's always like, "sorry, can you take care\nof this?" And then I end up working overtime\nevery single goddamn day!
I've had enough! This time I'm quitting!\nI'm not playing games anymore! This\ngoddamn job...!
I'm just sick of covering up other people's\nmistakes...
I can't do this, I just can't...
I went to that popular fortune teller the\nother day, and she said I had to "change my\nlife completely".
Apparently if I don't make at least one\nmajor change, my luck is going to\ntake a turn for the worse...
But what is there that I can even change?
Right! That should help me feel more at ease.
But... there's no way that'll be enough.\nIs that really okay...?
Ah, what to do...
The person you see before you... is not\nthe real me...
The real me isn't just some\npathetic loser...
This is all just a dream.\nA horrible dream...
I'm sleeping in my penthouse apartment, and\nwhen I wake up, my beautiful wife and\nchildren will be there...
Don't tell me I'm avoiding reality!\nThis isn't... The real me is...!
I'm not lying! Shut the hell up! I'd never\nlie to anyone, especially not myself! I...\nI...!
Today's youth have forgotten what it means\nto pray...
Through faith and prayer alone, we can save\nthis world from impending disaster...
Why, oh why, have people turned away\nfrom prayer?
Is this simply the inevitable march of time?
You there, young man... Won't you join me\nin prayer?
Thank you... Young man.
O Lord... Is this a sign? Are you telling me\nit is better not to pray?
Gyaaah! Th-The data from our last\nexperiment... It's gone!?
Wh-What am I supposed to do? The conference\nis coming up soon!
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this green record on the human heart...
I need to get my results ready quickly!\nB-But do I even have enough time left?
If I can't find someone willing to\nparticipate in the experiment soon, I...
You there! Would you help out with this\nexperiment? Or you could at least refer a friend!
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this red record on the human heart...
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this blue record on the human heart...
I'm researching the effects of the music\non this pink record on the human heart...
Thanks! You're a lifesaver.
You're really helping me out... Seriously,\nthank you so much.
Well, then, if it's not too much trouble,\nplease take this!
I was just out thrifting, and everything was\nso cheap that I got carried away, but I\ndon't really need this...
Hey, you there! Want to make a trade?
There two things... Well, I wouldn't call\nthem junk, but I just don't have a use\nfor them.
You can even just take one if you want.\nPlease!
Ah, much appreciated!
Ugh... It's fine. I'll just take these both\nhome with me...
Oh, you there! Do you have anything you\ndon't need anymore?
I've just opened a secondhand shop, but\nwe're still a bit short on goods.
If there's anything you're willing to part\nwith, I'll gladly take it off your hands.
Of course, I'm not asking for it for free!\nThis is business. Want to make a deal?
Great! Thanks!
Okay, then... No problem.
Hey there, friend. Good to see you again.
That ten thousand yen from my parents was\ngone before I knew it. I've started working\npart-time now...
I think this experience has truly changed me.\nI never realized how hard people work every\nday just to save up a bit of money...
I've gotta get out. I'm gonna buy a\nlottery ticket!
This one's a home-run! That money is gonna\nturn everything around for me!
Everyone's gotta win something at least once\nin their life. Right? Right...?
Howdy there, sugar!
Lately, I've been studyin' up on some new\nbusiness strategies!
One idea is to hand out Marthym-themed\nshopping bags to all of my dear customers!
From what I hear, it's somethin' folks\ncall "branding."
Another plan is to create point cards for the\nshop. Which idea do you think takes the win?
All righty, that's settled. Thanks a\nbunch, sugar!
Alright. Time to start the second phase\nof the experiment...
But there's not much time until the deadline\nfor my report... I might just have time for\na single test.
Right! Just one test should give us enough\ndata for our hypothesis.
...Oh, hey. Feel like helping with\nan experiment?
I'd like you to choose one of these records\nto listen to. Any one of them is fine!
Hey, do you know anywhere I could grow\nplants? Somewhere with a lot of space so\nthey can grow really, really big!
Uh, it's for homework. My teacher told us we\nhad to record the growth of plants.
Check it out. I got these seeds! But I don't\nreally know where to plant them...
Any idea where I could plant this?
Really!? Then can you plant it for me? I'll\ncome see how it's doing later!
Oh, really? Then I guess I'll go look!
Thanks, dude! Here, you can take this!
Oh, it's you! Did you bring the flower pot?
Whoa, it already got this big? I bet it'll be\na whole tree soon!
I heard if you want it to grow really big,\nyou have to give it lots and lots of water!
So should I water it some more?
Oh, I get it! Then I'll just wait and see.
Thanks so much, dude! See ya!
Huh? I think we gave it a bit too much...\nI don't think it'll grow any bigger now.
But thanks for all your help anyways!
Here, you can have this!
You know, I've been mullin' over some ideas\nfor a new service...
And here ya have it! It's an\nexchange voucher!
Just bring this here voucher in, and you'll\nbe able to trade it for some reeeal\ngood stuff at my shop!
Oh, and since you've been such a\nfantabulous customer...
This one's on the house!
Lookin' forward to seein' you again,\nsweetie pie!
Aww, that's too bad... Well, you can take\nthis anyway, okay?
Hey, it's you again! Thanks for playing\nwith me before!
Lately, my friends at school have started\nplaying with me.
They said it looked like a lot of fun when\nI was playing with you, so they wanted to\ntry it too!
But they're not very good yet, so it's still\nway more fun to play against you.
So here. You can take this. It's one of my\nmost treasured cards!
Or, if you want, I've got a card case you\ncould take too... Which one do you like more?
What should I do? I've just got no clue...
Oh! You over there!
Could I have a minute? I need some advice!
You see, I actually offered to help with this\nevent at my little brother's kindergaren...
But it turned out to be some kind of\nsuperhero show! I don't know a single thing\nabout this stuff!
A hero's weapon is usually a sword, right?\nOr would a gun be better?
Looks like something is\nunder the bench...
It might be worth\nchecking out...
He's staring at my Railway\nCoins... Maybe that's what\nhe wants?
Should I give him some\nRailway Coins?
He doesn't look satisfied.\nMaybe a few more...
He skipped away, looking\ncompletely pleased...
What did Diogenes think we should do to free\nourselves from desire?
So you were listening... Tch.
Howdy, I'm Mr. Nagara, your literature\nteacher!
Spring sure is in the air! I can feel your\nyouthful exuberance from here!
I sure do hope this old geezer can keep up\nwith you youngsters!
Wait, what am I saying!? I'm still in the\nspringtime of my life too!
Thank you for indulging me in a few playful\nword choices.
Now then. I must stress that it's imperative\nto respect that which is not yours, even in\nliterature.
In fact, there is a famous work that starts\nwith that very idea. Yes, I'm talking about\nthe norm-breaking "The Tosa Diary"!
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun, correct? Here's an\neasy question for you!
Was the author of "The Tosa Diary" a man or\na woman?
Well done! That's right!
Indeed, it was penned by none other than\nKi no Tsurayuki.
Ah... Maybe you overthought that one?
The answer is a man. The author's name was\nKi no Tsurayuki.
It was actually written by a male author.
It's Japan's oldest example of diary\nliterature, and it shows respect to the\nopposite sex.
Respecting those different from you. That's\na skill I want to learn. Like...
"It is generally a youth who imbibes what is\ncalled bubble tea. But now an old man will\nsee what he can do."
"The Stayin' Fresh Diary" by Nagara no\nTsurayuki. What do you think? Just kidding!
What do I even say to that?
Just watching this man is an ordeal.
Howdy! Today, we're covering "The Tales of\nIse." Specifically one man's journey long,\nlong ago to the east!
Basically, he left Kyoto because he saw\nhimself as an "eunakimono." In Old English,\nthat'd be something like "cumber-world."
Any idea what that word would mean in\nmore modern terms? How about...\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
Ding ding ding! Yep, it's about him going on\na trip eastward after feeling useless and\nheartbroken.
Very creative, but nope! The answer is\nsomeone worthless, useless, or like a waste\nof space.
"Azumakudari," or literally "going down to\nthe East," is about a dejected man traveling\nto relieve his heartbreak.
By the way, the protagonist is modeled after\nAriwara no Narihira, the biggest playboy\nof the time.
Of course, it's not like women back then had\nmuch say at all when it came to romance.
Even freedom of marriage is a new thing on a\nglobal level, but that's just how it was back then.
In fact, there's one about a princess who\nrefuses an arranged marriage and becomes\na pirate!
The famed pirate Awilda! I just love that\none! She was a fifth-century Scandinavian\nprincess.
It's up in the air if she really existed or\nnot, but I love that her story of choosing\nher own path is still being told.
After all, isn't it proof that we've always\nvalued and chased after freedom?
Whoops! Sorry, gotta get back to Narihira.\nI'm being a real "eunaki" teacher here!
A legend acting as proof of desire through\nits existence? An interesting view to be\nsure, but...
Can't he calm down a bit? His enthusiasm is\nputting a damper on my mood.
This story begins with the famous line,\n"Long ago, there was a man..."
And that was the story of the Tale of Heike.\nIt seems that war never ends in any era...\nHow sad...
But let's put aside such dark tales for now.\nLet us turn our discussion toward recent\nevents in countries abroad!
Theives are in all places and times periods,\nbut accounts of "chivalrous thieves" stealing\nfor the good of the people also exist.
There are various rumors about these\nchivalrous thieves, such as they don't target\nthe poor and give away what they steal.
My favorite has to be Ghino di Tacco, the\nItalian chivalrous thief from\nthe 13th century!
He stole from the rich, but never the poor.\nThere's even an anecdote about him providing\ncare to the sick and injured for free.
His conduct earned him the support of the\npeople, and he was even given a nickname...
Does anyone know what it might be? I'll give\nyou a hint... It perfectly describes yours truly!
Our eyes have met, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nWhat was Ghino di Tacco's nickname?
Correct! Yes, it was "gentleman." Did\nmy hint make it too easy? Just kidding!
J-just what kind of image do you have of\nme!? The correct answer is "gentleman."\nSee, just like me!
To steal the heart's of the people and be\ncalled a gentleman thief... He must have been\ntruly something to earn the such praise.
He was originally born into a noble family,\nso I suppose he had his own virtues that he\nwouldn't give up on...
A bandit who helps the weak and the poor...\nA true gentleman thief! Isn't he just\nthe coolest!?
Shouldn't teachers aim to be gentlemen who\nare adored by their students like that?\nJust kidding!
I feel as though I'm still a bit lacking in\ncomposure to be called a gentleman now...
But it's good to have the desire to be\ncharming. Never back down and give it\nyour all too, okay?
Howdy! Today we'll be starting "The Tale of\nGenji," a true Japanese literature classic.
I'll do my darnedest to make sure you all get\nwhy it's so amazing! And I'll try to not go\noverboard with my enthusiasm, hahaha.
But I will say the way Kiritsubo is described\nin the textbook doesn't get me very hype,\nif I'm honest...
Speaking of which, Hikaru Genji's romantic\nescapades are so well known and interesting!
Maybe I should start with a quiz on the\nsecret to his charm?
So then... {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
What did women of the time find so\nattractive about Hikaru Genji, the ultimate\nplayboy?
Ah, did you say that because "hikaru" means\n"to shine"?
Sorry, the real answer was his wealth.
Ah, I see you're a careful reader.\nThat's right! It was his wealth.
After all, he had enough money to have a\nmansion built so he could live there with all\nhis romantic conquests.
While the idea of a shared house between\nlovers may seem pretty wild, it wasn't so\nbad for the time.
There were barely any jobs for women then,\nso they would have needed a man to help\nthem find a place to live...
Hikaru Genji wasn't someone who just threw\nhis past lovers to the curb. He gave them not\njust a home, but a certain lifestyle.
He probably looked like a reliable guy to\nwomen at the time!
That's my theory, at least.
Guess it wasn't just his good looks that\nshined, but the coins in his purse too...\nJust kidding!
Hoom... Problematic by today's moral\nstandards, but his sense of loyalty toward\nhis companions is commendable.
Perhaps we ought to learn from his example.
Howdy, everyone! Today we'll be covering\n"The Pillow Book."
Sei Shounagon... Talk about beauty and brains!\nOr at least I think so!
They often call her Lady Murasaki's rival.
But it's very likely that they'd never met.
Their times at the imperial court were off by\nfour years. That's like you all being rivals\nwith a bunch of middle schoolers!
But, despite their limited relationship,\nthey did collaborate...
In the "Hyakunin Isshu"! Yes, the poetry\ncollection found now on karuta cards!
In it, Lady Murasaki... On second thought,\nI'll ask one of you.
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun, I saw you first,\nso you answer this one.
A "kimariji" in karuta is the number of\nrecited syllables you need to identify\na card.
So what's the fewest number of syllables\nthat a kimariji can have in this game?\nGive me your best shot!
Whoa! Ding ding ding! Unbelievable!\nImight've underestimated you,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
Ah... Maybe that was a bit of a toughie. The\ncorrect answer is one!
There are seven cards with a kimariji of one.\nLady Murasaki's poem is among them.
They're remembered by their\nfirst syllables...
Just rememmber "mu, su, me, fu, sa, ho,\nand se." That's the trick!
It's not like this will come up on your\nexams, but it could help you win your next\ngame of karuta!
I must seem pretty scholarly now, huh?\nHahaha! Don't let this make me your\nfavorite teacher, though, okay?
Hoom... Putting aside any favoritism, such\ntricks could also be useful for our\nMetaverse battles.
Brute force is important, but not as much\nas the Knowledge required to figure out\nhow to steal something.
Howdy! Everyone memorize the opening of\n"The Tale of the Heike"?
I feel like it's pretty easy since it just\nrolls off the tongue so wonderfully!
"The color of the sala flowers reveals the\ntruth that the prosperous must decline."\nHeavens to Betsy, that's good prose!
None symbolize that decline better than\nTaira no Kiyomori, who died of fever.
The way it's depicted in "The Tale of the\nHeike" is just incredible...
Right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!?
When Kiyomori is delirious with a fever,\nguess what happens to the water that's\npoured on him?
Hmm... Did you not hear the hint I gave you?\nHe had a fever! So it began to boil!
Ding ding ding! That's right! The water\nboiled the moment it touched him!
That's just how feverish his body was. The\nwords put such a vivid and easy-to-understand\nimage in your head, right?
You get hit with this cool description that\ntells you what kind of story you're in for.\nThe same goes for the opening.
"The proud do not endure, they are like\na dream on a spring night..."
You can just tell that the mighty Taira clan\nis going to fall!
With just this tiny bit of gorgeous writing,\nyou can guess what kind of exciting tale is\nabout to be woven.
Hoom. It sounds like everything we hope for.
May those with hearts full of twisted desires\nbe like a dream on a spring night...
As loathsome as I am to empathize with that\nteacher, the words are indeed voguish.
Okay, that was "The Life of an\nAmorous Man."
I love how passionately you students devour\nit from cover to cover every year!
I mean, the title says it all. I'm in love\nwith it too! Head over heels! Whoops,\nsorry, that was a little overboard...
Ihara Saikaku's ukiyo-zoshi is often talked\nabout. He wrote tons of haiku, famous for\ntheir five-seven-five syllable structure.
They were so popular in Edo, he even tried\nto see how many he could write in a day.
And you won't believe the kind of record\nthat Saikaku set with this challenge!
Okay, time for a challenge from me, too!\nI'm feeling like {PLAYER_NAME}-kun\nhas this one in the bag!
How many haiku did Ihara Saikaku make\nin a day? Remember, he was a legend!
Think bigger! That's mediocre at best.\nThe answer is a jaw-dropping 23,500 haikus!
Yes, I knew you'd pick up what I'm putting\ndown! Unbelievably, it's over 20,000.\n23,500 haikus to be precise!
That comes out to about 16 poems a minute.\nIsn't that crazy? I'm flabbergasted myself!
My fingers are cramping just thinking about\nit, let alone having to write them all!
Not to mention, they didn't even have\ncomputers back then! I could never!
All this is to say that Saikaku was a speedy\nauthor and a best-seller too. It's no wonder\nhe's always been a star.
I love authors who always put out new work.\nThe wait is truly the worst part of a sequel,\ndon't you agree...?
He seemed to get pointedly more enthusiastic\nthan usual... But now it looks like he's put\nhimself in quite a funk...
Do these "sequels" affect him that much?\nHoohoo... Maybe you should try writing one\nyourself then.
What say you I should do after you abandon me and ascend!?
That little excerpt was from "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter" and is personally my favorite scene.
A luminous being then places a robe on\nPrincess Kaguya making her feel indifferent\nto her earthly connections.
All her feelings for the ones who raised her for 20 years, gone like that.
Luminous being, what color do you bleed!?
That's how the catchphrase goes. But blood\nisn't always red, you know.
Octopus blood is well known to be blue,\nand... Maybe {PLAYER_NAME}-kun\nwill know this one.
Blood can be another color aside from red\nand blue. Tell me, what do you think it is!
Nope, sorry! The right answer was green!
Ding ding ding! Absolutely correct!\nThe right answer was green!
The animal that bleeds that color blood\nis even called the green-blooded skink!\nHard to forget once you hear the name.
What caused it again? Broken-down hemoglobin\nnot getting converted or something?
Well, that's something to ask your science\nteacher! Okay, back to class!
What's wrong with having different color\nblood? That reminds me... I heard emotionless\npeople are described as "cold blooded."
The idea that the color or temperature of\none's blood could affect one's nature is\nprofoundly fascinating.
Howdy! Today we'll be covering Yoshida\nKenko's "Essays in Idleness"! I just love\nthese kinds of works.
People often think that literature is\nimpossible to understand, but Kenko's\nwords are still applicable even today!
The passage "It is enough, it would seem, to\nhave been born into this world for a man to\ndesire many things" is so true, y'know?
"It is desirable that a man's face and figure\nbe of excelling beauty."
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!\nI bet your chic little self will know this.
By "face and figure of excelling beauty,"\nwhat is Kenko saying is desirable?
No, no! You're overthinking it! The answer\nis studly looks\u2014something I'm after too!
Ding ding ding! Yeah, who wouldn't want that?\nI totally do!
Kenko then writes about other qualities of an\nexcellent man like the ability to listen well\nand hold an enjoyable conversation...
...a familiarity with scholarship and poetry,\nand to respectfully reject but not abstain\nfrom a few drinks or fun.
I know I'm pretty great, but I'm not that perfect!
Just kidding!
...Putting aside that man's rambling,\nit seems that perfection has always\nbeen desired.
And that even in this Kenko figure's time,\nsuch desires grow stronger the further away\none is from them.
Okay, class. Today we'll go over the author\nof "Mido Kampakuki."
His name was Fujiwara no Michinaga. There's a fun story of him realizing he's cursed!
Really. Curses! They just loved that stuff\nback in the Heian period. It was just\nghosts this, spirits that!
With everyone feeling so insecure from rampant fears that Buddhism would end...
I kind of get why they'd wanna curse each other.
But people got cursed for a lot longer\nthan you might expect.
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun! Pop quiz time!
Who's the historical figure you wouldn't\nexpect had a curse put on them!\nHint: A big, black ship!
Ding ding ding! That's correct! The man who\ndemanded that Japan open up!
Y-Y-You sure do say some scary stuff!\nNo bad blood between anyone here!\nI won't be cursed!
The answer is Perry-san! The guy who demanded\nthat Japan open up!
Well, it wasn't just him, but I guess all\nforeign nations. Sounds like they just\nwanted all of 'em away!
I get it, though. Don't we still turn to\nthe divine for help as a last resort?
Divine ones! My wife isn't looking me\nin the eye lately! Please, you gotta help me!
...Just kidding! That was just a joke!\nThings with my family are smooth sailing!
At least this time around, his claim to be\njoking around sounds much sadder than\nhis others...
His attitude would probably improve if he changed his outlook on things...
But he'd even be a handful for those divine beings he mentioned earlier...
First time taking my class? Or... not? Well, either way...
I'm Ms. Katayama, and I teach math and homeroom.
While I don't mind answering questions\noutside of class, don't think that means\nyou can hang around for too long, okay?
If you stay back too late, your parents will start to worry.
I don't want them thinking I'm some kind of bad influence on you all.
You know, that reminds me of something...\nHow about a little warm-up question to\nget the gears turning?
Okay, since I saw you first, try answering\nthis, {PLAYER_NAME}.
We can describe a person whose actions\nnegatively impact others as a certain rotting\nfruit. Which fruit do you think that is?
Though scientifically speaking, it could be any kind of fruit.
Hm? Yes, well done. The answer is apple.
As the old saying goes...
One bad apple spoils the whole barrel.
And by extension...
...we use "bad apple" to refer to a person in\na group who causes problems for the others.
The phrase always reminds me of my least\nfavorite kind of apples: granny smiths.
And now I can't help but see delinquents as\nsweet little old ladies. Their tough guy acts\njust lose all meaning. Funny, isn't it?
Hmm... I guess not. You don't run into many\nbad apples these days, I suppose.
Anyway, enough chit-chat. Let's move on\nfrom apples and get into some math.
Seeing hooligans as beldames? Fascinating.\nWitnessing such a sight does sound\nentertaining to say the least.
So, would that make you an elderly woman\nas well? Or perhaps some other sort of\nold bat. Hoohoohoo.
Guess what? A friend recommended me\na biopic on a man named Rob Roy. His display\nof altruism was truly amazing.
He buys cattle to help starving people, only\nfor an evil aristocrat to swindle him, kill\nhis friend and kidnap his wife.
But then the outlaw turns it all around!
Oh, seeing him stand defiantly against that\nwigged jerk really had my heart racing!
...I see you kids find older movies boring.\nSorry if I got a bit too carried away.
Oh, I know. Seeing as we're talking about\nRob Roy... how about a math question\ninvolving cattle?
It's known as Archimedes's cattle problem.
It's all about how many cows you need.
Try answering this, {NAME1}-kun. Just think\nof it as a fun little brainteaser.
Archimedes's cattle problem was posed\naround 250 BC. How many years did it take\nto get solved?
Nope, even more. It took over 2,000 years.
It was finally solved in 1965.
Ah, that's right! It took over 2,000 years.
But I guess it is a bit unclear when exactly\nit was posed by Archimedes, so it's not like\nit was this ever-unsolvable problem.
Still, a problem that escaped being answered\nfor that long... Doesn't it remind you of\nchasing some impossible dream?
Time just kept passing and passing, and yet,\nthere were always people toiling to find\nthe solution.
Kind of like how Rob Roy lived.
Maybe I'll rewatch that movie when I get home.
That feeling of striving to obtain the solution you desire...
Hoohoo... Ms. Katayama gets it.
Let's see here... We were covering\nthe sine formula last time, weren't we?
Right, then we'll go over how to apply it today.
It's actually pretty easy, so we can just\njump right into it. First, we circumcircle\nan arbitrary triangle...
Actually, that reminds me... A student\nin another class asked what makes\nan arbitrary triangle arbitrary.
It'd be good to check if you all understand\nthat before we're too deep in the lesson.
I'll just pick one of you at random...\n{NAME1}-kun.
What's an example of an arbitrary triangle?\nGive it your best shot.
Ooh, sorry. The right answer is any kind\nof triangle.
Great job. That's right, it's any kind\nof triangle.
More specifically, it's just a way to say\nevery possible triangle is on the table.
The term "arbitrary triangle" is used when\nthe problem can be solved using\nany triangle.
Colloquially, it means you can pick whatever\nkind you want.
Some questions only work with a right triangle, right?
We say arbitrary triangle when we want to avoid all that mess.
It seemed pretty intuitive to me, but I guess\nit's math jargon.
Ah... One word being understood in different\nways between two parties. A common issue.
Though it seems obvious...
...many often forget that we must never\nassume our understanding to be the same\nas another's.
Ugh... I can't stand it. I hear it time and\ntime again all year round as a teacher.
"I'm not gonna use this math outside\nof school."
And sure, you may only need arithmetic\nin daily life to figure out discounts\nand stuff...
But we have math to thank for even the most\nmundane little parts of our lives, you know!
Clocks, calendars, maps... All of it is thanks to math.
Math even has ties in historical events.
Hey, {NAME1}. Tell me, what was a time when math\naffected history?
That's right! The ending of a war. Don't get\nme wrong, though, someone didn't stop a war\njust with math.
I mean... How could one individual ever do\nthat? But yes, the answer is ending of a war.
I'm talking about decrypting German codes\nduring the Second World War. Mathematicians\nplayed a huge role in that, you know.
Marian Rejewski laid the groundwork for it,\nand Alan Turing completed it, basically.
It's said they shortened the war by\nthree years and saved countless lives\nwith their work.
Turing is also the father of modern computer\nscience. You can thank him for your\nsmartphones!
See? Math does help you in life. Though it\ndoesn't need to be useful to be beautiful.
Honestly, I really wish people would think\ntwice before they say that math is useless\nor pointless.
If she doesn't want people talking about\nhow it is or isn't useful, why does she bring\nit up?
Humans can be such irrational and incoherent\ncreatures. Though I suppose desire behaves in\nmuch the same way.
Let's continue from where we left off last class and jump into probability distributions.
These are numbers that describe a distribution.
Let's start with a random variable's\nexpected value, the average after\nweighted probability.
You learned about averages in middle school,\nright? They'll often pop up in online survey\nresults.
Average summer bonuses, average savings of 30-somethings...
...average age to find a partner... That kind of thing.
But things can get confusing when you look\nat the data. So why don't we review how to\ndo that?
How about... {NAME1}-kun today. Take a look\nat this chart.
What's the best representative value\nto use in order to express this sort\nof data distribution?
Ooh, unfortunately not. It's best to use\nthe median here.
Yes! The mean would be easily affected by\nthe extreme outliers...
...so it's best to use the median here.
Being below average might make you despair...
..but who knows, maybe you're way above median!
That's why you should always make time to\nensure your data is being analyzed properly.
We all worry about how others see us...
That's why you should try to look at things in the best way!
But let's go back to probability\ndistributions. Okay, everyone look at\npractice question one...
I'll never understand those who worry\nabout being less or more average.\nJust worry about yourself, I say...
How do you see your desires, {NAME2}?
So, one of the students in another class\nwon a local research prize.
I've been roped into helping them prepare\na few things...
...but I was so pleased to see their hard\nwork being rewarded, I cried as if it was\nmy own award!
So I hope you all invest yourselves in math\njust as much as they did. Enough to win\na Nobel Prize!
Heheh, only kidding... Oh, but this might\nmake for a good question for the class.
This isn't so much math-related as it is\ntrivia, but I'll ask anyway. Try answering\nthis, {NAME1}-kun.
The Nobel Prize is awarded in a number\nof fields, but guess which field doesn't\nget one.
Sorry, but there IS a prize for that field.\nThe answer is... math. Can you believe it?
Yep, that's right! There's no Nobel Prize\nin math for whatever reason!
One popular theory is that a mathematician\nstole Nobel's lover...
It sounds ridiculous, I agree. But at the\nsame time... I kinda get it.
While it's important that we devote ourselves\nto our studies, it's only human to let our\nemotions get the better of us at times.
But don't worry. In terms of world famous\nawards for math, there's still the Fields\nMedal!
Then again, none of you look too worried...\nAnyway, enough chit-chat. Flip open to the\nchapter on algebra, please.
The overly personal reason does make it seem\nfar truer than a nicely manicured life story.
It seems all the more believable because\nhe was true to his desires.
I'd even wager that doing so is the basis of\nhumanity's strength.
Okay, so be sure to remember this theorem...
...to get the length of the midline\nconnecting the vertex on the triangle\nand the midpoint on the other side.
When understood, it can even be used in\ngeometric proofs, so it's a surprisingly\nconvenient theorem.
The fascinating thing about math is that\nseeking efficiency can sometimes lead you\nto common answers.
And I'm not just talking about human\nproblem-solving either. Even bugs make\nsmart use of geometry.
{NAME1}-kun, are you with us? Time for\na little mental workout.
Beehives are made of many regular hexagons.\nWhy do you think that is?
Well... I suppose that could be true as well?\nI'm not an expert on bees.
Mathematically, they save on materials.\nThat was the answer I had in mind.
Ah, that's correct! I see you get what makes\nregular hexagons special.
Three regular polygons can be tessellated.\nTriangles, squares, and hexagons.
Circles are the shape with the shortest\nperimeter. The closest to them of the three\npolygons I mentioned are...
You guessed it. Regular hexagons. It lets\nbees make hives while saving on labor and\nmaterials.
It's a pretty fascinating example, isn't it?\nSee? Math can be cool!
I never knew there was such intentional\ndesign in their hives... Without that\nknowledge, one might never notice.
The more knowledge we obtain, the deeper\nwe can understand the world around us.
It may even aid you in the strengthening\nof your desire.
Okay, today let's do some applied calculus.
Be careful, it's easy to miss these problems\non tests.
Especially the ones with unit conversions!\n"Kilo" means 1,000. Don't forget that.
Not that it matters in nations that use\nthe imperial system...
Units are annoying, I get it.
People use them without understanding what\nthey indicate all the time, too.
Since you're who I saw first, answer this\nfor me, {NAME1}-kun.
What do you think the unit of carats\nindicates when used in jewelry?
I'm afraid not. Though I wouldn't expect\nstudents to know much about gems, anyway.
It's weight. 1 carat is 0.2 grams.
Wow, color me impressed. Yes, a unit\nof weight. 1 carat is 0.2 grams.
Doesn't it seem a little haphazard to weigh\nminerals with different densities, though?
Oh, but I guess they do use the momme for pearls.
I want to say one momme is 3.75 grams?
Did you know that momme is a Japanese unit?
It's used because we were the first to\nsuccessfully farm pearls.
But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone\nwho knows what a momme is. Units can get\nreal complicated real quick, huh?
So the weight of gems is important enough\nthat they command different units?
Hoom... Well, the Treasure we seek is in\na class of its own...
And the term "carats" strikes me as rather\nbizarre...
So how about we measure Treasure in "Lufels"\ninstead? Now there's an idea!
Okay, a quick recap before we really get\ninto higher-order equations.
Equations let you solve the most complex\nproblems if you get the fundamentals down.
Whoever came up with algebra is just amazing.\nThey put together a whole method of thinking!
They must have really been into this way\nof thinking though...
Just kidding... How about a question instead\nof my bad jokes!
Okay, {NAME1}-kun. Pop quiz for you\nto get everyone's brains going again.
Diophantus is known as the father of algebra.\nWhat special item did he place a mathematical\nproblem on?
Nice try, but the answer is his tombstone.\nThat's okay you didn't know. It's just a bit\nof trivia.
Ah, you're a sharp one. That's right,\nhis tombstone.
Diophantus's epitaph contains a word problem\nthat tells you how old he was when he died.
Look it up if you're interested. It's not\nvery hard to solve, either.
But this is quite the tangent from your\ntextbooks. Let's get back to solving\nequations.
A problem inscribed on one's tombstone\nto be solved with one's own methods...\nHow modish.
I would inscribe a riddle involving desire\non mine. Doesn't that sound bold?
...Hoom, why the sour look?
The quiz will cover pages 220 to 284...\nWhich are on amicable numbers. How fun!
Oh, I guess I should explain.
That refers to a pair of numbers whose\ndivisors can be summed up to the other\nnumber.
Natural numbers with unique properties like\nthis sometimes get their own name.
There are a few others... But let's see if\nany of you know them! How about you,\n{NAME1}-kun?
Ooh, not quite... Well, when there's so many\nterms, it can get tricky to remember which\none's which.
Another famous one would be perfect numbers.
When their divisors are summed up, the total equals the perfect number.
Perfect! As in perfect numbers.
28, for example. 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 equals...?
Perfect numbers were even thought to be mystical...
...linked to the moon's 28-day orbit of Earth.
I know they're just numbers, but c'mon,\nthat's pretty neat, right? It's another reason\nwhy I love math.
Right, I was talking about the quiz. Anyway,\nlet's get back to class.
Perfect numbers... Hoom, is 6 not one\nas well? 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6, no?
Finding them seems like it would be such an\nelegant pastime. Now then, what comes after\n6 and 28?
Mr. Hakozaki's the name, teaching chemistry is my game!
We'll have a gas\u2014noble, inert, you name it!
...Boy, tough crowd.
It's always rough with these first few classes...
Oh right, still mid-introduction. Ahem.
I'm a fan of natural sciences above all else. Ecosystems are where it's at!
My favorite scientist is Henry Cavendish!
He's known for discovering hydrogen, but that's not all he did!
Ah, perhaps I ought to open up the floor?\nLet's see here...
I choose you, {PLAYER_NAME}-san!
Henry Cavendish may be an excellent scientist\nbut what was the one thing he never did?
Oh, I guess you could interpret that multiple ways, huh?
Still, uh... socializing was the answer I was looking for.
Yes, that's exactly it! Guess I'm not\nthe only Cavendish connoisseur.
Henry Cavendish was famously antisocial.
He never spoke of his important breakthroughs.
Ohm's law, Charles's law,\neven Coulomb's law...
We know now that all of these and more had\nbeen initially discovered by Cavendish.
Makes you wonder why he published his\nfindings on hydrogen in the first place, huh?
Cavendish was a big inspiration for me.
He taught me that you don't need pals to study.
However, university taught me that it's different nowadays.
People are part of this world and I'm a big fan of them!
I think all this science talk calmed my nerves.
Here's to a year of scientific curiosity!
Keeping major discoveries to oneself...
I would have loved to have gotten a firsthand look at such desire myself.
A desire to satisfy him and him alone.\nHoohoo, magnificent, is it not?
Another day, another chance to enjoy science!
Today we're discussing the nature of sound.
Waves vibrate through air particles, which\nvibrate your eardrums and register as sound.
This ability to detect fine vibrations is what makes the ear so special.
Curious, isn't it?
Say, that reminds me of a hoot of a question!\nAnyone know what's special about owl ears?
Right, let's see what {PLAYER_NAME}-san\nhas to say! Go on, don't be shy, now.
What's so special about owl earholess that\nhelps them with hunting?
Uh-huh, I can see you've thought this through.
But we're talking about hunting here, so...
Their earholes are positioned unevenly!\nThink back to what we said about vibrations.
Right on the money! Amazing! You really\nthought this through, didn't you?
Their ears can determine a sound's source\nthrough horizontal discrepancies and height\nthrough vertical discrepancies.
Since they're nocturnal hunters, they can use\nboth sight and sound to determine differences\nin elevation.
Their forward-facing ears restrict range...
Heheh, the logic of the animal kingdom is\nsomething else. Still, it gets a bit spooky\nfrom time to time.
Like, did you know you can see the back of an\nowl's eyeball through their ear hole? Freaky!
...Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}. Take a look.\nI want to see if my body's the same way.
Wait, one should confirm one's own mysteries\nfor oneself! Though, I never thought I'd be\nthe subject of my own research.
but they can whip their heads around no problem to compensate!
Yikes, I got chewed out at the staff meeting.\nI'm a sad specimen of a science scholar.
They say I'm thick as a brick. But there's a lot to take in in social situations!
Each individual's varying emotions, complicated rules of etiquette... It's difficult!
There was this local female celebrity, you\nknow, Mochizuki Chiyome. She was a head\nshrine maiden that traveled the country.
But rumor has it she was a kunoichi all along.
She convinced women all over Japan to gather intel for her.
Women can be quite persuasive, you see.
I could learn a thing or two from them...
But hey, we've got the internet in the modern age, right?
{PLAYER_NAME}-san, I saw you first,so join me\nfor a little thought experiment.
Fiber-optic cables may connect us with people\naround the globe, but do you have any idea\nhow that was done?
Yes, that's exactly it. The sea's always been\na major obstacle when connecting the world.
Well, it'd be interesting if that was true,\nbut it'd be pretty difficult, don't you\nthink?
They ran the cables along the sea floor.
Even though we're all connected thanks to\nthem, those connections are only as good\nas the people who use the internet.
I'd love to be a ninja or something. Wouldn't\nit be so cool to blend into the shadows...?
Whoops. There I go, babbling again. Sorry,\nlet's jump into the textbooks, shall we?
Goodness, how exhausting.
Not exactly a topic to explore with your students, now was that?
Still, it is very human of him to be pushed\nso off-topic by unrelated factors.
Fiber-optic cables keep the whole world connected!
That's the gist of next class's experiment.
Be careful, we'll be handling dangerous chemicals!
Everyone's safety is key...
...so any potential pranksters will get a serious tongue-lashing!
Daily life can be just as dangerous,\nof course. Make sure you always\nwatch where you're going.
For example, water's pretty dangerous. People drown in rivers and oceans all the time.
Save the horseplay for dry land!
And that's not even the worst thing about\nwater.{PLAYER_NAME}-san, you take\nthis one.
Do you know what happens if you drink too\nmuch water? Think worst-case scenario, here.
I said worst-case scenario, didn't I?
I envy you, if that's the worst you could\nthink of.
Sorry to burst your bubble here,\n{PLAYER_NAME}, but it'll send\nyou to an early grave.
Good, I see you know your stuff.
What's a worse scenario than that, am I right?
I'm happy you've thought this through. Yes,\nyou could literally head to an early grave.
Have you ever heard of water intoxication?\nOur bodies need it, but too much\nis dangerous for you.
A liter or two won't take you out, of course!\nYou'd need more like... fourteen liters.
It's not exactly a volume you can sip by\naccident, but still. Something to keep\nin the back of your mind.
Too much of a good thing is bad for you.\nBe sure to do everything in moderation, okay?
Too little of something and your body can't\nsurvive. Too much, and it crumbles from\nthe strain.
A parable for desire, if I've ever heard one.\nWe would do well to keep our own desires\nin check.
Promise me that!
Thanks for turning in your reports!
And those of you who failed the experiment, keep your chins up!
I saw more examples that made me question how\nthey failed. That's a sure sign of progress!
Make assumptions and hypotheses based\non observations, verify them through\nexperimentation...
...and evaluate the results. That's the\nscientific method!
It's also how humanity arrives at new discoveries.
Take Ignaz Semmelweis for example,\nan incredible eighteenth-century doctor!
He discovered the cause of a large\ndiscrepancy in mortality rates between\ntwo hospital wards.
And now that knowledge has pretty much\nbecome common sense. All right,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san. I choose you!
What was Semmelweis's countermeasure that\nreduced patient mortality rates and is now\ncommon practice?
Hmm, unfortunately not. The answer was\nwashing hands and general disinfecting.
Bit of a curveball, huh? Don't sweat it.\nIt threw me for a loop the first time\nI heard it too.
Well, I've got to hand it to you there!\nThat's right, hand-washing and disinfectant.
Back then, through trying to maintain a\nbalanced temperature or bodily fluids to prevent\nillness, he discovered what we know as disinfecting!
Now is that a cutting-edge discovery or what!\nToo much so, actually\u2014no one believed him.
Ignaz Semmelweis came up with the method, but\ncouldn't prove disinfectant was effective.
Without his great discovery recognized, he\nsuccumed to a mental breakdown, eventually\ndying of a bacterial infection...
I identify with the guy, really, I do. Some\nthings are right, even if you can't prove it.
Having that which you desire rejected, hoom?\nA scenario that gives much food for thought,\nto be sure.
How would that man feel to see a world where\nhis discovery has become common knowledge?
Right, so the earth makes a full revolution\naround the sun once per day, yes?
Everybody knows this now, but presenting the\ntheory was no walk in the park at first.
Before that, everyone thought things revolved\naround Earth... ...so I guess you could say\nthey had their world turned upside down!
This topic is fit for both world history\nand science. Now, riddle me this,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Heliocentric theory is a massive problem\nfor a certain field of study. Care to guess\nwhich?
Hmm, that's outside of my field of expertise,\nbut I don't think it'd cause a big problem\nthere.
I was looking for "religion." Religion held\ngreat authority in old Western\nculture.
Exactly, religion. This put a big damper on\nreligion's sway over Western culture!
Back then, it was just accepted as fact that\nwe were at the center of the universe.
The idea of everything revolving around the\nsun was a hard pill for many to swallow.
Still, what you believe and what is true\nisn't always the same thing.
I hope all of you will come to assess things\nwith your own eyes, not just fall back on\nbias.
It's important to fit in with your peers, but\nI think the pursuit of truth is way cooler!
What you believe isn't the same as what is\ntrue... Poignant words worth remembering.
One must always pursue the truth that lies\nahead, not ingratiate oneself to one's peers.
So, we believe the survival of the fittest\nidea explains how life changes form and\nnature.
Various theories continue to be tested...
Heck, some even posit it's more of a "survival of the luckiest."
I'd argue, however, that organs which are\nactually unnecessary tend to degenerate, and\nthe environment plays a major factor.
You've heard about deep-sea fish, right?\nThey don't need to sense light, so they've\nbecome blind.
Even humans have a body part that could\ndisappear because we don't need it anymore.
Heheh, I bet that got your gears\nturning. All right, I'll ask you,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Which part of the human body could possibly\ndegenerate and, eventually, disappear?
Sorry, but you kind of still need those.\nThe answer is our pinky toes!
Cooorrect! The answer is our pinky toes.
Don't you feel like you don't use yours much?
Humans kick off of their big toe to walk,\nputting almost no weight on their pinky toe.
Losing toes is not all that rare in the\nanimal kingdom. After all, horses have\nsingle hoofs, don't they?
That's the result of an evolved middle toe.\nA shape adapted to a life of sprinting.
Humans could shed toes to speed up, too.
Ho ho, now wouldn't that be a funny future to look forward to!
Hoohoo, the human form still has room for\nimprovement, from the sound of it!
If desire alters the shape of a species, who\nknows what form future humans might take.
...This means that when minerals are\nclassified, they are done so based on\nwhether or not they have color.
What's another property we might use to\nclassify minerals? Hardness. The Mohs scale\nis the most well-known measure for this.
They're rated on a scale from one to ten\nfor their scratch resistance. It's a useful\nscale to reference when excavating ore.
Ooh, I know! Let's bring this topic a bit\ncloser to home. {PLAYER_NAME}-san,\nyou take this one.
Which part of the human body is harder than\niron and registers seven on the Mohs scale?
Ding ding ding, correctamundo! It's the\nenamel on your teeth.
Aaand... Bzzt, wrong! The answer is\nthe enamel on adult teeth.
Our bones come in at around four or five\non the scale, making them about as tough\nas iron or glass.
Though the Mohs scale only denotes resistance\nto being scratched, not breaking.
Besides, our teeth take a ton of stress.\nWe grind them with the same force as our\nbody weight!
One of my friends chipped a tooth\non chocolate cake once...\nHis teeth were in bad shape.
Teeth are tough, but you have to take good care of them!
...I've gone on a bit of a tangent. Let's get back to the lesson.
Hard to scratch doesn't mean hard to break...\nSounds like the human spirit, if you ask me.
Anyone can suffer unexpected heartbreak.\nThose who study desire should bear this\nin mind.
That should cover plant classification.\nWait until we get to animals, though.\nThey're way more complicated!
People use mnemonics to remember this stuff,\nbut rote memorization's so boring, if you\nask me.
Still, organized knowledge is good for\nhelping you recollect things in an instant.
When we come across a new species...
...that shared knowledge provides us the\nconfidence to identify them in an instant!
The names of new species sure are funny. You\nget a sense of its discoverer's personality.
There's one name I really love.\nLet's see if you know anything about it,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
True or false: the name of the spicy\ncomponent in ginger is called shogaol.
Right you are! It's derived from the Japanese\nword for ginger. Isn't that cool?
Heheh, I can see that confused you a bit, but\nit's true. That's the name of that component.
There's also sanshool, the spicy component\nof the Japanese "sansho" pepper.
Then there's nattokinase, the catabolic\nenzyme found in natto, fermented beans.
There's even a type of crustacean named\nafter an anime character!
Pretty fun, right!? Science is a human\ncreation, but it's stuff like that that makes\nit feel even more human.
Desire that can be gleaned from names, is it?\nWhat a refreshing way to look at them!
Hmm... Makes me wonder what sort of desire\none can derive from your name.
And that's it for chemical reactions. They're\npretty complicated stuff, so make sure you\ntake notes on this, class.
People say we only consult them\nduring experiments...
...but that couldn't be further from\nthe truth.
You see them all the time in our daily lives.\nFor example: disposable hand warmers!
Iron reacts with oxygen in the air and turns\nto iron oxide, generating heat in the\nprocess.
Say you want to use a hand warmer going to\nand from school but pause its reaction while\nin class. How would you do so?
Hmm... Not sure that would cut the mustard.\nThe answer is sealing it in a bag.
Those hand warmers use the heat made\nfrom iron oxide reactions, so in order to\nstop said reaction...
This will regulate when the iron changes\nto iron oxide, letting you control when\nthe hand warmer heats up.
Learning the basics of how things work\nlets you use them in new ways like this
or even repair and reuse them!
Such mechanisms are both fun and useful\nto learn about, so keep your curiosity\npiqued!
Hoohoo? I've never used such a hand warmer.\nWhat a fascinating contrivance.
But does this mean that everyone carries\naround iron in the winter? Quite amusing\nwhen you think of it that way.
I'm Mr. Shimonuma, and you're stuck with me\nfor social studies this year.
Let's get one thing straight right away...
If you think this class is hard, then\ntoo bad.
My classroom, my rules. In here, I am\nthe law.
Don't like that, kids?
Without the law, you'd have far worse things\nto worry about.
You there, with the cheeky look on your face!
{PLAYER_NAME}! Try this one on for size.
According to Hobbes'\nsocial contract theory...
...what is the state of human society\nabsent law?
Tch... You really are a cheeky one.
Yes, war. Hobbes called it "the war of all\nagainst all."
Man, you kids really are clueless.
The answer is war! "The war of all\nagainst all," as Hobbes called it.
Every person values nothing more than\npreserving their own life and happiness.
The state of nature is such that one may\ndo anything for that goal.
But if everyone acted upon that right\nin this natural state...
So Hobbes says we must make contracts\nwith each other to forge a political society.
Without me here to teach you the value\nof the law...
Law can be a manifestation of desire...
...but this man seems to simply enjoy\nwielding his own authority.
I suppose he's honest about his desires.\nBut still, I can't say it's a pretty sight.
We'd all end up killing each other.
In return, we get security if we follow\nthe sovereign's rules.
You kids would be nothing but savages!
All right, today we're talking about taxes.
To quote Yukichi Fukuzawa on the subject...
"A government enacts laws to control the bad\nand protect the good. This means that laws\nare a government's trade."
The "trade" he refers to is a capitalist one.\nCitizens purchase their safety via taxes.
If this trade is obstructed, well then...\nLet's take a look at 18th-century France.
Unregulated tax collectors had left\nthe common folk unable to afford\neven the bare necessities.
People turned to the black market to survive.\nAll right, {PLAYER_NAME}!
Which of these three was a famous smuggler?\nLet's see if your French history\nis up to par.
Hah! You've got a lot of catchin' up to do.\nYou think the royal family was out smuggling?
The correct answer is Louis Mandrin. Process\nof elimination could tell you as much!
Tch... You're right. The correct answer is\nLouis Mandrin.
Perhaps when a state fails its people, they\nno longer have an obligation to obey\nits laws.
Which is not to say that France forgave\ncriminals like Mandrin. No, he was executed.
Now let's bring our discussion back to Japan.\nThe system of taxation in our country is...
To me, it seems terribly unfortunate.
But perhaps Mandrin himself would have said\nit was worth it, to live true to\nhis desires...
for the story of a man like that to end\nin an execution.
In the "Analects," it's said that Confucius\ndidn't talk on extraordinary things, feats of\nstrength, disorder...
...and spiritual beings. In short, Confucius\nthought it best to not discuss things we\ndon't properly understand.
But Confucius was also supposedly one of\nthe sages who contributed to the creationof I Ching divinat\u2014
None of this is making it into your skulls,\nI see. You kids are trying me today...
Confucius said not to speak of the unknown,\nbut studied divination. Is this\ncontradictory?
I knew this would surpass your\nunderstanding. Now listen up, kiddies.
There is no contradiction. I'll explain why.
Tch... So you already knew.\nIndeed, there is no contradiction.
Today, divination is seen as\nmystical nonsense...
Different strokes for different folks.\nCultural standards vary with the era.
The delights of the past might be\nhorrific today.
Consider public executions in England and\nFrance. Even people in Edo Japan apparently\nheld similar spectacles.
That might be a bad example, though.\nI imagine most of you would enjoy\npublic executions too.
When one is condemned to death, so too is\nall one's desire. Who could ever find joy\nin that?
Phantom thieves must always act with purpose.\nYou understand,{NAME2}?
You there! {PLAYER_NAME}!
As a result, fundamental human rights were\nestablished in modern Japan, and citizens'\nlives were guaranteed.
In particular, civil liberties and equal\nrights in our Constitution guarantee freedom\nof speech and prohibit discrimination.
In reality, there were times and countries\nwhere the rights you all take for granted did not exist.
Take 17th century Europe, for example. Even\nthough liberal ideas had taken root, there\nwere still problems with human rights.
Cases of class-based discrimination, unequal\nrights for women, and inequitable court\nrulings were prevalent.
However, there was one who indirectly\nresisted this inequality... Tch! You all look\nlike you're falling asleep.
Hey, {NAME1}! You seem to be wide awake.\nTry answering this one.
Which 17th century artist created paintings\nwith a revenge theme, and is regarded as the\ngreatest female painter of the Baroque?
Tch... You're unexpectedly encyclopedic.\nYes, the answer is Artemisia Gentileschi.
Wrong. For starters, the gender doesn't even\nmatch. The correct answer is\nArtemisia Gentileschi.
Gentileschi was unfairly tried in court and\nreleased a work based on her\nown experience...
Her works were powerful and appealed to\npublic opinion, and she gradually gained\nmass recognition for her artistic skill.
It's not as though her works completely\neliminated discrimination of course, but they\nmay have given courage to many women.
Indirect actions of great figures like\nGentileschi empowered everyday people to push\nfor the establishment of human rights.
Looks like you sleepy kids need a wake-up\ncall! Eyes open, people! Class is still\nin session!
Even in an unfair situation, people kept\nfighting against inequality, and their\nefforts were eventually rewarded...
No matter the circumstances, never abandon\nyour desires. A good lesson. We, too, should\nstrive to follow this example.
You kids have no idea how tough it gets out\nin the real world. Money doesn't come easy!
A former acquaintance of mine thinks if you\njust start investing, you can make it.\nWhat a moron.
Never forget: society is vicious.
Especially when money's involved!
Take, for example, the storybook way\nto get rich quick: buried treasure.
Eyes up front, {PLAYER_NAME}.\nWhat d'you think would happen if you\nunearthed some buried treasure?
Hahah, don't think in extremes, kid.\nIn reality, it'd be split between you\nand the landowner.
Tch, look who's clever today. That's right,\nyou'd split it with the landowner.
Even if you dig it up with your own\ntwo hands, some guy you've never met\nstill gets a share.
You would've needed permission from the\nlandowner to dig there in the first place, so\nperhaps it's fair.
From the owner's perspective,\nit's instant profit...
...but they still have to pay the digger.
There's no easy money out there,\nnot even in silly fantasy scenarios.\nRemember that, kids!
And yet... I know my former acquaintance\nwill always come out on top.
They always know just what to say... Argh...
Alas, such withered desire... How fleeting\ndesire directed at oneself can be...
Not that it's any of our business, I suppose.\nNo matter how much he may resent\nsomeone else.
"Heaven does not create one man above or\nbelow another man." So said Yukichi Fukuzawa\nin his "An Encouragement of Learning."
It's often quoted alone like that, but there's more to it.
Fukuzawa actually goes on to say distinctions do exist...
And to overcome these inequalities,\nwe must educate ourselves. Under\ncapitalism, the educated will profit.
Learn practical skills and how to make\nmoney. That's the gist of it.
Learn that, and you'll succeed in a\ncapitalist world, Fukuzawa said.
Are you brats even listening to me!?\nYou there, {PLAYER_NAME}!
In "An Encouragement of Learning," why\ndoes Fukuzawa tell us to pursue education?
Exactly right. "An Encouragement of Learning" advocates\nfor us to understand how to make\nmoney\u2014practical education!
I knew you weren't listening! Can't even\ncount on students to pay attention in\nclass anymore...
"An Encouragement of Learning" advocates\nfor practical education like understanding\nhow to make money. It's common sense!
Now, on to the next section.
Now, on to the next section. You'd all better\npay attention, or you'll each be getting\na pop quiz!
So learning how to profit monetarily\nis called "practical education"?\nReasonable enough.
Perhaps we could consider studies that\nrelate to phantom thievery "practical\neducation" too!
The philosopher Diogenes the Cynic famously\ndressed in rags and lived on the\ncity streets.
All out of disdain for material pleasure...\nTch. Oh, and in case the internet misinformed\nyou:
Yes, there's a mental disorder known as\nDiogenes syndrome that has symptoms of\ngarbage-hoarding and self-neglect.
But, while social withdrawal and lack of care\nfor one's appearance can somewhat\nresemble Diogenes...
this is a purely superficial resemblance.\nDiogenes's teachings were nothing like that.
Diogenes argued that we should free\nourselves of desire and find happiness\nwithin ourselves.
That's probably not the least bit relatable\nfor you bambinos, though... Try this one on\nfor size, {PLAYER_NAME}!
Hah, not even close. Just guessing?\nThe answer is exercise to train the body\nand mind.
Tch, how the heck did you know that? Yes,\nit was exercise to train the body and mind.
A healthy mind will dwell in a healthy body.\nOr at least that's the general idea.
But your generation so loves to categorize\nthings based on their superficial\nappearances...
I truly hate this ridiculous world sometimes.
Hoom, it is indeed unpleasant to be lumped\ninto a group and generalized about like that!
Human desire comes in many shapes,\nso we had best not make assumptions.
Earlier, I sprang a pop quiz onto another\nclass. I guess the questions were pretty\ntough, but still...
They were crying at me, "but pop quizzes\nare impossible!"
As if that were even an excuse. Always be\nprepared!
Living in society means encountering\n"impossible" things every day.
Did I see you look away just now,\n{PLAYER_NAME}? That's some\nnerve you've got. Answer me this!
Is it impossible to encounter a flood\nin a desert?
Oh, are we a contrarian now? Annoyingly\nenough, you're correct.
Hah, not a thought in your head today, huh?\nAs a matter of fact, it is possible.
A desert is defined as an area with extremely\nlow rainfall covered in sand or stone.
But in many cases when it rains in the\ndesert, a year's worth of rain falls\nin a single day.
What happens then when all that rain drains\nthrough the sand without plants to absorb it?
It all rushes straight across the land,\ncreating a flash flood.
This world is full of things you think aren't\npossible\u2014and not just out in the desert!
So always be prepared for the impossible,\nkids. Because like it or not, you WILL be\ngetting more pop quizzes from me.
Attitude aside, his advice is sound.\nWe can never be truly certain what the\nfuture holds.
A phantom thief must be prepared for\nall eventualities.
Do you understand, {PLAYER_NAME}?
In modern Japan we use cash currency,\nwhich is issued by the state and the\nnational bank.
As every middle schooler knows, the\nBank of Japan prints banknotes...
...and the government mints coins.
Naturally, there are costs to producing cash.\nSome denominations are even made at a loss...
All right, {PLAYER_NAME}! Are you even\nlistening? Let's put that to the test.
Which denomination of yen does the\ngovernment take a loss to produce?
Tch, you're right. It's obvious enough when\nyou consider which has the least cash value.
Wrong! Did you even try to use your brain?\nThe correct answer is the one-yen coin.
It varies based on the going rate for metals,\nbut making a one-yen coin costs roughly\nthree yen.
So the Mint loses two yen for every one-yen\ncoin it makes. Other coins make up for it,\nthough.
Places like the EU have proposed eliminating\nsmall denomination coins to avoid these\ncosts.
Electronic payment systems could perhaps\nsolve this problem too, but that requires\nlegislation.
So the currency you usually use might just\ndisappear? I suppose you'd get used to it\nonce it's gone...
So many humans don't even care about\ntheir own desires; what's a coin or two to\nthem?
Are you kids familiar with the civil rights\nleader Martin Luther King Jr?
Does MLK ring a bell, perhaps? He's the\nman who gave the famous "I Have a Dream"\nspeech.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964\nfor his contributions to the nonviolent\nstruggle against racial discrimination.
He was shot and killed before he could\nachieve his goals.
So Mrs. King took over his cause and founded\na center for nonviolent social change\nin his name.
You kids look like it's your naptime again.\nLook alive, {PLAYER_NAME}!
Can you name the woman who, despite facing\ndiscrimination, won two Nobel Prizes?
Tch, didn't fall for it, huh? Yes,\nthe correct answer is Mrs. Marie Curie.
She received her first prize jointly with her\nhusband, Pierre...
...and the second on her own.
Despite society's biases against women...
...she proved herself even after her\nhusband's death.
You should remember both MLK and Curie...
...for their accomplishments in spite of\ndiscrimination.
It takes exceptional courage to rise up\nand fight oppression...
...whoever you are.
Desires you don't act on are meaningless\nto others. We should always remember that.
As you can see, I'm a bit up there in age.\nThere may be times we don't see eye to eye...
But I think we'll go far if we take it slow\nand steady. Former U.S. president Roosevelt\nsaid similar.
Speak softly and\u2014
Actually, I should probably ask if any\nof you know.
So, based on today's date and your\nstudent numbers...
{PLAYER_NAME}-san,\nit's your time to shine.
Theodore Roosevelt's approach to policy\nin the Caribbean was...
"Speak softly and carry a big\nsomething\u2014you will go far."
As for that something... What did Roosevelt\ncarry in his foreign policy?
That would be nice if true.
But no. It's a big stick, or military might.
That's right. A big stick. It's meant\nto imply military might.
Through armed interventions in the Caribbean,\nthe U.S. secured its own interests\nand prevented any European intervention.
There is power in being the one to wield\nthe big stick.
Personally, however, I'd rather not have\nto wield it either.
Life has its ups and downs, as does history.
They say not to judge a book by its cover...
...but she seems to be a brave soul\nwith a big stick.
She talks of life's ups and downs...\nLet us strive to learn as much as we\ncan from her in that regard.
I look forward to learning\nfrom those experiences with you all.
All right, let's continue our lesson\non the French Revolution with the period\nknown as the Reign of Terror.
After the rebellion, there was a wave of\nexecutions of enemies to the Revolution,\nand as a result...
the Revolutionaries also faced execution\nthemselves. Robespierre was particularly\nprominent during this time.
There are many reasons he was executed...
But I feel the main one was that the public\nhated him. It's very important that you\ngarner favor with others.
If favored, even a thief can become a hero.\nI'm sure you've all heard the term\n"righteous thief."
But based on the chance of rain\ntoday... Let's double-check with\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Which of these people is the thief\nwho inspired Slovakia's Robin Hood?
Hmm, well, considering how great he was,\nhe may have done many things overseas.
But that wasn't what I was looking for.\nThe answer is Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk.
That's right. Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk. It's not a name\nyou hear often, is it?
This thief broke the law and stole property,\nand yet, the public still loved him...
That's because he stole\nfrom the oppressive rich...
...and shared his ill-gotten gains\nwith the public and other\ninfluential people in town.
Robespierre also fought against inequality,\nbut all he gave the people was fear.
That's why everyone resented him so much.\nWill you be liked or hated? It's tough\nto say.
So, the difference between them all\nboiled down to public reception. I'm not sure\nif I agree with that or not.
They each followed the path of their desires\nto the very end. But those decisions to do so\nwere theirs alone to make.
All right, class... Today we'll be heading\nto ancient Rome. There's a famous\nexpression about Rome.
It goes "all roads lead to Rome." It refers\nto the road network in and around the area.
But these roads don't just lead to Rome.\nThey extended all the way to France, England,\nand even Africa.
Measures were taken to make transit on them\neasier. However, these roads were more than\nmere connections.
Let's see... Based on today's high\nand your student numbers...
What material was not used for Roman roads?\nHere's a hint... It doesn't last long.
That's right. They never used wood.\nThe reason is because it rots quickly.
Yes, you'd be inclined to think that.\nI understand exactly where you're\ncoming from.
But I'm afraid that's not right. They never\nused wood. The reason is because it\nrots quickly.
They increased the roads' stability by using\nfour layers of cement and stones\nof various sizes.
To prevent flooding, the center was elevated\nand drainage ditches were added to\nboth sides.
That these roads are still in use after 2000\nyears is a testament to their durability.
The Roman Empire knew how important\ninfrastructure was to controlling\ntheir expansive territory.
Hoom! So, they really used cement back then?\nThey were as sophisticated as people\nare today!
Could the Romans' desires have spurred them\nto be so? Desires truly drive people\nto improve...
The characters in my name may give off the\nimage of valleys and mountains, but I'm\nhonestly not one for hiking.
All right, class. We'll be moving onto the\nfour great civilizations. Today, we'll be\nfocusing on Egypt.
Though we refer to it all as Ancient Egypt...
...the areas that flourished in the\ncivilization changed from era to era.
Both Upper and Lower Egypt had their own\nkingdoms. While there were conflicts,\nthey gradually became integrated.
...But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself mentioning "upper" and "lower."
Look at the handout I just passed out.
Civilization was founded along the Nile\nRiver, and there were kingdoms up and down\nthe river.
Based on the number of people I saw this\nmorning in red... {PLAYER_NAME}-san.
Which Egypt do you think diagram A shows?
Hmm, yes, it does appear that way.\nBut, you're wrong. It's Lower Egypt.
Instead of looking at the map as top versus\nbottom, it's better to think upstream versus\ndownstream.
Lower Egypt is correct. Instead of looking\nat the map as top versus bottom...
...it's better to think upstream versus\ndownstream.
It's easy to get confused since the lower\npart is at the top, but just think of it from\nthe perspective of someone living there.
Keep in mind what was most intuitive for them\nand you'll never forget. Always make sure to\nexamine things from the ground up.
So, now that we have a grasp of how Ancient\nEgypt was orientated, we can cover its\npolitics and culture.
Hoohoo! A misconception derived from only looking at things from a map.
It's a definitive example of armchair theory... How riveting.
All right, class. Today we'll be moving onto\nAncient Greece. There's really a lot to learn\nabout and from this period in history.
It had a huge impact on Western culture. Much\nof it still remains relevant to this day.
For instance, the Pythagorean theorem in\nmath. It was discovered by the ancient Greek\nPythagoras.
There are other examples as well, but let's see if any of you know some.
Using today's humidity and your student\nnumbers, let's ask... {PLAYER_NAME}-san.
The word "melancholy" historically referred\nto a secretion... Which organ did that\nsecretion come from?
Well, yes, that is one of the organs\nassociated most with feelings of\ngreat sadness.
But you're a bit off the mark. The answer is\nthe liver. To be precise, melancholy is the\nbile secreted from there.
That's right. It's the liver. To be precise,\nmelancholy is the bile secreted from there.
Melancholy was originally used in humorism,\na medical theory claiming unbalanced humors\naffect health and temperament.
Melancholy is an excess of black bile...\nMelan- means "black,"\nand -choly means "bile."
Sadness can be a precursor to the seven\ndeadly sins, so black bile was not looked\nupon favorably.
Knowing what we know now, this theory must\nsound like a joke, right?
But this theory was supported until the birth\nof morbid anatomy in the 19th century.
The basis for what we consider common sense\nhas, historically speaking, only been\ndiscovered relatively recently.
Hoom... She has a point. Current common\nknowledge could easily be shelved by\nnew discoveries.
Hoohoo, what desires would lead to\nsuch discoveries? I'd like to see for\nmyself someday.
So, Emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have\nbuilt the original Great Wall to protect\nthe people against invaders...
His wall was repaired and relocated during\nseveral later dynasties before it took shape\nas the Great Wall as we know it today.
Most of the surviving sections are from\nthe Ming Dynasty and located further south\nthan in the Qin Dynasty.
In Chinese, the Great Wall is known as "the\n10,000 li-long wall." Does anyone know how\nlong this world heritage site really is?
Oh, would you look at the time.\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san, it's your\ntime to shine.
A li is also known as the Chinese mile, but would that make the Great Wall 10,000 miles long?
I understand wanting to give a clear-cut\nanswer. But there isn't one this time.
Precisely. What is considered one "li" depends on where and when you are in history.
In present-day Japan, one li is about\n2.44 miles, but in Qin China, one li was\na little over a quarter of a mile.
Quite the difference, right? The distance\nalso changes depending on whether or not\nyou include the mountains and valleys.
In 2012, the Great Wall was measured at a\nlength of approximately 13,170 miles... That\nequals a whopping 53,000 Chinese li.
Which means it's not the "10,000 li-long\nwall" after all. So, in short, there isn't\nreally a clear-cut answer on this one.
Heehee! A very tricky question, indeed.\nDon't worry, though. It won't be on the exam.
I see. Whether it's correct or not depends on\nthe viewer's outlook and knowledge.
That was certainly a duplicitous problem,\nbut I'll let it slide for the knowledge it\nprovided.
Today we'll be going over four cradles of\ncivilization of the so-called "Old World."\nLet's start off with the basics.
Here we have Mesopotamian, Indus Valley, Nile\nValley and Yellow River civilizations. Try to\nassociate them with their topography.
There are times when words alone are\nenough to figure out where on the map\na civilization was.
Based on how many corn flakes were in my\ncereal this morning... {PLAYER_NAME}-san,\nwhy don't you try to answer?
Which of the following civilization names\nreflects what the area around it looked like?
That's right. Great job. The correct answer\nis Mesopotamia.
Well, that does have the name of the river in\nit, so as long as you know where that is...
But that wasn't what I was looking for.\nMesopotamia is the correct answer.
The other three are named after their\nneighboring rivers, but that's not the case\nwith Mesopotamia.
The meso- part means "between" and -potamia means "river."
Together, they translate to "the land between two rivers."
It got that name because it was located\nbetween the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
See, what did I tell you? Learning a few\nwords probably made it a bit easier to\nremember the other names too, right?
You youngsters are always looking for\nshortcuts, but seemingly irrelevant info\ncan prove its worth at times.
I'll do my best to give you all more hints to\nlevel up your knowledge, so make sure to pay\nattention in class, okay?
I see... It's similar to how we phantom\nthieves havea knack for finding infiltration\nclues from seemingly unrelated things.
Hoohoo... I never realized education and\nphantom thievery had so much in common.
All right, class. Today we'll be going over\nthe Age of Discovery, a time of great\nexpansion for European society...
...when Columbus arrived in the New World,\nVasco da Gama pioneered a route to India,\nand Magellan circumnavigated the globe.
Spices were the reason Magellan gave when\nasked what motivated his reckless journey.
Based on the number of birds I saw outside on\nthe telephone lines earlier... why don't you\ntry to answer, {PLAYER_NAME}-san?
Why did spices play a major role in\nMagellan's expedition around the world?
Sure, it'd be nice if that was true... but\nit's completely wrong. Money is the answer.
That's right. Huge profits to be had from\ntrade were the driving force for sea route\ndevelopment.
When someone tries something new, we often\nsay it was to achieve their dream or satisfy\ntheir sense of adventure.
But the real motivating factor is money.\nNothing can be done without it.
Money buys you food and housing, but what do\ndreams and adventurous spirit get you?
It's kind of sad, but it's the truth.
It was the same for the explorers in the Age of Discovery.
They couldn't fill their stomachs with dreams\nand adventure. That said, there are also\nthings money can't buy.
Personally, I'd prefer a desire so strong\nthat it would give me the means to be\nsatisfied in both ways.
All right, class... That about does it for the start of the Norman Conquest.
It was a major event for the UK and France, so be sure to keep it in your memory banks.
The relationship between those two countries\ngoes very deep. We're still affected by it,\neven here in Japan after all.
Let's see, looking at who's in class today...\n{PLAYER_NAME}-san, why don't you\ntry to answer?
We call the meat of a cow "beef," but where\ndoes that word come from?
You'd think so, right? I mean, it is English,\nafter all. But that's incorrect. It's France.
That's right. It's France. "Beef" actually\ncomes from French.
England and France are only about 21 miles\napart, so they've shared quite a bit of\nlanguage and culture with each other.
For reference, it's about 18 miles from Tokyo\nto Yokohama. So two countries really are\nneighbors.
Because European nations are so close to each\nother, there are lots of examples of their\ncultures mixing like this.
Grasping the relationships of the countries\non the map makes it a bit easier to\nunderstand historical events.
Modern history is all about political\nrelationships, so the sooner you learn them,\nthe easier your future exams will be.
It does sound strange to say that places as\nclose as Yokohama and Tokyo speak different\nlanguages.
But I've also heard distance has no relation\nto languages. Hoohoo... Maybe you should take\nthis occasion to learn another language.
Okay, onto our next topic: the travels of\nthe adventurer Marco Polo.
He was also known for elaborately\ncalling the little islands of Japan\n"Zipangu, the Land of Gold."
But he never actually visited Japan, it's\nsaid that he heard the name passed on\nincorrectly through word of mouth.
It may sound ridiculous, but this kind of\nthing happens all ofthe time.
Now, I'm gonna pick one of you at random to answer...
{PLAYER_NAME}-san, it's your lucky day!
How did the Canary Islands get their name?\nThis is another case of a misunderstanding.
Well, that would make sense. But I did say\nit was a misunderstanding...
So, you're wrong. Its many dogs is\nthe correct answer.
That's right. Great job. There are many\ndogs there.
The Latin word for dog is "canis."\nThe islands got their name from that\nbecause of the many wild dogs there.
And when a new kind of bird was discovered\nthere, it was named "canary" after\nthe island.
However, most of us today believe that\nit was because there are a lot of birds\non this island.
Heheh, so while we may think we know what\nwe're talking about, people in the future\nmay laugh at us.
As long as what we are looking for is a bird,\nthe original meaning doesn't matter.
It isn't the name that's important, but the essence.
It's much like a desire in that sense.
Hello, I'm Mr. Endou. I have the pleasure of\nteaching you English, an indispensable crutch\nif you ever need to flee the country.
Hm... Was that a little too dramatic?\nBut it's true. And I would be lying if I said\nI didn't want to escape, too.
However, let us set that aside for the time\nbeing. Learning a foreign language is one of\nthe best things you can do.
While you can talk to a hundred million\npeople in Japanese, you could talk to over\na billion in English.
That said, learning it as your second\nlanguage puts you at a bit of a disadvantage.
You'll have to play catchup with\nthe native speakers in regard to\npronunciation and vocab.
That's why I'm a fan of constructed\nlanguages.
They're made by people instead of emerging\nnaturally, so it levels the playing field\na bit.
But of course, they're not perfect.
Let's see if you know, um...\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
What's the most widely recognized constructed\nlanguage meant to be used as an international\nauxiliary language?
Yes, Esperanto. You're quite the diligent\nstudent. Around a million people speak it,\napparently.
I should've known.
Lofty goals get you nowhere without widespread recognition...
But I'm afraid the answer is Esperanto.\nAround a million people speak it, and yet...
There are reasons it hasn't caught on, such\nas a lack of cultural background...
But also...
Everyone has to work equally hard to learn it.
With so many people who speak English, would an English speaker really bother?
I think it makes sense, personally.
It's really hard work for those of us who have to master a new language.
But enough about my ideals for an\nEsperanto-speaking world. For now, let's just\ntry our best to study English this year.
All of humanity striving to overcome the language barrier...
I think that's a splendid desire to have!
I would gladly contribute to such a grand ambition.
Maybe I should look into this Esperanto a bit more...
In this case, this means "Betty was looking\nforward to it." The rest of the translation\nis up to you.
But don't think you can just sit and memorize\nevery idiom. There are way too many to\ndo that.
Luckily, English phrases are composed of\nwords, and words always have an etymology\nand meaning.
Learning how to decode those can give\nvaluable insight when you come across a new word.
Hm... Okay, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nSee if you can get this one.
"Abduct." "Only." "Never." Which word is\nderived from a number?
Sorry, that's not it.
Yes, that's correct.
It comes from "one" plus -ly. And of course\nit means "one of a kind."
The prefix ab- means "away," which helps\nidentify its meaning of carring away someone\nor something.
The "ne-" part was an old form of "not."\nHence its meaning of not ever.
Each part of an English word has meaning.\nThe same as ideograms or the kanji we use\nin Japanese.
It's not always that simple, of course.
But the more you know, right?
English and Japanese look so different...
Hoom. In other words, while a foreign custom\nmay seem nonsensical to us, it still has its\nown purpose and history. How intriguing.
I never thought they'd function in similar ways.
Many students get hung up on numbers when\nreading in English. Let me give you a little\ntrick to reading them correctly.
We count numbers one way in Japanese.\nFor us it makes perfect sense, and it's what\nour brains are used to.
So it can be difficult to read big numbers when saying them out loud in a foreign language.
Let's see you give it a shot,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
One "oku" in Japanese is a large amount.\nBut how much exactly is it?
I did say it was hard, to be fair.\nBut one oku is one hundred million.
Well, aren't you good with numbers?\nYou're right. It's one hundred million.
Large numbers are especially confusing\nbecause they're split up differently\nin Japanese and English.
In English, you can have up to\none hundred "thousands." But in Japanese,\n"ten thousand" is its own unit.
English numbers change every three zeros.\nThese are marked with commas.
100,000,000 is one hundred million...
...because 100 comes before the first comma.
Makes sense, since writing numerals like this\nwas invented in the English-speaking world.
Might not help much on your exam, but keep\nit in mind for the future anyway.
So many unique ways of counting... Human\ninventions like these are truly impressive.
It could be interesting to think about what\ndesires caused these divergences.
I won't name names...
...but I had one student who really made me\nhappy to be a teacher.
They had the most sincere look on their face,\nbut then told me, "You're such a busybody!"
I think they meant I work hard to help them.\nFinding the right words in a second language\ncan be hard...
Differences in nuance like this exist in\nevery language, including both English\nand Japanese.
Take "fate" and "destiny," for example.
They are similar, but slightly different.
Right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun?\nLet's test your sense for nuance.
Compared to "destiny," is "fate" more\npositive or negative of a word?
I'm afraid you're wrong. "Fate" is actually\nmore negative.
Nice intuition. You have a knack for this I see!
It comes from the Latin for "thing spoken by\nthe gods." It's used to mean an inescapable\nresult\u2014much like death.
A god's word cannot be changed, no matter\nwhat. That's what makes it negative.
"Destiny" stems from a word meaning\n"make firm." Thus, it carries an air\nof decisiveness.
But through willpower, you can intervene\nand change things, so "destiny" is used to\nrefer to the unknown.
Word choice is critical in every language.
There are plenty of words with similar meanings but different nuances.
I can think of quite a few of them,\nbut how about you all...?
But wait, what about words that also have the same nuance...?
How are "flammable" and "inflammable" different?
As you said, it's often used in a bad sense.
That's why today we'll be focusing on boosting your vocabulary.
I'm handing back your pop quiz results today.\nThere were... quite a few spelling mistakes.
Don't worry, learning English spelling was\nhard for me, as well. Like, what's that first\n"d" in "Wednesday" doing there anyway?
Speaking of which, there are some interesting\ndifferences between English and Japanese.
Word order, how the sentence subject works...\nEvery little thing seems different.\nAnd yet...
The days of the week have the same origins.
Let me ask you something,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Where do both English and Japanese get their\nnames for the days of the week from?
Yes, it's astronomy. Thanks for answering\ncorrectly.
Well, you tried, and that's what counts.\nThe answer is actually astronomy.
The names of the days refer to the distance\nto other planets in our solar system.
Monday, "Moon Day." Saturday, "Saturn Day."\nSunday is of course "Sun Day."
Don't tell me, "But the moon's not a planet!"
Whether in Asia or Europe, it was the same.\nEveryone looked to the sky to measure time.
It's kind of touching when you think about\nit. We all see the same sky, wherever we are.
Hoom, "touching" is an interesting way to put it.
It is... special to meet someone who feels\nmoved by such things, is it not?
It isn't, but it is what people perceived back then.
Though some do say though we may be apart, our souls are connected.
Let's translate the part about Ken\njoining the football club. It's a popular\nextracurricular activity in America.
I'd go so far as to say it's culturally important there, as people even play it casually.
What would be a casual sport in Japan...? Dodgeball?
When dodgeball was imported to Japan,\nthe original name apparently scared people.
You can dodge a ball, but you can't dodge\na quiz from me. Let's go with... you,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
What was dodgeball originally called?\nRemember, it sounded frightening.
Hmm, perhaps I could have given you a better\nhint... I'm afraid the answer was "Deadball."
Ding, ding, ding! The good ol' ball of death!\nI can see why people were scared.
The name changed after the rules were altered\nto allow players to catch the ball.
"Dodge" helps explain the rules...
...but "dead" just leaves you scratching\nyour head.
I love to think about that, personally. With\na suitable name it spread far and wide!
Another day of learning where words come\nfrom and how to use them! Are you ready?\nLet's return to our textbooks.
A name that can be polished to fulfill a role...
Maybe we should revisit our code names sometime?
I could go by Deadcattle instead...\nNo, never mind. That is too ominous.
Line 5! Ken saw the matching uniforms, and...\nNo, wait a minute. I can't ignore this.
Or "that's a dangerous threat." It's like\nsaying "my headache hurts!"
It's technically redundant and incorrect.\nI just can't get over that.
Okay, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nHelp me out with this mess.
What troubles me is the word "uniform."\n"Form" means shape, but what is uni-?
You're correct. It means "one" as in\n"single."
I can see why you guessed that, but\nunfortunately, it means "one."
"Uniform" literally means something that\nhas one form. So of course they match!\nNo need to say so.
No one likes the grammar police, though.
But I can't help it. I'm a teacher!
Paying attention to details like that isn't\nbad. But it sounds a bit snobby when you\npoint it out.
So try not to be a smart aleck, okay?\nBecause you probably make just as many\nmistakes without realizing.
As your English teacher, I'm one to know.\nNow, back to class.
Awareness alone doesn't fix mistakes...
Perhaps one's many desires of who they want to become are to blame.
Hold your desires close, {PLAYER_NAME},\nor you'll end up like that.
The -ing makes it function like an adjective\nhere. This is called the present participle.
Speaking of -ing... I got curious and looked\ninto the word "wedding" recently.
You'll hear it in nouns like "wedding dress"\nall the time, but it's almost never used as a\nverb, like "I'm wedding my wife today."
Instead, we use the verb "marry." Like in\nthe clich\xe9 phrase used during a proposal.
So, I looked up the etymology of "wed"\nand found it's because it was originally\nonly used in limited situations.
Let's see if you can figure out which ones.\nListen up, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nand make a guess.
What was the original meaning of "wed"?\nKeep in mind, it's not related to marriage.
How isn't that related to marriage?\nAs your teacher, I'm concerned about\nyour listening skills.
We can discuss that later, but for now...\nthe correct answer is "gamble."
Ah, very sharp. You must be an experienced\ngambler to make that connection.
But enough jokes. Congrats! You're right!
"Wed" is derived from a word meaning "wager,"\nand supposedly referred to the money to be\nspent on a bride.
I don't know if it's true, but I'd buy it.\nSome people do call marriage a gamble,\nafter all.
Or maybe that's a little too cynical...\nLet's just say it depends on the person.
In my opinion, marriage isn't the only\ngamble. Life, for example, is all about\ntaking risks.
People sacrifice themselves for the desires\nthey believe in, not knowing what awaits\nthem.
"Johnny's grandmother made the best potato\npie," is how I'd translate this part.
...This textbook is quite odd, isn't it?
In America, apple or cherry pie is much more\ncommon, but potato?
Nothing beats a nice, baked potato, though.\nAll it needs is a little butter. So simple\nand delicious!
But sometimes phrases mean more than\njust their words. I'm talking about idiomatic\nexpressions and slang.
All right, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nI know you can get this one,\njust don't be a potatohead.
What does phrase "hot potato" refer to?\nThink about the game you'd play when you\nwere younger.
That's an interesting way to look at the phrase...
But, no, the answer is "a task no one wants to do."
Aha, correct! You must do a lot of cooking!\nIt's a task no one wants to do.
Imagine a piping hot potato.
No one would want to touch it. It hurts!
You can't even peel it without burning\nyourself. That's why it's a task no one\nwants to touch.
Idioms like that can seem kind of random...
...but there's always a backstory to it. That's why I love them!
This phrase probably won't pop up on your\nentrance exams, but you can use it to impress\nnative speakers.
Imagining a task you want to pass onto\nsomeone else as throwing them a piping\nhot potato...
Hoohoo, it brings to mind a rather amusing\nscenario... Perhaps you should try it on\nthe Phantom Thieves!
The scores on the listening test were\nfantastic. Everyone did great! I'm very proud\nof you all.
Listening skills lead to speaking skills,\nso keep it up and get those ears used\nto hearing English!
Knowing the rules of pronunciation also\nhelps. Sometimes the sounds don't match\nthe letters.
"Let it go" might be slurred together when\nspoken, becoming something like "Lidigo."
I bet you listen to music in English,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nGive this question a try.
What is it called when the sounds of\ntwo words are blended together?
Right, because the words are linked together.
Hah, nice try. The real answer is linking.\nSometimes the simplest answer is correct.
That said, there are still rules when it\ncomes to merging and dropping sounds.\nIt's not just random.
But just knowing that a rule exists can make\nlistening a lot easier.
I didn't learn this until college, actually.
And when I did, I wished I'd been taught it sooner!
Don't waste all that time struggling\nlike I had to in my youth.
Listen to your elders at least this once.
I thought textbooks contained all the rules\nand answers, but I suppose they can't cover\nit all.
It feels a bit metaphorical for all of\nits truths to not all be true.
And not very kind, if you ask me.
I solved the practice\nquestions by myself...
I diligently listened\nto the lecture...
Awkward silence...
Being tortured only excites me more!
Heh heh heh...
Come to me. Become my power...
I shall follow your will, and protect all\nliving things...
I shall follow your will, and facilitate the\ngrowth of all creation...
I shall follow your will, and keep a watchful\neye over all the world...
I shall follow your will, and subjugate\nall wickedness...
Woman! Give I, the Great Cupid,\nyour power!
You there! Woman! To be my strength\nis the ultimate happiness!
Witness my power.
A fine display of power...
You have completed the Kagura Dance...\nI shall reward you.
You failed to complete the Kagura Dance\nin time. Please leave.
You have 2 turns left. Please complete\nthe dance.
You have only one turn left. Please hurry\nand complete the dance.
You did not complete the Kagura Dance as I\nasked. Please leave.
Listen well and complete the Kagura Dance.
First, please perform three different dances\nin one turn.
Listen well and complete the Kagura Dance\ntogether.
Hoom. They seem to be pleased with our\nperformance.
Oh dear! They do not seem pleased with\nour performance!
All right. It seems they are satisfied with\nour performance... But we must not let our\nguards down.
The human heart is comprised of one soul and\nfour spirits, just as all other things are.
You've stepped into my territory...\nPrepare yourselves.
So, that last strike wasn't enough... Then\nhow about this!?
I'm impressed you withstood that attack.\nI think I underestimated you.
It seems I have no choice but to use\nmy full strength...
Worthless scum! You can't even scratch me!
Looks like I'll need to go all out...
Grovel before me like the worthless trash\nyou are, scum!
I want it! Everything! It's all mine!\nHand it over!
Hoom... Wonder, a moment? Does something\nabout that Pixie seem strange to you?
Anything could happen. Be on your guard.
Learning by doing is the best approach.\nFor now, follow my lead.
It appears I spoke too soon. This one is some\nsort of Glitch amalgamation.
Hoom... It appears our attacks are having\na harder time connecting.
Worry not. There is a way forward.
The Self-Destruct Bots function just like\nCombat Drones. First, focus on collecting\nDeployment Points.
Once you have enough points, issue\nyour command.
The more Self-Destruct Bots you employ, the\ngreater the damage.
It's about to target someone!\nPrepare to cover them!
Damn! That jerk is just gonna retreat into\nthe screen again!? Can't we do anything?
You might be onto something. If only we could\nfind a way to steal it...
Whoa, for real!? If we take out more, we'll\nbe rich!
However, I can sense some sort of power from\nthat imitation money... It might be\nadvantageous to collect it after all.
That shape... It could only be an enormous\npiggy bank. How fascinating...
No way, it's gigantic! How are we supposed to\nbeat something like this!?
Hoom. Your unanimous bravery in the face of\nsuch peril is heartening.
Hmm... It likely gives us the fake cash only\nto collect it again.
Is this that "money laundering" thing?\nI don't really get it...
If we all have fake money, most of it will be\ntaken back. In short...
You catch on quick. We can use skills on our\nallies to transfer the fake money.
They seem to be filling that apparatus\nwith energy...
What!? Why did this guy come back?
The energy filling that apparatus must be\nable to heal things.
But there are limits. It's bound to run out\nsooner or later.
You're quite tenacious...\nI guess I should get serious, too.
I know your taste now.\nThose attacks won't work on me this time!
"Taste"!? A taste of what!?
Seems he has put up a barrier attuned to\nour attacks... How troublesome.
If we attack him with an attribute he\nremembers, he'll just absorb it.
Please use your power\nto put an end to my doubts...
I'm extremely grateful... I can't begin to\nexpress my thanks.
Ah... It seems my mind is still trapped\nin a state of confusion...
This heavenly maiden is my guide...\nPlease, put an end to my doubts...
If we're attacked, we'll hit 'em right back!
Hmm... Maybe we can make use of\nthat Shadow's cold air somehow.
A bad energy is coming from those scales...\nBe cautious of the balance.
Be careful with Angel and Succubus. They have\na particular set of attacks...
We should keep that fake money\nin one place instead.
This battle's difficulty has been lowered.
This animation is a work in progress.
N-Nice to meet you!
Heyo!
Hmm, inspiration might strike me today.
Ah, what a coincidence!
So, this is the statue of that famous loyal\nhound.
To steadfastly await the return of\none's master... What admirable resolve.
I'm just going in circles, dragging you around...
That's what you're thinking right now, right?
I heard that Tokyo has lots of date spots.
Wait... are you interested in that stuff?
M-maybe a little bit...
Our relationship...?
Are you seeking a different kind of relationship?
When you're with me...
All of these feelings\njust kind of bubble up.
All finished...

It's on the house.
I'll look after school.
I don't wanna...
I thought you'd provide for us.
It looks like a person...
Is it really a Shadow?
Buy
Not now
Let's investigate.
Let me think about it.
Maybe later?
Yeah, I am.
Not right now, sorry...
Let's find them.
Choice?
Guest?
My hopes for the future...
I can't say.
I'm fine being average.
Ms. Katayama?
Are you all right?
Sorry to interrupt.
You're a lifesaver.
Tell him to watch where he's going
Lend the girl a hand
Who are you?
What the heck's going on?
I have so many questions...
Hope is... lost?
What makes you say that?
Get out of here how?
Who found us?
That rings a bell...
Maybe sort of...
What are they?
What is happening right now?
That seems likely.
How is that possible!?
And thou art I!
Let's roll!
Just say when!
Who's J\xe1no\u0161\xedk?
Mementos?
What the heck are Shadows?
Let's leave ASAP.
Here?
We can't let this stand.
We'll take their desires back!
Flabber...what?
What did you say?
Work?
What are you gonna make me do?
I'd like to see her wares.
We should leave for now.
Lufel?
So that was real...?
You look different...
Why are you an owl!?
You're leaving already?
I still have so many questions...
I want to try
I'll think about it
Exchange all.
Exchange some.
Keep fishing.
View prizes.
Leave the Fishing Pond.
Beginner Pond.
Expert Pond.
Master Pond.
Back.
We should try it.
All aboard!
I'll be there.
I'm busy right now.
Special plan?
What does that mean?
All right, let's do this.
Hold up a minute.
Give me a minute.
But we just made it back.
Wouldn't that be dangerous?
Okay, let's head to the palace.
I'll think about it.
Let's go then.
Just give me a second.
I do!
I'm not interested.
They're connected.
It should give us a hint.
That's the spirit.
We'll change his heart.
I have!
Not right now.
I am!
Maybe not now.
Yeah, I collect them.
Not really.
Let's go now.
Got a new item on sale?
Sorry, we don't have the funds.
Let's check it out.
It's kinda hard to say no...
Ask away.
I'm kinda busy right now...
I've never played in a band...
But I can't play any instruments...
I'm all ears.
I've never played soccer before...
I'd probably just be a burden...
Good timing?
We can't really ignore this.
The reward could be good...
I love the atmosphere.
I just followed my feet.
Powers of observation...
Powers of transformation...
Let's see.
Cameras again...
Feels more like magic.
Feels more like sci-fi.
I agree.
I'm getting sick of this.
No need for that.
There's a camera here.
This is getting silly.
Stick to a premise!
What a sloppy performance.
He's no screenwriter...
We've got to keep going.
We'll set Miyazawa straight.
Merope?
I'm in the Velvet Room again?
Warning?
What is this about?
Potential?
What are you saying?
Ruin?
Is that some kind of joke?
What kind of interaction?
Good morning...
What are you doing here?
My what?
What's a crumb festival?
Business partners?
What's the deal with this job?
Our what now?
You plan to move in here?
Uh, yeah...
Sorry, ma'am, who are you?
Nicely spotted.
Glad you're all right.
Are you looking for this?
You dropped this.
Don't worry about it.
It all happened so fast.
That's right.
Nope.
Mango.
Banana.
Apple.
Scary?
Menace?
Condemned?
Divine Justice?
Magatsukami?
They report on troublemakers?
Why not just call the police?
My name's {PLAYER_NAME}.
Call me {NAME1}.
Playing what?
I don't think that's it.
It's probably thanks to you.
Please, go ahead.
That's why I'm here.
A cognitive realm...?
What does cognitive mean?
Their desires were stolen?
It was taken from them.
Another self?
You mean like my...
How can that be?
I can't believe it.
Job?
The thing you mentioned yesterday?
This is all too much, too fast.
I didn't agree to this.
Don't fly off after that bombshell!
No, it's my bad.
What'd you say?
Thanks again for your help.
Target?
What's he doing?
Did he do that on purpose?
How pathetic.
Despicable.
It's because of his Shadow.
His Shadow's gone out of control.
Let's stop him right now.
Maybe we can reason with him.
He's after her!
I can't stand by and do nothing!
Lufel, did you see that?
So what are our options?
Is there nothing we can do?
Precious item?
Steal?
Now I'm not so sure.
What's your endgame here?
What's your stake in all this?
I'll try to do what I can.
I need more time to think.
Metaverse Navigator?
The where and the what now?
Code names?
Why?
Who's Deborah?
Run that by me one more time.
"Wonder?"
Got any other ideas?
"Cattle?"
What's that supposed to mean?
Should we withdraw?
We should run right now!
Decision?
Cognitive forms?
They aren't real?
I... may've met them before.
I have no memory of them.
Duo?
Oh, thank you.
You're so well prepared.
So that guy from earlier was...
So the guy in black who saved us...
Just like an idol duo...
And they have code names too...
...Cattle?
Why are you a car!?
I've never driven before.
I don't have my license.
It's a Phantom Idol.
They're on our side.
Phantom Idol.
That's not it.
Intelligence?
Who told you that?
Palace?
Should we bust it open?
Think there's another entrance?
Good idea.
You gonna fly on over there?
Workbench?
What do we need that for?
I need a workbench.
Trying to find a workbench.
Never.
Maybe...
It's probably in your head.
I'm looking for a workbench.
Do you sell workbenches?
It's free?
Are you sure?
I was just hanging in Yongen-Jaya.
I stopped by the secondhand shop.
Sounds like you guys are close.
Known each other a long time?
Cared more about the other person?
Blamed herself for it?
That's a great dream.
I'm rooting for you.
You heading home any time soon?
How long do you plan on staying?
Base?
You can't just decide that.
What kinda logic is that?
I remember.
Sort of.
Hindering someone's desires...
What are you trying to say?
What do you mean "us"?
You're coming with me?
Let's let them handle it.
We shouldn't get in the way.
We didn't talk.
Thank goodness.
I'm glad she's okay.
We're business partners.
We live together.
Not entirely.
I feel bad for her.
Nothing in particular.
Uh, Lufel?
Is something funny?
He won't get away with this.
Let's stop him once and for all.
That's some real initiative!
She's got some fight in her.
Stay away from her.
But what about her?
I can't leave her like this.
Robbing what exactly?
What's this "Treasure" you mentioned?
It's just you.
How could you tell?
It was all right.
What does it mean?
Did you figure something out?
Stealing?
So that's the job?
An item?
The root cause?
Wait, we're not gonna steal it?
So we just wanna find it?
If that's what you desire.
That depends on you.
I have no idea.
Do you know what happened?
Is there something inside?
You mentioned resting...
How do you know that?
This room feels different somehow...
My passion for life?
Infinite possibilities?
Bonds?
Strengthening my heart?
Calm down.
Yeah, it's me.
I go by Wonder here.
You don't look too good.
A slump?
You didn't do anything wrong.
You don't look well.
Are you sure you're okay?
Arai-san?
Snap out of it!
You're alive!
That's his Shadow?
He looks totally different!
Stop!
Quit it!
Let her go!
You're wrong.
It's not her fault.
You ruined it yourself.
You threw your own life away.
You don't have to give up!
You have to follow your heart!
Let your fury fly!
Since before the battle.
You just noticed now?
Let's hurry.
What's on your mind?
But in the Metaverse...
His Shadow was...
Welcome to the team!
Could you sit down please?
Central Street, right?
Where are we going?
We have our reasons.
We have a fight coming.
Let's give 110%.
Nah, not really.
Let's not try too hard.
I'll have to think it over.
Not sure yet.
Stop exaggerating...
Oh boy...
So what should I do?
Thanks to my parents.
I guess a little.
Part-time job?
What kind of job?
Work is for chumps.
I feel empowered.
That's an overstatement.
How should I spend my paycheck?
Where did the Shadow go?
I lost sight of the Shadow...
Peculiar?
What kind of Shadow is it?
You look sleepy.
Maurice Leblanc.
Juraj J\xe1no\u0161\xedk.
Ryoma Sakamoto.
The library?
Do you like books?
Feels pretty good.
We're too young to drink.
A place for myself?
What do you mean by that?
Fusion?
What are you gonna do?
I went through this blue door...
There was this guy with a long nose...
Sounds like amnesia.
Wow, that's nuts.
Let's do this.
She's exactly right.
We believe in you.
You are a little cheeky though.
What a total creep.
But she's okay now.
We don't need to watch it.
Let's keep moving.
Sounds like you had a crush on him.
You liked him a lot, huh?
It's not your fault.
Let's do it!
That's the spirit!
Materialized?
What should we do?
Should we send a calling card?
How about a letter?
We should consider this carefully.
I want to think it over some more.
Let's not.
I'm not sure.
We should bring her something too.
No problem.
For Noge!
He's going to pay.
Let's make a show of it.
We'll make sure everyone sees.
Let's send the calling card.
I need more time to prepare.
It's time to change Kiuchi's heart!
Cross that bridge when we get there.
Blaming others again?
You brought it on yourself.
You ready, Closer?
Let's take that Treasure!
The Treasure's ours.
Shove it in!
We have to take it with us.
You did great today, Motoha.
What you said back there was cool.
That took guts.
That's the least he can do.
Influence on hope?
We what?
Did I say that?
Spill it, feathers.
Meh, later's fine.
There are still six left.
There are more Palace rulers?
Sure you don't mind?
With roasted pork.
Rice and extra noodles.
Plain.
Eating dinner will cause disaster?
The heck kind of aura is that?
This is more than enough.
Thanks for dinner.
Recover all seven Treasures?
Take on another six Palaces?
What's wrong with it?
Do you not like it?
Hiromu Miyazawa?
Some acquaintance of yours?
I'm {PLAYER_NAME}.
Don't mind me.
What're you implying?
It isn't your fault.
My home is your home.
I'm just getting in the door.
It's about Kiuchi's arrest.
Let's give it a shot.
If it means saving people, I'm in.
Thanks, Mom.
Don't worry, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Yup, same as always.
What clinic?
No idea.
Strong medicine?
That's some shady clinic.
I should be thanking you.
Of course I said yes.
I'm counting on you.
Sit?
We're friends.
We're a team.
Curious about her?
Don't tell me... you like Motoha?
I overdid it with stretching...
Kano broke me...
Your keen sense of taste.
He used to work at Victory Kitchen.
Save the tears for when you see her.
I'll say hi to her next time too.
I got it.
I'll try.
My body feels lethargic.
I've been having nightmares.
I've lost the will to do anything.
I was hoping for something else...
Do you have anything stronger?
Are they true?
That'd be a big help.
I take full responsibility.
Finished up at the clinic.
We have the drugs.
In Shinjuku?
On the way to Victory Kitchen?
It's certainly intriguing.
If you say so...
What area?
What's ahead?
After we changed Kiuchi's heart...
Why're we the nuisance?
Guess we just have to do it.
It'll be a long road ahead.
I thought you didn't like it?
What about the soup problem?
What are you trying to tell us?
Okay, we won't go then.
More like starving!
I'm not that hungry yet.
What are you up to?
Me too.
That was delicious.
It makes me want seconds.
I could eat it every day.
Give Yamagoshi-san our best.
We'll see you at school.
What a fraud.
Why don't you expose him?
Kano's blaming himself?
Why would he do that?
Are you feeling okay?
You haven't done anything wrong.
He's to blame, not you.
You're really brave, Tomoko.
It's all thanks to Motoha.
You can't just do that!
Shut your mouth!
That game's rigged.
There's no way to win that.
He's a dishonest man.
We can't trust him.
We can't let him take anything else.
Let's expose his evil deeds.
I doubt it...
Sounds delicious.
It's like a film studio.
Maybe someone's filming something?
It's about the Food Fight.
Miyazawa's setting him up.
I do.
Sometimes I wonder...
I guess we'll find out.
What "ruin" are you talking about?
I don't understand.
Increase?
Who are you talking about?
Let's go meet him now.
We can do it later.
Seen him on the rooftop before.
My guess? Instant ramen, rooftop.
I have to talk to you.
The Food Fight is a trap.
Are you avoiding people?
Why are you doing all this?
Something you're not telling me?
That's a nice story.
Yamagoshi-san's a great guy.
Serves him right.
That's not great.
I would've done the same.
No it isn't.
It's Miyazawa's fault.
What did Ms. Katayama do?
Why was that necessary?
I heard.
Yeah, I saw the news.
Did someone message you?
Yeah, we talked.
He told me about his past.
Kano's planning to fight.
We have to save Kano.
What's "the soul of Victory Kitchen"?
Tell us "the soul of Victory Kitchen".
Leave it to us.
We'll save Shun no matter what.
Risky move?
What are we gonna do?
Let's head to Shinjuku.
I need a bit longer.
What happened at the Food Fight!?
Where's Kano!?
Help us open the safe!
We need the soul of Victory Kitchen!
We have to get it to Shun!
Shun needs it to win!
Kano wins!
Game, set, match!
What are you saying!?
There's no other choice!
You shall call me Wonder here.
We entered the Metaverse.
This is a world outside of reality.
It wasn't me either.
Then who was it?
Come with us.
Just trust us.
Run, Kano!
Quick, get out of here!
Shut up, Miyazawa!
This is your fault, Miyazawa!
No, it's not.
We chose to help you!
You didn't drag us into anything!
Do you think they'd abandon that?
So what are you gonna do?
Have you found your resolve?
Show him what a real chef is!
Right behind you!
Let's never look back!
He's an owl.
He's a hooded ghost.
Don't sweat it.
No need to apologize.
Let's roll.
Back to school it is.
Let's get going.
We can go into detail later.
We promise.
We changed Kiuchi's heart.
Of course we can.
That's up to you.
How... unique.
I can't call you that...
Soy it is.
Welcome to the team, Soy.
His pen is a sword or something.
He has a katana tongue.
We have to make it materialize.
The real work starts now.
Outside your area?
Overthinking?
I'm in too.
Let's take back everything he's stolen.
You got this, Shun.
That's a great idea!
Sure, let's do this.
Not yet...
Let's change Miyazawa's heart!
Let's give it everything we got!
Let's snatch it up.
Time to take the Treasure.
Show him the pride of a true chef!
We're taking your Treasure.
Hand it over!
Soy's got this.
It's up to you!
We'll take it off your hands.
It's ours now.
Irritated...?
Well done, Soy.
Good work.
Two down.
Five to go.
Wrong?
What did you remember?
I'm fine...
Like someone's manipulating them?
You mean, intentionally...?
A mastermind?
Someone's manipulating him?
That's the Treasure.
Miyazawa's film reel transformed.
We'll have to be careful here too...
If they find out who we are...
Just keep acting natural.
As long as we're careful...
You're right.
Haven't we been planning already...?
How about Motoha?
How about Shun?
Can't you do it?
That leaves me.
I guess I'll have to.
We did great work together.
Couldn't have done it without you.
Sure is fun though.
Feels like we've all gotten close.
Hideout?
Sounds cool.
Yes, please.
I'll pass.
Okay, just a little.
Special lectures?
Class observations?
Cafeteria duty?
That was surprising.
You can't blame her.
It may have a deeper meaning.
Did they draw it wrong?
I don't get it.
I know this Shadow!
Is this the one from before!?
We won't.
We'll search the real world.
What power?
You mean my Personas?
The key to salvation?
The source of ruin?
There are others?
Who do you mean?
Is your health okay?
You must be excited.
I'd love one.
No, I don't.
There's no time to get one.
You have your own driver?
You sure are rich...
My name's not worth knowing.
You've known each other that long?
Educational reform?
Improving the school environment?
Who cares.
"Extreme Garlic"?
"Super Spicy Habanero"?
I think she's in the right.
Violence solves nothing.
I'm worried.
...can't be ruled out.
..is still nonexistent.
Why Tanemura-senpai?
Why not a teacher?
Let's make a complaint.
You got us.
You're mistaken.
We went out for burgers.
Have faith in us.
Trust us.
Let's head for the Palace.
We have to see it for ourselves.
That's why we heard water.
It's really big.
Isn't she important to you?
I thought you liked her.
She teaches class 2C, so 23?
Add the letters in Kumi to get 54?
Input 5423
Input 2354
Strategic retreat!
Cattle, Vanish Ball!
Absorbing energy?
Is that even possible?
It sounded like Mr. Akashi.
It threatened to consult us to death.
Thank you so much.
I wonder if I can eat all that.
Roast pork AND stewed eggs please.
Sorry for bringing him.
I can't picture it.
More ramen please!
Perhaps...
Perhaps not...
Why investigate him?
Work together how?
Well, we do want information.
We'll at least hear you out.
You didn't know?
Is it really that famous?
It really does.
It's very beautiful.
Anyone could pull off that outfit.
Used against her?
She's being manipulated?
He set her up.
Akashi planned all of this.
Why discuss this with us?
What's your goal here?
We accept.
We have no other options.
Did you find something?
Is there proof in there?
She was fantastic.
I could never pull that off.
Is he a stalker?
Is he obsessed with her?
You can trust us.
Uhhh, sure...
I'm going home too.
I might stop somewhere.
It's Metaverse time.
Not yet.
I feel like it was 6...
My money's on 7.
Why are you here!?
How are you here!?
More or less...
My name is Wonder.
We're pressing on.
No way out but through.
Exploited?
It sure was.
Plus other footage too.
To think she felt this way...
Or we can go back.
Why not turn around?
Stay on your toes.
Two rulers!?
Wait, does that mean...
Don't give up!
Enough already!
Stop hurting her!
Can you handle this?
Cover us!
Haste makes waste.
We can't be reckless.
Want a piggyback ride?
I'll carry you in my arms.
"Fully" awakened?
What about her desire?
Y-Yeah.
You're at fault too, Lufel.
No comment.
Something feels off.
What do you want?
Fumbling over time.
Exerting my influence.
How do you know about that?
Do you know who it is?
Scheme?
He intended to make a Joint Palace?
Creates villains?
Finds scapegoats?
Succeeds at others' expense?
I've seen the Hit-and-Run Rider...
When did she start doing it?
Me too...
My career questionnaire...
So that's how it works?
That monster.
He's stealing her desires.
Let's change her heart.
Akashi's schemes end here.
You think of everything...
Dependable as always.
We'll be waiting for you.
No playing hooky.
Welcome aboard.
True...
How about "Wink"?
It does suit her.
Welcome, Wind.
We're counting on you.
The Treasure!?
Why can we see it?
I'll cut off the power.
I'll cut the cable.
Okay, we're counting on you.
We'll buy you some time!
Aim for the eyes!
We'll save her for sure this time!
Come back to school, Sensei.
Because Sensei is gone?
Because there's no energy source.
I hate to say it, but that's right.
We need to leave ASAP.
Exactly.
That's why we're Phantom Thieves.
An idea?
We didn't change Akashi's heart.
We couldn't steal Sensei's Treasure.
Fine...
But I need to prepare.
Need to prepare first.
Go listen
Listen another time
Are you Ayaka Sakai?
Sorry, can I ask your name?
What's the paper for?
Are you doing a show?
You must like music a lot.
I wanted to hear you.
What were you gonna play?
Sure thing.
I want to hear you next time.
Sure.
Now's not a good time...
Don't give up so easily.
I want to hear more.
You okay?
You don't look so good.
Your health is more important.
There's always tomorrow.
Something wrong?
Did you sleep last night?
Why did she walk away?
Creative differences?
There's no rush.
I'm happy to help anytime.
I'll find you a place to play.
All right, another time then.
I might know a place...
I want to hear your song.
You can practice here.
Your voice is beautiful.
Were you nervous?
It didn't sound like your first.
You've never performed live?
What would help you to sing?
Is there anything I can do?
Let's think of something else.
Try to loosen up...
Booyah!
Ready, set, go!
Here... we... GO!
I know you can.
I'm looking forward to it!
Can you play somewhere else?
Sorry, I won't be in the area...
I have a trick up my sleeve...
Guess what I brought.
I borrowed it from school.
Let's jam!
Is this good?
I'll set the rhythm.
It was a good song.
You really did!
I want to hear another too.
What's the next song?
What are you waiting for?
Play it next time you busk!
Stop by another time
You sounded good.
You did great on your own!
Your message.
A catchy melody.
Both are important.
What do you want to say most?
Just keep trying stuff out.
Who are your songs for?
Say something
Just let her be
Not feeling well?
Is that all you want to say to her?
What do you want to do?
Can I request a song?
Teach me to play guitar!
You got me.
Dunno what you mean...
I wanna hear you play at your best.
You must be imagining things.
I just want to cheer you up.
You're welcome.
It was just a coincidence.
I'm glad we met.
I support you as a fan.
I feel the same way you do.
Say hi another time
Congrats!
I wanna hear!
It's a wonderful song.
Have you picked a title?
It didn't sound rough to me.
What are you planning to add?
I'll help rearrange it, then.
Want to add a bass part?
We could go to Shimo-Kitazawa...
I'll ask our advisor.
It's really coming together.
Can't wait to hear it live.
I'll go get my bass.
I need a bass.
You can count on me.
I'm not so sure...
Ready when you are.
Let's count down.
Go ahead.
I'm sure she'll understand.
I look forward to it.
Do you need help?
That's fine.
Let me rethink this.
I'm in.
How about the Ferris wheel?
Give the roller coaster a go!
Breaks are important.
Would you prefer to be alone?
Can't beat golden age movies.
I prefer modern flicks.
It's a wonderful place.
I think it's a great spot.
Thanks for inviting me.
I'm kinda hungry...
I already made plans...
You could come to mine.
How about your place?
Make yourself at home.
Are you nervous?
Feel free to stay the night.
Let's play till dark.
I can't...
I have.
I'll show you around.
Let's hang out together.
We can meet every day!
Let's get going!
That's too bad.
I can wait.
I'll go with you next time.
I can watch out for you.
Why'd you want to go there?
Do you like stars?
Star-shaped ice cubes.
Colors like the night sky.
Anytime.
I'm honored.
I'd love to do this again.
Leave the rest to me.
Tag me in.
I'm your monja mentor.
Nothing but the best for you.
Sure, come over anytime.
It's a bit soon for that...
Is it mocktail time?
Would that idea have been so wrong?
Was that really all you wanted?
Keep watching
Leave her be
It's just a little water.
Achoo!
{PLAYER_NAME}.
The name's {PLAYER_NAME}.
So about earlier...
What's with the bottle-throwing?
Can I drink this...?
You know I'm a minor, right?
It's sweet! I like this!
It's like soda, but not quite.
It's a little bitter.
It was cool.
It was like you were dancing.
I was on the edge of my seat.
Can I come here again?
Is this place open to minors?
I could do with a drink.
I have plans today...
The colors are so beautiful.
Looks delicious.
Can I take a picture?
Why'd you become a bartender?
When'd you start training?
It's a great story.
Your dream came true.
Watch
Not today
She's captivating.
You've got some great moves.
It's like watching a dancer.
Such light footwork.
The outfit is beautiful.
You look like a pro.
Give her a hand
Need some help?
I'll carry some.
A little, yeah.
It was light as a feather.
Just tea?
Peach tea's a mocktail?
Join in and watch
Those are some moves!
That recipe you taught me...
Making mocktails is fun.
It was good.
It was pretty tough.
I nailed it.
Here you are.
Yeah, jasmine tea.
I used something more relaxing.
Just like you taught me.
I was worried about you.
I wanted you to relax.
Your dance club?
The one from college?
Shiina-san...
What were you looking at?
Something on your mind?
You could win this.
You don't want to go?
It sounds cool.
Feeling nervous?
You have the skills for it.
Thanks for telling me all that.
Sorry to dredge that up.
It wasn't your fault.
Anything new on the menu?
Stop yelling.
Get back, Shiina-san.
Is this guy drunk?
Door's right over there.
Do I need to call the cops?
That guy's a pain.
What's his name?
Tell me about him.
I want to look into him.
I can't let this slide.
Time for a change of heart!
Let's do this for Shiina-san!
Shiina-san didn't want your help.
Sounds like white-knighting to me.
I came to see how you were doing.
I can't wait to try it!
I didn't.
Just a little.
I'd risk it for you.
You're important to me too.
I respect your skills.
Age is just a number.
I think you're great.
I'll look after you.
I can't leave you alone...
Why'd you drink so much?
Did you have a lot?
That's true.
But still...
You don't need to thank me.
I haven't done a thing.
I'll make you a mocktail.
Wait there.
You're not beating me.
You're doing plenty.
I still have a ways to go.
Yeah, you're beet red.
I get to see a new side of you.
I've got time to spare.
You tried, though!
Did you have fun?
You'll get 'em next time.
Time to blossom!
I wish I could drink it forever.
I already want more.
Whatever you need.
Of course it is.
I can't wait.
Glad you're having fun.
What about the wrath of god?
Should we hold hands?
This place gives me the creeps.
It's really not that dangerous.
What about the attractions?
Let's ride the rollercoaster first.
You're a genius!
I'm hungry...
I have high hopes for this.
You get what you pay for.
I buy it from the school store.
Depends on the day.
I don't eat lunch.
Let me treat you this time.
You sure you have enough?
Clothes.
Character shops.
A traditional rice cracker.
A social media-worthy fruit tea.
It's worth a try.
Food is art!
What kind of agreement?
What are you planning?
An idol?
Where'd that come from?
College or work?
Never thought about it.
A reasonable degree of happiness.
What happened?
Idols again?
Not even once.
So do you just like idols then?
That makes sense I guess.
You seem very eager about this.
Do I have to?
Absolutely not.
Care to explain?
On-site?
Why are we here?
Again with the idols...
They ran away.
You really want a photo, huh?
Let's calm down.
You're scaring her.
Miss, your time's up.
You sure that's all?
You just wanted to hang out more.
That's called being a fan.
Guess you're her fan now.
You just want to go.
Fine, I'll tag along.
Promise?
You mean the concept caf\xe9?
Explain.
What's with the intro?
Will somebody please explain!?
That's deep.
What's the point?
You just want to order more.
I am a little curious.
What promise?
You mean the photo session?
Sounds complicated.
Let's do our best.
You take the lead.
Watch your time carefully.
Don't get kicked out.
She has lots of tickets.
She has plenty of time left.
Land of idols?
Our Naruru awaits.
I had no idea.
That's rough.
You're so strong.
Sounds illegal.
Can you sue?
Why her?
Naruru might quit?
We'll make that villain pay.
Let's help Naruru!
We won't let you!
We're going to save Naruru!
You exploited their dreams.
Was that really your goal?
It's not too late.
You can still make things right.
Great to hear things worked out.
I'm glad you feel better, Naruru.
I'm excited too.
I'm with you all the way.
If I have to.
Please do.
Watch me nail this.
A lot has happened.
This is surreal...
All hail Naruru.
You'll cheer me on?
Isn't Naruru your fave?
No thanks.
Not sure.
Maybe...?
You mean hold hands?
That's too early for us.
To get lost in a story.
To view a world outside reality.
That's a little melodramatic.
I never thought of it that way.
I want to enjoy my youth.
You know, the usual.
I'll keep that in mind.
I only read manga.
Total bookworm.
Did you buy them here?
Don't tell me you're a regular...
My heart's racing.
Only with the right person.
Sleeping, pretty much.
It's hard to relax there.
I can have some me time here.
Entertain...?
Oh, it's no biggie.
That was... something.
Maybe use some more emotion?
I-I'll have a water...
What else do you have?
Merope!!!
Do I have to say...?
I think I get how you feel.
It seemed... genuine.
Photoshoot...?
Not this again...
You're still kinda flat.
I guess old habits die hard...
Pose?
H-How's this?
Way ahead of you!
We should've really taken one.
Yeah, I've got time.
I'm busy...
With you?
Okay then.
If that's the case...
What'd you do for baseball?
What'd you do with Tomoko?
That's sweet.
Lots of good memories there, huh?
Did you hit any home runs?
Aren't you going inside?
I'd love to.
I'm kinda busy...
You got it.
Earth to Motoha.
It won't.
It'll be okay.
Take your time.
Sounds like a plan.
Maybe when I'm less busy...
What are we doing here?
What's the plan, Stan?
1 pound.
10 pounds.
200 pounds.
I can keep going.
I'm burnt out.
You can count on it.
Let's lift 200 lbs together.
It's a date.
Not right now...
To Inokashira Park?
To the batting cages?
To Chinatown?
Why are we at the diner?
We taking a break?
Your coach is here for you.
I've got my eye on you.
It's true.
Aren't you eating too much?
Let's work hard together.
How could I refuse?
I'm sorry, I can't...
Give it your all!
No slacking off now!
Go for a home run!
Do you know her?
Her supervisor.
Her friend.
Her boyfriend.
She's right.
You can win.
As long as you train...
You're an ace all-rounder.
Let's give it a swing.
Sorry, got other plans...
I got your back.
Let's hit it!
Don't bother her.
Why are you obsessed with her?
You wanna beat her that bad?
And what about how Motoha feels?
You're being selfish.
I want to help her.
On a whim.
She's my friend.
I brought snacks!
Maybe next time...
You are not a wreck.
Don't overdo it.
As your coach, I disagree.
Taking breaks is important too.
Order whatever you like.
It's your cheat day.
You said cheat days are important.
Depriving yourself's worse for you.
What do you truly want out of this?
Why did you start exercising?
Do you hate baseball?
Do you want to continue baseball?
Are the Phantom Thieves important?
Well said.
I'm glad I asked.
Explain that to Tamayo.
Coach approves.
Because we're a team.
Because you're important to me.
Exactly what it sounds like.
Hmmm, I wonder...
Go with her
Decline
You've got this.
No.
Motoha chose this herself.
You did your best.
That was so cool.
No regrets?
You've already thanked me.
You took the words outta my mouth.
Of course I will.
Not now.
You running sets here?
Must require a lot of stamina.
Squats.
Sit-ups.
Wall sits.
Chocolate.
Fruit Blend.
Custard.
I challenge you!
A topping or two can't hurt.
How about cheese instead?
Wanna watch it at my place?
Sorry, I'm busy right now.
Nuh-uh.
You sure you don't mean you?
It's OK, I'll be there too.
You could always grab my arm.
Can I help you...?
Have we met?
How'd you guess?
Not really, no.
Why would that be?
Threats?
Haunting?
I've gotta go...
I agree completely.
Determining their cause?
Not really...
I'm pretty busy actually!
Within reason.
I'm ready!
Whose corpse?
Arise...?
Could you let me go now?
You planning to stay like that?
You're stronger than I thought.
Should we dig into it?
Feel free to go after him.
I will!
Today's not good for me.
Lament?
The truth will be revealed!
You scared?
You're hurting my arm.
I won't abandon you.
Okay, bye then!
I have plans today.
Assassin's Juice?
Sounds dangerous.
Mysterious.
So it's just a popular juice?
Someone you know?
So that box was...
Why is he doing this?
Is it okay to let him go?
What now?
New problem?
Operation X?
Launch?
Ready, willing, and able.
I can't now.
A theory?
Tell me about it.
Watch my back.
Let's stop them.
I saw.
You really gave it your all.
Count me in.
My thoughts exactly.
Speak for yourself.
It might be a trap!
You just wanna try the dessert.
Play
That's sudden.
That's nice.
I want to make a farm.
Maybe grow something?
I'm too hungry to think straight.
Log in
I can help.
What's the other reason?
Tell me more.
So this is today's investigation?
We came here just for that?
You seem nervous today.
I understand.
Isn't this rude to the girl?
This case is unusually complex.
First, calm down.
We have to find a way out.
Something's fishy about this.
I'll help you.
I can't today.
We understand.
They're taking advantage of you.
I don't think that will work.
I guess.
It's not our call to make.
Let him do what he wants.
That was harsh.
He's had a lot on his mind.
Did he strike a nerve?
Let's talk.
Today isn't good for me.
You were pretty forceful with me.
Hence the kindred spirit thing?
That explains things.
That's not true.
So we're giving up?
Take's a whole nother issue.
I'll help.
It's because I'm his friend.
It's because I'm on his side.
It's because we're kindred spirits.
Let's hear it.
Tell me another time.
Hopefully it stays that way.
So no one's gonna lock us up again?
What have you learned?
So what is friendship, really?
All thanks to Take.
Looks great.
I think that's enough plowing.
Let's till the whole world!
Something tasty.
Something filling.
Something easy to grow.
I like it.
It's embarrassing.
I wanna be a more luxurious potato.
Log on
Next time
You have experience with plants?
That's all we have to do?
Don't worry about the past.
Did you have some kind of argument?
Do you want to apologize?
Let's talk a lot from now on.
If you want someone to talk to...
You sure you're fine with me?
Sign in
That looks fun.
Is that a bazooka?
French fries.
Meat and potatoes.
Baked potato.
So... you're the friend?
She's you in real life?
Invite
Yui-san?
Are you a french fry fan?
I'm Russet.
Nice to meet you.
An office worker?
How's Yui?
Sounds tough.
Give my regards to Yui.
Thanks for the burger.
Don't
Working hard?
Pumping up the potatoes?
Do they need more water?
Is it the wrong fertilizer?
Is it pests?
We can fix this.
Don't get discouraged.
Go online
Hold off for now
Long time no see.
How have you been?
Asked other farmers.
Gathered info in town.
I wanted to make you happy.
Let's work on it together.
I dunno about every day...
We might have trouble again.
Join the game
Maybe another time
Seems fun.
What were you doing?
Where'd you get a helicopter?
Makes sense.
I don't think that's...
Classic Yui.
Will that be enough?
Insects, huh...
Head to Shibuya
If you think I can help.
Get something low effort.
Take sunlight into account.
Pick something that speaks to you.
Do your best.
You're not worried about bugs?
Go
For what?
I heard an explosion.
You've worked really hard.
I just gave you a push.
Call me Yukon Gold from now on.
Gladly.
If I must.
I want to change my outfit.
What would you recommend?
We can give it a shot.
Sorry, not my kind of thing.
Ride a snowmobile.
Winter sports.
Let's build a snow fort!
Wanna buy some?
They look hard to grow.
It's huge.
Is this really for beginners?
Full steam ahead!
We're working for free?
Too busy with farming...
There's some decorative plants...
Are you going to live here?
Do I get a say in this?
Leave
Sure, I'll go with you.
Sorry, I've got plans...
Maybe something more subdued?
Why not pair it with this?
Glad I could help.
I haven't done anything.
I know you'll find your confidence.
Wish we could help.
Is there anything we can do?
Let's go help her!
This might be the job for you.
Is your shoulder all right?
A childhood dream come true!
Let's help her out.
Can we even do it?
We're florists, we'll get it done.
Of course we did.
Her smile said it all.
You were a fabulous florist.
That's major progress!
Aw, without me?
What's the special today?
We just ended our shifts.
What can I get for you?
We just want to hang out.
Quitting that easy, fettuccine?
We've worked up an appetite.
You need a distraction.
What do you wanna do, Tomoko?
Can I have your number?
Sure, I'm free.
We should hang out more.
It is?
Glad it's a nice day.
Sounds great!
Oh, we couldn't.
Let's get the lobster then.
What's stopping your comeback then?
Until you get your strength back.
I'll stay with you forever, Tomoko.
I want to be together forever.
You're irreplaceable to me.
What did you want to talk about?
You shouldn't slack off.
Some people are just awful.
I hope that gave her some comfort.
You've done your research.
How did you manage?
You'd know better than me.
Maybe use a microphone?
I'm right behind you.
Just don't push yourself.
No spoilers.
You'll see soon enough.
Head for the rink!
Settle down first.
Can I have your autograph?
I'm still a bit worried.
Yeah, I'm free.
I'm a little busy right now...
I don't mind, but are you sure?
You're anxious about it?
Has your injury healed?
You owe me one.
I could use the money.
You can do it!
I'm a little worried...
Knock those cr\xeapes out of the park!
I'll help you out.
It'd be my pleasure.
Let's chase them out of here.
Maybe call the cops...?
Aren't there security cameras?
You might be right.
You've got a keen eye.
Good job.
How is that exactly?
Nice pitching.
I'll spend time with you.
That'll be 1,024 yen, ma'am.
Other customers are waiting, ma'am.
You've got another customer.
Want to take a break?
Do you know her too?
She was pretty.
You did good work today.
You'll get stronger, for sure.
Don't push yourself too hard.
I'm happy to help you train.
You've worked here before?
Were you a regular here?
Why not suggest it to the manager?
Put together a plan first.
It's worth a shot.
Injury?
You a fan, Tomoko?
Could you fill me in here?
{PLAYER_NAME} at your service.
I'm sure she's fine.
You're so kind, Tomoko.
Wanna come to my place?
Nothing comes to mind.
We're the only ones here, you know.
Actually, my parents are on a trip.
Fine by me.
Today's kinda busy, actually.
Let's make her a wonderful bouquet.
It's the thought that counts.
Just the two of us is kinda...
I feel bad for putting you out...
Well, if you insist!
Seriously, don't sweat it.
Hey, it's fine.
You're amazing for doing this.
Volunteering? On top of work?
I can help you out.
Having some trouble?
Sometimes, I guess?
Just today.
Beats me.
I mean, maybe?
Thanks, but no thanks.
If you'd like.
Sorry, can't...
Why is that?
That's no good.
Who needs to study?
That sounds tough.
I don't know about funny...
That's just the way it goes.
Try a bunch of things.
That's a toughie.
Can't you just take things easy?
I'd be happy to help.
Guess I have to.
That's a lot for me to handle.
I'm exhausted too.
Let's pace ourselves.
Was it spicy enough for you?
I can barely feel my tongue...
You may be right.
What about you?
Their passions lie elsewhere.
I'm sure he had his reasons.
For you to learn something?
Let's think it over together.
I'm free.
Sorry, got places to be.
Freedom in fashion.
Style has no limits.
Clothing expresses the soul.
That's a new one...
You really want to know?
Let's roll the dice.
Isn't it kinda... red?
Don't tell me it's spicy.
Is this taco-flavored?
Just do your best, Yaoling.
Take things at your own pace.
Gotta stop and smell the roses.
No, sorry...
Fuji who?
Your neighbor?
The girl we passed by before?
We've got to help somehow.
Her family is her business.
I don't get what's going on.
Let's invite her out next time.
Let's talk to her.
Pleasure to meet you.
I think we've met.
Yaoling here is my disciple.
You sure about that?
She can't be right all the time.
Something's not right here.
Sounds like a great opportunity.
We have much more to talk about!
I'm sure it'll be enlightening.
You betcha.
Sorry, I can't today.
That's a relief.
I was a bit nervous about that.
I was looking forward to that...
You're a matcha expert too?
That's some appetite.
A lady of refined tastes.
You should talk to her.
Say what's on your mind.
Go on, ask her.
I get what you're saying.
I think I understand.
Sounds good to me.
I actually have plans today...
Sit down for tea again.
Let's think things through calmly.
Time for a reconciliation ritual.
Hit her with the truth!
Choose your words carefully.
You have to say what you feel.
You're raring to go.
You mean making up, right?
I made a promise.
You're special to me, Yaoling.
Today's a bit tight.
Sorry, maybe another time?
Say what needs to be said.
You have to explain yourself.
Hit her with your feelings!
I know you did.
Can't say for sure.
Let's have faith.
I'm actually in a hurry...
Your feelings got through!
Your efforts were all worth it!
Talk about a turnabout!
That's the best kind of answer.
Aren't you overthinking it?
Your dad's one smart cookie.
Sounds fun.
I'm kinda busy.
Sure, my treat.
Your treat!
That's what caught your eye?
Always thinking about food...
I know the rumor.
First I've heard of it.
You really think so?
Wanna ride the aqua bus?
How about the aquarium?
Now's not a great time...
It's beautiful...
It's fascinating...
You bet.
Where did that come from?
So, what did you wanna talk about?
Why me?
Why not someone else?
I dunno...
I'll get supersized everything.
I guess if you're paying...
I guess I am hungry.
We're getting monjayaki?
No ramen today?
I came here the other day.
Great analysis.
Is it ramen time yet?
Want more monjayaki?
Your obsession with the broth.
Sticking to the basics.
I could eat.
I can't make it today.
I mean, if it tastes good...
Better than waiting in line.
Ashamed?
Was it the chili paste?
This is only the beginning.
You've grown so much.
Is that a bad thing?
I am pretty hungry .
I've got plans today.
Curry and ramen, huh...
I've never seen this before.
Can we finish all this?
How to what?
You're really psyched up, huh?
Probably?
No, I don't mind.
Seems like you care about her.
What did you learn?
Quit being cryptic...
Is this a big deal?
Is she someone important?
What do YOU want to do?
Don't ask me...
That reward might be nice.
Depends on how it tastes.
Going for the weirdest entry?
It's delicious, but...
Nice eat-and-walk-ability, but...
The appearance.
Your target customers.
Is it on-theme?
I'm busy now, sorry...
Did that give you any ideas?
So it did look a bit much...
Why do you ask?
He's been buying.
She swayed you just like that?
Now you're talking.
Then let's take a break.
Heritage Kitchen?
Heritage Kitchen, duh.
Fried rice sounds good.
I guess I'll have the same.
Really? Not ramen this time?
What's the deal?
Is it some kind of mistake?
Is it a new menu item?
Get what?
Of course I do.
So that's what you meant.
A page from Pops's book.
I wanna try some...
Don't let up now.
I can't wait to try it.
I could do with a bite to eat.
This should be good then.
"My preferences" meaning...?
So that was your plan.
Simple but I still want more.
Like high potential in a bowl.
The ramen... disappeared?
Let's try something besides ramen.
So long as you're paying.
Not today...
You mean, like, right now...?
I can't wait to taste-test.
Why the sudden sweet tooth?
Welp, see ya later.
That's great.
You seem mature and reliable.
You might be a bit much for some.
What's a space cadet?
Is it food?
Right now?
Right here?
I have other plans...
Not exactly...
We all live in the same reality.
Give up and it's all over.
What's the age gap between you?
That's sudden...
Is this a shakedown!?
I totally get it.
Is it really that bad?
Forgetting my phone would be worse.
How teens feel.
Our cashless society.
Inconvenient but fun moments.
It's kind of sad.
I don't think you need to fight.
Maybe he's holding back.
Is there an issue with that?
Mmm, fancy Japanese sweets...
Love 'em.
Watched them all the time as a kid.
I'll watch here and there.
I don't think so.
That seemed normal enough.
Fried chicken.
Rolled omelette.
Rice.
That's a lot of food.
Sounds high-calorie.
Talk about raising the "steaks"!
Sorry, I'm kinda busy...
"There's always next time"?
It's best to do nothing.
That's Leo's problem.
Make sure it's his favorite.
Nothing too special though.
Curry, maybe?
If you must.
Had trouble speaking?
Did you argue with the judges?
"The role asked of you"?
Why do you act?
I didn't do anything special.
All I did was listen.
That's how teens today are.
Someone's a meddling old lady.
He'd appreciate your concern.
Not negatively, at least.
What even happened?
Let's relax first, okay?
Is this about Leo?
I'll go check on him.
Wait here and try to relax.
Let me handle this.
Let's go home.
Looks like I can rest easy.
So you talked it out?
You seem a bit different.
Why leave again?
But you just started opening up!
Was she annoying after all?
Was it really that tough?
You were really struggling.
Teen consultant, at your service.
But you gave it your best.
We having a postmortem?
It could've gone worse!
Easier said than done.
Well it's a valuable lesson.
You're looking for an old store?
What decade are we talking here?
That's so yesterday.
I'm scoping potential date spots.
Would your husband get jealous?
Stars are pretty cool, though.
Are you kidding? I love astronomy!
True, you don't act like an adult.
You have youthful energy.
What does that smell like?
Sweat, then?
Croquettes, I guess?
Shimokita's all about curry bread.
Yeah, you might be right.
I'm a bit of a cineaste myself.
I've heard of those.
What about yellow?
That would be great!
I couldn't ask you to do that...
I can tidy up myself, you know.
You're treating me like a baby...
So you're my mom now?
Looks like I have a stepmom...
I'll only wait one minute.
I'll wait for 100 minutes!
Who's there?
Am I hearing things?
A Golden Drink.
A Silver Drink.
Neither of those.
Hey, the cops are here!
Officer, there's a robbery!
Why do you want to trade drinks?
Make up your mind...
Just tell me what you want...
So a fear of making mistakes...
Look, are we trading or not?
Overcome your fears!
...Are we trading or not?
Walk by
Avoid him
I'm managing.
I am.
Sorry, gotta dash.
I make orders all the time.
I don't use it very often.
That's a great idea.
It's perfect!
Let's check it out together.
How do these look?
I got some good ones.
It's your first order.
Your very first customer.
I was going to take a nap...
Looking forward to the pay.
Food delivery.
Your yakitori has arrived.
But they ordered food...
I'm sure this is the right place.
The customer's out...
I'd like the customer's number.
I'll take care of it.
I came to deliver your yakitori...
Can do.
This is a special, one-time service.
Thank you for waiting.
We do offer free delivery.
It's delicious, so it's fine.
You'll eat it like candy.
Somehow, it worked out...
Piece of cake.
I'll support you.
Let's both give it our best.
Which station?
Might be better to look it up.
You really are bad with directions.
I can show you to the station.
You don't need to know.
Team treadmill.
I need fresh air on my face.
Out for a run?
She's pretty fast...
Just out for a walk.
Enjoying the fresh air.
I'm not too hungry...
I go to Kokatsu.
Do you know Kokatsu Academy?
Why not enter one?
I see them on TV sometimes.
A little bit.
I don't hate it.
Might as well.
It'll be my treat.
I'm finished.
Sweet freedom.
I sure will.
"Rabbit"?
I think I've heard of that...
All set!
Let's run!
Sounds easy enough.
For sure.
I saw a light...
That must've been it.
I think so?
Sounds good.
Let's do this again sometime.
Talk to him
What did you lose?
Tell me what I'm looking for.
We'll look together.
Let's split up and search.
Join in
Not right now
About that puzzle...
They just gave me the stamp.
Nah, it was all you.
Say hello
Leave them alone
I guess I've got no choice.
That's amazing.
I've got stuff to do.
Shopping.
My part-time job.
You know them?
Don't run off too far.
What favor?
I'm kind of busy.
You can't tell her yourself?
Haruna misses you.
What do you want to tell her?
Why not gift him a puzzle?
Shota wants the same thing.
I have time.
Sounds challenging.
It looks like a treasure map.
She's waiting at the treasure.
You really think she'd do that?
Only if you teach me math.
If you insist...
I'd love to!
Not just yet.
No experience. Just passion.
Everyone relies on you.
Being vice president seems tough.
Are things always like this?
You were even better.
You sounded great on lead keyboard.
What's up with Saito?
What's up with Horikita?
Is it because I suck?
Am I not practicing enough?
It's fun.
I feel motivated.
I like getting to see you.
Of course we need it!
Snack parties get results.
Let's aim for the top together.
Is it hard helping the teacher?
You're helping write the new song?
You don't want to compose music?
I want to play a song you wrote.
Are there any copies?
Is it backed up on a computer?
Takanashi should rewrite it.
Do you remember the melody, Takanashi?
I believe in you.
You're our only hope.
It's all thanks to Takanashi.
I'm glad Takanashi could remember it.
Let's keep at it together.
Rain in a drought?
You're welcome, I think...?
Sure, I'll listen.
Is she your girlfriend?
What about our workout...?
Sounds like she's asking you out.
Maybe you should go alone?
Are you okay with a date?
Go somewhere peaceful to talk.
Find a quiet place to relax.
Good luck.
I hope it works out.
Are you sure that was a good idea?
Didn't she just trick you?
Is it enough for you?
You're doing it the wrong way.
You're hurting people.
How did the contract go?
Did the woman call you?
That's good to hear.
I have a delivery.
I'm Anderson's friend.
He's that kind of guy.
You really don't know?
To save your muscles.
He just hoped you'd be healthy.
He said your muscles are honest.
You should do what feels right.
You already know.
Check to make sure
Keep walking
I'm not looking for a membership.
I've worked out there before.
I'd rather not say...
Are you talking to that cat?
Sorry to interrupt...
Do you speak cat?
How do you know what he's saying?
What must I do?
Searching?
Like food?
What kind of treasures are they?
How do I find them?
It seems tough...
He really said that?
This seems a bit sketchy...
How can I say no to that?
I'll do it for the orange tabby.
What? Why?
What's in this thing?
It's for the treasure.
It's for the orange tabby.
I'm glad he's happy.
There's more?
It was pretty fun.
That's a bit far.
He's been to Yongen-Jaya?
I'm up for a treasure hunt.
Okay, lead the way.
Could you repeat that?
He led me here.
Ask the tabby.
How many are there here?
Can I reach it?
It's so close...
No sweat.
That was tough...
Call the old man.
I wanted to ask you something...
The orange tabby...
How did you know?
You guessed it...
Can you speak cat?
Help me out here.
I'm not sure what he's asking.
What do I do next?
Why aren't you saying anything?
We can't give up now.
Sorry to trouble you.
I promised not to look.
It was kinda tough this time.
They're in some weird places.
A calico?
Hi, I'm {NAME1}.
What's she saying?
I'll need your help too.
Sorry to trouble you with this.
Is your owner around?
Must be a stray...
Alright then.
What seems to be the trouble?
It's a bit unnatural.
Don't change it too much.
A little too extreme.
Take it down a notch.
Tell me what happened.
Why weren't you able to sleep?
What did they write?
What were they mad about?
Sounds pretty hectic.
It was a good picture though...
What did they say?
What kind of opinions?
Keep it together.
You do have high standards.
That's a tough one.
I'm no photographer.
I've got nothing better to do.
It seems conventional.
Where's the "change"?
I've seen this on TV.
It's kind of sleazy.
You're taking a picture of him?
Do you need permission for that?
Really captures the aura.
Looks good!
Can't wait.
That doesn't sound good.
What happened last night?
Was it really that idol?
They could tell from that angle?
Answer the phone.
Don't pick up.
It's fine.
Keep it quick.
So what is it?
What kind of help do you need?
What are you planning this time?
Resonate...?
What exactly do you mean?
Not just photos this time?
We're doing video, too?
What will I be doing?
How should I help?
I'll give it a shot...
It's a bit boring...
That doesn't sound like you.
We already have it.
What's been your motif all along?
That's not our intention.
We're just trying to...
We asked the wrong person.
Some people are just like that.
We're not.
No need to worry.
Skipping school isn't good...
We won't tell your mom.
It can't end like this.
Third time's the charm!
Maybe an employee?
If we're customers...
You'll do an interview, then?
So it's okay if we shoot a video?
The topic is "change."
Any changes in your life recently?
What a pity...
Do you regret it?
About what I expected.
Let's upload it anyway.
How's the video doing?
Any reactions online?
Don't leave me hanging here.
You never know what will go viral.
Not bad for your first video.
You can always count on me.
Let's keep doing our best.
And you are...?
Magnificent...?
Sure you're not a weirdo?
They're really nice.
You can feel the energy in them.
But some of them are a bit odd...
Why is there a bottle cap?
Why did you want my picture?
How do I represent "change"?
Okay, fine.
Well, when you put it that way...
You want me in your club?
Do I really look that shifty?
Well, If you say so...
Let's make it to nationals!
I've got this.
Go easy on me.
It was a breeze.
That was close.
Shouldn't we pick up the balls?
Shouldn't we take care of the field?
Are you paying?
Why not ramen?
Probably not.
Does he hate me?
Today's rival is tomorrow's friend.
Nice pass!
I'm taking the shot!
All thanks to your assist.
Were you setting me up to score?
What's up?
Got something to say?
Nanjo Academy?
Are they good?
Leave scoring to me.
Teamwork will win the day.
Did you hit your head?
Your leg...
Are you hurt?
Let's go to the nurse's office.
Let's get you to the hospital.
Your leg hasn't healed.
You're still hurt.
You should sit this one out.
You sure you're okay?
I'll score enough for both of us.
Yeah, I'm ready.
I need to get ready.
Keep an eye on the kid
Leave the older girl to handle it
What do you kids want to play?
Listen to her!
No need to be so formal.
You can drop the "-san".
Want some help?
No need to thank me now.
She'll be back soon.
Do you like her?
Stay for a while
You did great.
I hope you'll become one someday.
That's why you study first aid?
Talk to her
What was she like?
What did your mom do?
Your dad knows about this?
That's really what you want?
And that'll make your dreams come true?
I'm busy now, sorry.
Tell him about your dream.
Are you drunk?
Really? That much?
Thanks for that.
My name is {PLAYER_NAME}.
So... you like booze?
You're drinking again...
I had fun.
Whatever.
This place's what I call class.
Are you tired?
You know how young people are.
You shouldn't be too nosy.
Aren't you worrying too much?
I didn't know about all that.
You shouldn't drink too much.
Just help her relax.
What is she into?
Got any common interests?
Are you going to perform?
Another memory?
You know how to play?
Sounds cool!
I'd love to watch you.
I know you can do it.
You'd want me there?
Should I jam along?
Eat
Maybe not.
Going in can't hurt...
I heart Shibuya!
I accept your challenge!
I'll get that prize!
Bring it!
The flower shop.
The souvenir shop.
The cosmetic store.
Bye-Bye Burger
Boom Bang Burger
Big Dog Burger
Howdy-hey!
A dog.
A cat.
A monkey.
I'm happy too.
Let's see a smile.
I'll get it next time!
I must hone my love for Shibuya...
Dial the number
Don't dial it
I'll find them.
I'm not that interested...
You want me to, right?
You figured me out!
Just look inside real fast.
I'm also going to the bookstore.
I'm headed somewhere else.
I have errands to attend to.
I'm not sure I know them all.
How are you?
I came to see you.
Take a blue marble.
Take an old coin.
Take a silver ring.
Take a red button.
Take a toy necklace.
Take a gold ring.
Bye.
Did you mess up?
Is it hard to talk about?
Just tell them you lost it.
Oof.
I'll help you find it.
Where haven't you looked yet?
Sighing is a bad habit.
Gloom?
Things do feel off.
I don't want that either.
So life should be more colorful?
Want me to strike a pose?
Are you okay to keep going?
Full-body Focus
Coconut Kato Essay
Serialized Pectacular Spectacular
Sure am.
It's tasty.
The flavor's unique.
The classic powder kind.
The easy-to-drink jelly kind.
The stomach-satisfying bar kind.
I'll have the chicken breast.
I'll have the broccoli.
I'll have the white stuff.
What about summer?
What about fall?
What about winter?
What sort of problem?
Let me take a look.
I humbly accept.
Juggle it.
Seal it in a bag.
Pray to it.
Mrs. Curie.
Mrs. King.
Mrs. Nobel.
Affectionate numbers.
Respectful numbers.
Perfect numbers.
You're pretty motivated.
Sure you're not overdoing it?
Why "whirlwind"?
What is that thing?
Yeah, on a crowded train.
Time on a plane never flies by.
More desire is gathered here?
Is it like a condensed Whirlwind?
I'm not ready yet.
Take a look.
Let's go in.
Open the door
Come back later
We should help out.
Faulty circuits?
It does seem strange.
Stay calm now.
They don't seem hostile...
They might have some information.
Let's be careful about this.
A bad time?
You mean the Shadows?
They were in our way.
Katayama-sama...
You mean Ms. Katayama?
Let's move on for now.
We'd better keep exploring.
Let's do that.
Any ideas?
That's handy...
It just needs energy.
With the transmission device.
There are other types of energy.
We just need energy to power it.
On that wall.
It's spinning.
The lighter's reacting...
Look at the lighter.
Let's give it a try.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Let's open it.
I wonder what's gonna happen...
Let's.
Say no more.
Let's keep looking.
We're done here.
I have things left to do.
Let me prepare a bit.
Press it
Press it later
Go in
Press the button
Take more time to prepare
Keep going.
Give me a bit more time.
Off?
I'll take the lead.
A Shadow?
Lost Shadows?
A gathering place?
Is that bad?
Should we do something?
How do we do that?
Can we do anything?
Guess we have no choice...
Looks like a castle.
What's with the big banner?
Let's go inside.
We should investigate the castle.
It's unlocked?
What a careless castle.
You stay with Closer.
I'll go save those two.
Mona's cuter.
You're the cute one, Cattle.
I think you're both adorable.
You do?
But how?
Let's escape together.
It's the heart of this place, so...
It's something important, so...
Exercise the anger away!
Run to lift your mood!
She's doing this for you.
That's Closer's style.
Ah! Over there!
I'm Wonder.
You're making me blush.
You said it.
This guy is unforgivable.
Sure. Can you?
Rings a bell.
I don't think I have...
What's going on?
He sure is excited.
You said it!
Same to you.
It's happening again.
It's like that weird castle...
Let's go find her.
I'm worried about Closer.
Other Phantom Thieves.
Other Persona-users.
They're good people.
They were an interesting bunch.
Thank you for all of your help.
I appreciate it.
Find the others.
Let's search for that Core.
Time to get super involved!
Sup...
Same as ever, I see.
Force our way through.
We can take them.
Like cats and dogs...
Two peas in a pod...
Nothing's happening...
Let's go get it.
They're both ours.
Let's go there.
Let's find our friends.
Time to get that Core!
Money isn't everything.
Moderation is key.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Hi there.
That's so cool...
How about you, Soy?
What would you buy, Soy?
Spend it all.
Money doesn't interest me.
It's all mine!
Been a while.
Glad you're okay.
Take it away, Soy.
Fox, you're up.
Queen, the floor is yours.
Thanks again.
See you next time.
A talking cat?
Did you just talk?
I don't remember...
Sounds familiar...
You're Persona-users, too?
Are you also Phantom Thieves?
Is this your caf\xe9?
Are you the manager?
That was delicious!
You've earned a repeat customer!
Milk and sugar, I guess.
Black.
Maybe try a new kind of curry?
How about a stew?
I've had it.
You sure like fatty tuna.
Don't mind if I do then!
So much softer than feathers...
I go to the gym.
I go to the batting cages.
I sleep like a rock.
I don't really...
I get what you mean.
It's become a staple combo.
I know how you feel.
I'd like to share someday.
I go for the specials too.
I stick with the classics.
Try a flower shop.
Bookstores are good.
I'd like to see it.
What does it look like?
Now I'm curious.
What kind of song is it?
How about cooking?
How about cleaning?
What kind of mask?
Can you even see through it?
Sweet potatoes, maybe?
How about zucchini?
Melon is king.
I'm curious about the flavor.
Great, a sales tactic...
This feels sketchy...
Thank the tourism tax.
Their shaved ice.
The yakisoba.
Nothing comes to mind...
What's your favorite subject?
Got a part-time job?
What's your favorite food?
Thing to bring to a desert island?
I'm a potato lover.
Do potatoes count?
Pa, payappa...?
Payappa!
You look scared...
You're going way too hard.
She sure is.
Tongue twisters?
You're pretty good.
Keyboard.
A wind instrument.
Percussion.
Someone's in a good mood.
What're you singing?
It was a nice tune.
I'd like to hear the rest.
Kinda.
You recognize Ayaka?
Ayaka's famous now?
It's good to have hobbies.
Passion makes perfect, right?
Really? Just for the coat?
That's so you.
You have a friend now.
You started hanging with me.
More does not equal merrier.
Depends on the relationship.
You consider me a friend?
What's gotten into you?
Shall I lend a hand?
I'd like to see.
Can I come over?
It's all in your head.
You're overthinking it.
Hit me.
That'd take two full nights.
Sorry, what?
I might need a translator...
Oh, you just wanted to brag?
Things happen in life.
Hey, stop prying.
Take a guess.
Sounds like a workout.
Was it that good?
I guess they liked it.
I know the feeling.
You prefer happy endings?
Salisbury Steak?
Omelette rice?
You could make both.
Let the kids choose.
Not so much.
I'm more of a paperback person.
I prefer e-books.
Sometimes.
I get it...
Take a chill pill.
Probably country of origin?
Just gotta memorize 'em.
Miso soup.
I grate it into a condiment.
What about croquette burgers?
How about okonomiyaki meals?
White and black are a thing?
I don't know the difference.
You don't look like one to me.
Stubborn yet stunning.
You're cute today, Yaoling.
That looks really good on you.
We're not old enough to drink.
Yaoling is underage, too.
Sounds like a great idea.
I'd love to try it.
Joy?
Betrayal?
That seems just right.
What a lovely contrast.
Once I'm done with everything.
Could you wait a bit?
I don't really have time...
Seems like a lot to remember.
What're you talking about?
You seem to be having fun.
Something bothering you?
Ooh, I want one!
Could I see it?
Is that so?
Like what?
Tired?
We'll find a low-calorie cake.
We should share one.
Why not check with your phone?
Isn't there an app for that?
That's not true at all.
I'd like to try those.
There are others too.
You think so...?
Why not press them?
Take up flower arrangement?
I can't wait for the next one.
Is it run by someone you know?
How do you know them?
Teamwork makes the dream work.
I like lone heroes.
There's a lot to this.
I never imagined.
The big costumed mascot?
I think that's normal?
You look like you to me.
You two are friends now?
I still don't get it.
You two have fun.
I'd get a little scared.
Duck tape.
All intensive purposes.
That's deep...
Talk about confusing.
This is getting complicated.
You're saying you've grown?
You weren't listening.
I wouldn't call that relaxed.
Then what is she like?
You mean the statue?
The one by the station?
There's a soccer club.
We have a band club.
That mascot thing?
I think I've seen it.
It's in Shimokita.
I take the train there.
I'll visit you in America.
I'll aim for the same college.
I think she likes you.
You're already best friends.
A classic sweet one.
Something filling and savory.
Just share your passion.
As long as you're polite...
Usually, yeah.
I don't.
Glasses are better.
Contacts, of course.
A new style could work.
You look great the way you are.
What're you doing?
Hyped?
But why?
Yeah, look at me as a person.
Gotta respect diversity.
Is that really true?
Then why do you drink?
You just sit back and watch?
How do you know what's right?
Then lead by example.
Show them what it's like.
But I'm a total beginner...
I don't feel ready.
Maybe you should wear it.
I'd love to see you in one.
Worried about a rival?
Can't lose to her.
I think they can really chug.
They're probably weaklings.
Can't wait to see you drunk.
Bet you're quite the handful.
What're you watching?
Research?
I'll look into it.
Do we need them?
A fashion show?
Sketch comedy?
I'm happy you're happy.
Can't wait for the show!
You seem stressed.
No, not at all.
Just do you.
So it's the same book?
What changed?
Must be rough.
Gonna buy another five?
You look sad.
Fast way to lose your memory.
Drink till you drown?
Need excitement?
It's too boring?
Can't deny that.
Guys do, too.
You're a good listener.
Must've been awkward.
I have a few.
It's a way to show support.
Maybe they're all good.
Couldn't care about what?
Sumi-san is quite... unique.
You shouldn't listen to him.
You should know when to stop.
Stop teasing the poor kid.
Melon.
Blue Hawaii.
A traditional inn.
A shrine.
You got sunburned?
It really doesn't bother me.
I think it's cute.
Learning a new weapon?
You talking about working out?
Not a bad idea.
Yum...
Sushi? Yes please.
Stop fighting.
We all like different things.
Taste is subjective.
Now, go get ramen together.
Soy can cook up something.
A hippo's about three tons...
Why not change it up?
How about a trade?
Red bean bun.
Miso-flavored peanuts.
Because it's the Metaverse?
Maybe you're gifted?
Lemme guess...
You mean...
I'll be watching.
You wanna note something down?
Like pen and paper?
What's this about?
Memorizing what?
Let me join you.
Need help handling Closer?
Is this about food?
You seem hungry...
Plum juice.
Plum rice.
As if there is.
Minestrone?
Ratatouille?
I second that.
It suits you.
Maybe it'd be like Queen's?
Something like Closer's?
Is this about Violet?
Any other details?
Where did she see it?
What do you have to do?
We have something similar...
There's a place like that.
We've got something similar.
Shocked?
You mean it was big?
He can.
No, he can't.
Yakitori...
Boiled eggs...
Tell me what you found.
You were waiting?
Will this cost money?
How do I use it?
Is that what this does?
How do you use it?
A home theater?
I think it plays movies.
There's just this one?
Looks a bit lonely...
A table and four seats...?
A hunch?
Please, lead the way.
How can I find them?
Are they here today?
I knew that.
I didn't know that.
You're not going to sing?
Never mind.
I hope to hear you sometime.
I'll come back next time.
Yakitori delivery!
A lot.
Maybe fewer than you'd think.
Give it a try
Are you a kid?
I'm glad it's not horror.
Goalkeeper
A Midfielder
Free role... I think.
You're pretty tough.
You look lonely.
I'm by your side.
You time will come.
I heard a strange noise.
Want to try it on?
Masked idols, huh?
I love them.
I think I'll pass...
It's like I'm talking to a wall...
It's not time yet.
I promised.
It's a promise.
I've got other things to do.
Lets talk again when there's time.
Were you thinking about yourself?
My apologies.
I've got urgent business.
Thanks for the compliment.
You're not wrong.
I'm always happy.
I'll make it happen.
We'll see who wins next time!
Burn me a CD.
I am a little hungry...
Hi.
Spare change?
A new Menace?
You mean the Divine Judgment stuff?
What is a Menace, anyway?
Why don't the police catch them?
What does the public think?
I'm good for now.
Different how?
That would be a lot of work.
No one has the time?
It's a weird world out there.
I don't see the appeal.
What's Divine Judgment?
What's a certified Menace?
Thoughts on Divine Judgment?
I need to be somewhere...
Anyone can post there?
Anyone can view this site?
Because they're dangerous?
Why are they chosen?
That's a pretty big downside.
Must lead to tons of false rumors.
The birth of humanity.
The ending of a war.
The Japanese language's creation.
Debate.

It would all be forfeit.

To keep our promises.

Yes, it's impossible.
