If you enter the camera's <color=#FF423F>surveillance area</color>, the security level will immediately <color=#FF423F>rise</color>.
This camera will cycle between on and off.\nIf you enter the surveillance area while the camera is <color=#FF423F>on</color>, the security level will immediately rise.
The security level of the current area is displayed by the <color=#FF423F>Security Level Gauge</color> on the left side of the minimap.
The security level is displayed on the Security Level Gauge.\nWhen the level is high, enemies will be more vigilant.
If you are spotted by an enemy, the security level of the entire Palace will increase.\nIf you defeat an enemy without being seen, the security level will decrease.
Many devices in the Palace require <color=#FF423F>energy</color> to operate.\nBy using the <color=#FF423F>Energy Transfer Device</color>, energy can be transferred between different locations.
Aim the <color=#FF423F>sights</color> toward an object that can have energy absorbed, then press and hold the <color=#FF423F>Absorb</color> button to transfer.
Similarly, you can move the <color=#FF423F>sights</color> to an object that can receive energy, then press and hold the <color=#FF423F>Emit</color> button to transfer energy into that object.
Each object has its own <color=#FF423F>energy capacity</color>. The icon on the left side indicates if an object has a <color=#FF423F>limit</color> to its energy capacity.
The <color=#FF423F>thermal energy</color> constantly generated by the reservoir tank creates high-temperature steam that blocks the way ahead.\nTry <color=#FF423F>transferring</color> the thermal energy to a different tank.
Using the new <color=#FF423F>Energy Transmission Device</color> allows you to <color=#FF423F>continuously</color> transmit energy from one object to another.
Using the sights on one side of the device, select an object to <color=#FF423F>drain energy</color> from.
Using the sights on the opposite side of the device, select an object to <color=#FF423F>transmit energy</color> to.
After you select an object that can <color=#FF423F>be drained of energy</color> and another that can <color=#FF423F>receive energy</color>, energy will be <color=#FF423F>continuously transmitted</color> between them.\nIf the aiming sights are moved away from one object, the transmission will be interrupted.
You can use the kinetic energy stored within objects.\nBy transferring collected <color=#FF423F>kinetic energy</color> to a device, you can move objects.
There are <color=#FF423F>energy-draining devices</color> throughout the Palace which control doors and other mechanisms.\nTo unlock them, you must bring a robot with the corresponding type of energy nearby to interact with the device.
<color=#FF423F>Robots</color> work at the Power Plant to transport energy, and can carry any type of energy needed.\nInteract with them to make them <color=#FF423F>follow</color> you, and they can help you interact with other devices in the Palace.
When a robot is following you, interact with them again to switch them to <color=#FF423F>inactive</color> mode.
There is <color=#FF423F>breakable glass</color> in the Palace. You can <color=#FF423F>attack</color> it to shatter it.
After breaking the glass, you can climb through the window to access the next area.
You can also absorb robots' energy with the\nEnergy Collector and use it to power\ncorresponding devices.
You can connect a robot carrying energy to an <color=#FF423F>Energy Transfer Device</color> by moving it near the device.\nSelect <color=#FF423F>Store Energy</color> to store the energy in the device.
By transmitting energy through the <color=#FF423F>Energy Conduction Pole</color>, you can connect to another Energy Transfer Device.
You can connect a robot with no energy to an <color=#FF423F>Energy Transfer Device</color> to receive energy.\nIf both of them have energy, an <color=#FF423F>Energy Exchange</color> will occur.
<color=#FF423F>Flying robots</color> may steal the energy carried by other robots.\nBy storing the energy in a different device, you can avoid being targeted by flying robots.
By <color=#FF423F>rotating</color> the Energy Conduction Pole, the direction of energy transmission can be changed to different devices.
An <color=#FF423F>error</color> will occur if the Energy Collection Device's <color=#FF423F>emission ends are facing each other</color>, or if <color=#FF423F>two energy lines are entered</color>.\nFix the rotation to correct it.
Some doors in the Palace are operated with a different kind of <color=#FF423F>Energy Absorption Device</color>. You will need to provide the correct type of energy to open the door.
The Electric Barrier Door in the Palace will not allow anyone to pass besides robots.\nBring a robot to the switch next to the door to authenticate it, allowing it to pass through.
By using the <color=#FF423F>Robot Control Panel</color>, you can switch to the robot's view and operate it.
Robots can pass through the <color=#FF423F>Electric Barrier Door</color>.\nBy accessing the <color=#FF423F>Authentication Switch</color>, the corresponding Electric Barrier Door can be disabled.
From the operation view, you can <color=#FF423F>access other devices</color>.
Some passages can be opened by moving near them, but others cannot be opened.
Mental Energy is the energy harvested from the emotions of the dam workers.
Similar to thermal energy or electricity, Mental Energy can be stored, extracted or transmitted.
The small and large monitors are connected based on color.
Match the colors of the small and large monitors in order to pass.
Using the Mind Control Device, you can alter the thoughts of the Dam control center workers.
Reconnecting two nodes will change how the workers think.
The Mental Interference Lamp will affect the mind of anyone nearby, so be sure to avoid it.
The lamp emits a psychic pulse affecting the minds of those within its radius.
When you have Mental Energy, you can use mind control.
When affected by Mental Interference, there may be strange effects on your vision. Be careful.
You can easily play using various input methods.\nIn RPG mode, you can use a gamepad or a keyboard and mouse.
The first person to play all the cards in their hand is the winner.\nIn <color=#FF423F>Classic</color> mode, play a match against the CPU.\nIn <color=#FF423F>Ranked Match</color>, play 3 fixed rounds against a matched opponent.
Tycoon is a 4-player card game.\nYou can choose to play 1 or 3 rounds.\nAt the start of the game, each player is dealt 14 cards.
The object of the game is to play all of the cards in your hand before the other players.
Points will be awarded based on the order in which players have played all their cards.\n#1: Tycoon (30 points), #2: Rich (20 points), #3: Poor (10 points), #4: Beggar (0 points).
Based on the scores from either the 1 game or 3 game modes, the total scores will be calculated, an overall ranking will be determined, and each player will receive Tycoon Points accordingly.
If two players have the same score, they will receive the same place in the overall rankings.
In Tycoon, a card's number will decide its strength.\nThe <color=#FF423F>weakest card is 3</color>, continuing upwards to 4, 5 and so on. The <color=#FF423F>strongest card is 2</color>.
The active player can play cards, and there are a number of ways to do so:\nOne card, a pair, three of a kind, or four of a kind.
The turn order proceeds clockwise.\nWhen you play cards, they must be <color=#FF423F>the same number of cards</color> and a <color=#FF423F>higher rank</color> than the previous player.\nIf you can't play any cards, or choose not to, you can <color=#FF423F>Pass</color> and skip your turn.
The player holding the <color=#FF423F>3 of diamonds</color> will go first. From there, the Beggar begins the round.
At the start of the second round, players may <color=#FF423F>exchange cards</color>.
The Tycoon and Beggar exchange 2 cards each, and the Rich and Poor exchange 1 card each.\nThe Poor and Beggar must choose the strongest cards in their hand (excluding the Wonder card).
Playing a 3 of Spades after a single Joker card will trigger a <color=#FF423F>3-Spade Reversal</color> and end the round.
Playing 4 of the same rank triggers a <color=#FF423F>Revolution</color>, reversing the strength of all cards.
If you play another 4 of a kind when a Revolution is active, it triggers a <color=#FF423F>Counter Revolution</color>, returning all cards' strength to normal.
Playing an 8 will cause an 8 Stop, which forces the round to end. The player who played the 8 card will get to start the next round.
The Joker is stronger than a 2, or stronger than a 3 during a Revolution. It can also be played as a wild card in place of other numbers.\nIf you play it as pictured here, it will become a <color=#FF423F>Revolution</color>.
When you play <color=#FF423F>Wonder</color>, you can activate an <color=#FF423F>X Stop</color>, instantly ending the round regardless of the other cards played.
If the Tycoon is not able to maintain their status during the next round, that player will lose the round and <color=#FF423F>become the Beggar</color>.
On the Den Level screen, you can check all of your Thieves Den level effects, and claim rewards when you reach certain levels.
When you invite an accomplice to visit your Thieves Den, you will gain Visitor EXP over time.\nAs you gain experience, your <color=#FF423F>Visitor Level</color> with them will increase.
When your Visitor Level increases, you can earn P Medals, and at certain levels you will unlock special events with your accomplices.
On the Effects screen, you can check the effects of all items you have collected in the Thieves Den. These effects are applied even if the items are not on display.
You can check all the collection items available in the Thieves Den.
Once you have met the conditions for collecting or unlocking an item, it can be claimed or purchased here.
If you don't want to play any cards on your turn, you can choose to pass to the next player.
You'll have to pass if you do not have any cards you can play.\nIf all players pass, the round will end.
