"Answer in 50 words or less."
"Aroma" this,\n"hot spring minerals" that,\nyou name it.
"Contrary to expectations."
"Cream Soda!"
"Hula" means "dance", and\n"salsa" means "sauce".
"I'm totally gonna fail this\ntest! Help me cram!"
"Salutations"?
"Surprisingly"? What did he\nmean by that?
"The dude on the bass was\ngood. Is he in your band?"
"What kind of person do you\nwant to be in the future?"
"What matters is\nwhat comes next."
'Cause I need a new vacuum\ncleaner and a kettle too!\nLife is hard.
'Cause when we were\nplaying together earlier,\nI was thinking...
'Night, guys.

...and I'd like you to\ncheck it to make sure\nmy Japanese is correct!
...and I'd wish you'd\nhurry up and become a\nmature young man already.
...before such a feat can be achieved.
...By which I mean your\nvirtual room, of course!
...it doesn't mean\nyou don't change.
...we could be with each other\nuntil morning.
20-20 vision.
\xa1Buenas noches!\nNi hao!\nHiiiii!
A bassist has always gotta\nbe on point with both\nthe rhythm and root notes.
A bunch of stuff.\nA new mic, headphones,\nan audio interface...
A bunch of them seem like\nthey'd totally be your thing!
A corrupt producer can ruin\neven the most talented idol.
A handkerchief!
A little bit, yeah... But more\nhappy than anything else.
A long time ago, I sprinkled\nsome on a friend's watermelon.
A long time ago, I was able\nto get my hands on psychic\ntraining tools.
A lot of them are pretty cute\ntoo with these unique poses.
A lot of words related to\nfoods and seasonings\ntend to double up.
A major impediment to our\ngreat quest has appeared...
A message came through\nMiyazawa's manager apologizing\nto Victory Kitchen.
A new ramen place\nopened up near school.
A place by the station.
A stylist in my neighborhood.
A unit name?
Aaaaahhhhh!!!\nI knew it! Nooo!
About the sauce?
About today's modern lit\nhomework...
According to my research\non idol photo shoots...
Act the way you wanna be seen.
Actually, I guess that's a bit\nof an oxymoron...
Actually, I'm making pasta\nwith Musubi right now.
Adults are always telling us\nto watch our language\nand stuff.
After all, I've learned\nprivate inquiries are taboo.
After all, the best way\nto recreate something is\nto see it with your own eyes!
After all, we're the\nchosen ones!
After our photo shoot\nthe other day...
After years out of the\npublic eye, she has returned\nto the spotlight.
Ah, but I guess you\naren't a housewife...
Ah, excuse me!
Ah, good idea. Hope they\nhave somethin'.
Ah, I see. Sorry to hear it...\nThere's always\nnext time!
Ah, if we rent it out,\npets might be okay.
Ah, so you were thinking\nabout me even during\nyour own solo then...
Ah, somewhere nice and close!
Ah, that's too bad.\nWell, lemme if you\nchange your mind.
Ahaha, those things're mostly\nfluff, don't ya think?
Ahh, you can't go wrong with\ngames. They're perfect for\nkilling time!
Ahhh! I said it!\nOkay, bye bye!
Akashi is unbelievable...
Aliases?
All I can do now is pray for\nNaruru to find peace.
All I can think about today\nis cream soda.
All right, I'm goin' to\nbed then.
All the time.
Allow me to show you\naround this world!
Almost a full-fledged fan!
Also, anything come to mind\nthat's popular with\nhigh schoolers these days?
Also, for the record...
Also, it's not a "thing"\nI'll have you know!
Although I am reluctant to use\nthe term "fan" to describe\nmy relationship with them.
Although they did make sure to\nsqueeze in a humblebrag about\ngetting autographs after.
Although you gotta agree\nthat this is an absolute gem\nof a find. Haha.
Amazing.
An elementary schooler.\nTurns out it was the\nperfect fit, too!
An intriguing proposal... But\nwould it not require the unit\nto consist of multiple idols?
And also...
And before I knew it,\nI sent you a text.\nSorry, haha!
And don't forget to lock up\nwhen you leave the house!
And for some reason I was\npicked as the replacement.
And for that, I must say,
And how does Kotone feel?
and I figured that I really\nneed to keep in shape.
And I forgot to save\nthe photo.
And I thought I'd buy my\nmom and dad something\nwith the money.
And it looks like reciting\nan incantation isn't enough\nto summon an evil entity.
And it's been\nsuper-duper helpful.
And Leo-chan's going to be\noff doing his own thing\nsoon too...
And remember to water the\nplants outside.
and some girls around your age\ncame up to listen.
And still have room\nfor noodles.
And that's a promise!
And that's what kind of person\nI want to become.
And the book was a grimoire of\ndemon-summoning rituals!
And the rights to the shop\nwere returned to Pops.
And they're running\nthis opening promo.
And this guy from a record\ncompany asked if I would\nput out a song with them!
And we've left you some money\nto cover any expenses,\nso don't go wasting it.
And when he was done...
Anyone would feel the same.
Anything for Naruru.
Anyway! No surprise pinch\nof salt on your watermelon.
Anyway, I have a favor to ask.\nWould you mind recording me?
Anyway, I hope you continue\nto keep in touch with both me\nand Leo-chan, okay?
Anyway, I just thought I'd let\nyou know the spell was fake.
Anyway, I'm going to\nput the show on now.
Anyway, see ya!
Anyway, their tails\nstarted bouncing along\nto the rhythm...
Anyway...
Anyway... We always have\nto stick together for stuff\nlike this! Safety first!
Anyways, I've been called to\nthe faculty office. I need\nto go now.
Apparently he's holding an\nemergency press conference\nthis afternoon.
Apparently she's going to\nskate to the song I chose\nfor her!
Apparently, it comes from\nthe Japanese word "shoyu".
Apples grow in cold climates.\nThe greater the difference in\ntemp between day and night,
Apples, however,\ngrow well when cold!
Apples.
Appreciate it.
Are they just posting\nwhatever they want to try to\nwear me down?
Are they your favorite?
Are you a model student?
Are you familiar with\nlive-action hero shows?
Are you feeling sick?
Are you giving up?
Are you interested in idols?
Are you making proper use\nof the Phantom Idols?
Are you mastering Persona fusion?
Are you okay? The house\ndoesn't feel too empty,\ndoes it?
Are you prepared?
Are you ready to\nenter Mementos?
Around the same time,\nJapanese people from the\nGoto Islands in Nagasaki...
As a legitimate idol,\nNaruru would be\nin the center.
As always, you exceed\nmy expectations.
As long as you learn from it.
As such, I shall not even\nshare details of\nthe store's location.
As such, I wish to clarify\nthat I would never abandon\nmy duties.
As such, this charm has the\npotential to raise desire.
As the leader of the Phantom\nThieves, you must connect with\nyour allies and build trust.
As you can probably tell,\nI was very drunk back then.
Ask anyone else and they'd\nonly bring up rice and bread.
Ask for his autograph!
At any rate, I'll do my best\nto make sure it doesn't\nget any worse!
At any rate, the fact that\nI have to show good results\nhasn't changed a bit.
At Central Street, 'kay?
At first I thought he was just\nsome guy in a wheelchair...
At the hospital?
At the very least, she has the\nqualities I seek in an idol.
At this point, just seeing\nyour face is enough\nto calm my nerves.
Attach it to something else.
Awesome! I'll be waiting\nat my usual spot.
Awesome! I'm looking forward\nto learning a lot from you!
Awesome! Let's meet somewhere.
Awesome. I'm always ready\nfor some coaching!
Aww geez, I'd take the\nconstant nagging any day\nover a ticking time bomb!
Aww geez... Somehow that\nfeels even heavier, y'know?
Aww, I want a pet so badly!
Aww, I want cheap burgers.
Aww, you're making me blush.\nBut go on! Keep the\ncompliments flowing!
Backtracking a bit...
Bad news...
Bam, back to zero savings\nwith just a few mouse clicks.
Basically, soy is a\nJapanese loanword.
Be my overseas tour guide!
Be right there.
Be strong, stand your ground!
Because we're friends?
Before we harvest the cyber\nwatermelons, I have to ask...
Behold! The new Yui\nis here, bursting with\nserene tranquility!
Being a housewife is all about\nbuying the best thing possible\nat the cheapest price.
Being a musician\nis so expensive!
Believe it or not, I used to\nwork in fashion.
Better luck next time!
Better make sure I don't\nhave any work that day.
Better put my nose to the\ngrindstone, as they say...
Both would be no mean feat.
Both, I think...\nI'm half afraid,\nhalf excited... Heh.
Bring on the taste-test-athon!
Burgers are so expensive\nthese days, huh! They used\nto be a lot cheaper.
Business must be booming.
But a bunch of them actually\nagreed to do it!
But almost all the films\nI wanted to watch aren't\navailable there anymore.
But as they say, you'll never\nknow unless you try.
But because of that...
But diehard fans like me and\nmy folks know it anywhere.
But do give it some thought\nonce the time comes,\nwill you?
But even if it's a lie, it\nstill bothers me.
But everyone's so busy now,\nI hardly get a chance to\ninvite them out.
But I actually don't know what\nsort of things they like.
But I can still remember\nall the rules in baseball.
But I can't relax till I hear\nit straight from the horse's\nmouth.
But I don't know the first\nthing about tutoring...
But I found it\npretty complex...
But I found this one that's\nbeen floating around\nthe web recently...
But I guess if I'm gonna\nbe a Phantom Thief,\nI'll need some gall.
but I haven't talked to him\nmuch since I got here.
But I just can't find one\nthat feels right for me.
But I just can't\nget it right...
But I know that if I exercise\nby myself, I'm probably gonna\nslack off.
But I know that talking to you\nhelps me sort out how I feel.
But I was wrong.
But I will consider it.
But I would have never even\nconsidered eating it the way\nthey serve it here\u2014raw.
But I'll take your suggestion\nand look forward to continuing\nour chat tomorrow.
but I'm happy to say\nI've wiped the whole thing\nfrom my brain box.
But I'm not sure what I\nshould get. Do you have\nany suggestions?
but I've been trying\nand it's not easy...
But if I hold back, and\nend up failing to convey\nwhat I want to, well...
But if I was helpful\nto you in the slightest,\nthen I am satisfied.
But if we're not on a mission,\nyou can just use my real name.
But in my defense...
But instead of beating\nmyself up and backing off...
But it basically means\nthe real deal! Not the dishes\ntweaked for Japanese palates.
But it could be nice to pair\nthem with some food.
But it doesn't seem like it\nworked properly, either way.
But it ended up\nbeing really fun!
But it is full of nature,\nwhich is something you don't\ntend to see in the city.
But it looks like it was\njust an illusion created\nby the camera angle...
But it seems I was worrying\nfor nothing!
But it's not like you have all\nthe money in the world, right?
But it's worse for me since\nI do flair bartending.
But like, there were a bunch\nthat I wasn't sure how you\ncould play with that setup.
But man, I couldn't believe\nhow many bath salts\nthey stock in this country!
But maybe people just want to\nget things done without the\nfuss of talking with anyone?
But maybe this means that\nI still have a sharp eye\nwhen it comes to looks?
But Mom said I can't go\nunless I'm with an adult.
But my impression of you\nhas changed!
But nothing's come after me.\nI haven't even sensed\nanything unholy.
But now that I've quit...\nit's only getting worse.
But now, I think my love for\nit is a good thing... Maybe?
but on our trip before,\nwe talked about the songs\nyou play in your club, right?
But people close their eyes\nto it all so easily!
But some really\nover-the-top types\nin class got behind it...
but thanks for everything.
But that might not be what\nthe customer wants.
But that rule only applies\nto eating out.
But that's not all! I also got\na synth keyboard, more cables,\nand some spare strings.
But the manager threw in\nthe towel after one bite...
But the trust of the people\ncan be useful. I intend to put\nin the appropriate effort.
But their roasted pork slices\nreally stood out.
But then Motoha was raving\nabout this one streaming site,\nso I signed up.
But then the software wouldn't\nlaunch, and my PC wouldn't\ndetect the audio interface...
But they all just said they're\ndoing fine and... like...
But things are getting tough.
But this may be the very\nanswer to the type of person\nI want to become.
But we won't know until\nyou're old enough to drink.
But we're neighbors first and\nforemost, so here's to years\nof good memories to come!
But we're Phantom Thieves?
But when it comes to baseball,\nI guess they're infused with\nmy muscle memory?
But when the nurse wheeled\nhim by, I recognized his face\nright away!
But when the time comes...
But you don't really see them\ndangling from people's phones\nthese days, do you?
But, a lot of people\nseem pretty excited\nto see her return!
But... I have no clue what\nto do with my spare mitt\nand stuff I don't need.
By all means.
By the way, feel free to use\nwhatever's in the fridge if\nyou feel like cooking.
Can I use your kitchen?
Can Lufel come too?
Can you come back to the\nclassroom? There's something\nyou should see.
Can you tell what I'm\nlooking at right now?
Can't beat a dog's loyalty.
Can't even imagine.
Can't get enough.
Can't today, sorry...
Can't wait to see your moves.
Case closed!
Cats really like you, huh?
Cause you do all the talking.
Cheater...
Chill beats.
Classic chosen one stuff.
Coach Tomoko in the house!
Codes?
Cold noodles.
Colorful ones.
Come by whenever.
Come to think of it, teaching\ntechniques was pretty easy!
Comedies all the way.
Congratulations!
Consider it my way of saying\nthanks for all the things\nyou teach me!
Cool, me too.
Cool. Good to know.
Cool. I'll see what\nI can do...
Cool. Try to hurry, okay?
Could grow some veggies?
Could it be...
Could this be a prelude\nto something greater?
Could this be your big break!?
Could you help me go over\nmy math textbook again?
Damn it...
Darkness?
Define "cook."
Denying it was my fault. I was\njust trying to make excuses\nto cover up for myself.
Depends on where you live,\nhuh. Like, pasta in Italy.
Did it 'cause you told me to.
Did they show up?
Did this message surprise you?
Did you get to meet him?
Did you hear what everyone was\ntalking about in class today?
Did you know some Japanese\nwords exist in Chinese too,\nbut have different meanings?
Did you say hi?
Did you see the commercial for\nthe new films that were just\nadded to that streaming site?
Did you see the news today?
Did you see what's on\nDivine Justice?
Didn't mean to get you\nall worried.
Didn't mean to put you\non the spot, sorry. Let me\nknow when you're free.
Didn't realize the story was\nso sad. I straight up cried\nat the end.
Divvying ideas up into\nteachable chunks\nis hard.
Do moms really want to know\nabout this stuff?
Do people still have pen pals?
Do you do anything else?
Do you eat yours with salt?
Do you even know what\nI'm talking about?
Do you guys talk a lot?
Do you guys wanna watch the\npress conference together at\nlunch?
Do you have a favorite fruit?
Do you have any shops\nyou'd recommend?
Do you have any\nrecommendations\nfor a good movie?
Do you have time tomorrow\nafter school?
Do you know how to enter\nother worlds?
Do you make your own dinner?\nThat must be tough.
Do you mind if I message\nyou to talk like this\nfrom time to time?
Do you recall our discussion\nabout live-action heroes?
Do you recall two employees\nwho informed us of\nNaruru's plight?
Do you remember that baseball\npro staying at my hospital?
Do you remember what was\ngoing through your head\nwhen you did that improv bit?
Do you see yourself in them?
Do you take videos?
Do you think I could borrow\na moment of your time?
Do you want to live here?
Do you?
Does authentic mean spicy?
Does it now?
Does that count as an idol?
Does that happen to you?
Does this help you cook?
Doesn't mean things are easy.
Dog-faced man?
Don't forget the dessert.
Don't forget your goal.
Don't go neglecting your\ngrades for our farm!
Don't say things that could\nruffle people's feathers,\nthey say.
Don't talk about school much?
Don't tell me that he's\nsecretly expecting more\nfrom me than Mama!
Don't worry about me,\nI've got this.
Don't you ever get lonely\nliving by yourself?
Donate it to your old team.
Earlier, I attempted a ritual\nto summon a spirit of\ngood fortune...
Earlier, I was working out\na riff for a song on the keys\nand suddenly thought of you.
Either they were hella brave,\nor incredibly desperate.
Emailing friends...?
Empathy is important.
English is handy for reading\nbooks from all over the world.
Especially when I have\nsomething super important\nto say.
Even as a chosen one, I don't\nwant to be overly conspicuous.
Even for chosen ones,\ntelepathy is difficult.
Even indirectly...
Ever tried rice?
Every step of the setup,\nI was getting endless\nstupid errors.
Everyone had something to\nsay about whether they'd\ngive up or give in.
Exactly! A chosen one must\nconceal their true identity.
Exactly, Prince of Darkness.
Exactly. Focusing on what's\nright or wrong isn't enough.
Excellent, fellow chosen one.\nLet's go investigate.
Excuse me. I wish for us to go\nsomewhere together to better\nunderstand your true self.
Excuse me. I wish to propose\nwe do something that differs\nto our usual meetings.
Fair enough. For some reason,\nthat makes me glad.
Feeling nervous about it?
Feels like it's been forever\nsince I brought up a friend.
Find some time to go,\nit'd be such a waste to let\nthis chance pass you by!
Focus on conveying your thoughts.
Focus on the biggest thing.
Food grudges can last\nan entire lifetime,\nyou know!
For a split second,\nwe crossed behind the person\ngetting interviewed!
For now, I shall welcome you\nas a fellow fan.
For now, it is vital that\nI "like" Naruru's posts on\nthe caf\xe9's social media.
For school, I have to\nsqueeze all the information\ninto my brain.
For sure. I'm still trying to\nfigure out what it is I want.
French fries have waaay too\nmany. It made me so sad.
Friends? With me?\nNo, I couldn't impose.
From what I have observed,\nyou share many traits.
Fun should be number one.
Gave yourself to\nthe rhythm, huh?
Geez, all this stuff has gone\nto show me just how childish\nI can be.
Getting there costs money too.
Glad I came to you.\nI'll let you know\nhow it goes!
Go to the drugstore.
Going back over and reading\nthat is making me feel\nkind of embarrassed...
Good call. Can't go wrong\nwith that.
Good day to you!
Good idea! That way it's sure\nto end up in the hands of\nsomeone who needs it.
Good idea. They're retro,\nbut still cute. I'll find\nsomewhere else to put them.
Good idea... Maybe it's\nnot too late to get my\nvisual acuity back.
Good job, Teach.
Good luck! And stay safe!
Good morning! It's morning\nthere, isn't it?
Good night! Sleep tight!
Good thing you spoke up.
Good work!
Goodnight.
Got any friends who'd be\ninterested in women's\nbaseball gear?
Got any ideas on how to\nimprove your sleep quality?
Got your thoughts sorted?
Gotcha. Maybe some other time.
Gotta be easy work.
Gotta say, that's a relief\nto hear, Sensei. Thanks!
Great for emotional training.
Great idea!
Great work today, everyone.
Great! As your mocktail\nmentor, I'm glad to see\nyou put in the effort.
Great! I know this is sudden,\nbut are you able to come over\nnow?
Great! I'll wait at the front\nof the shop!
Great! I'll wait for you\nat my usual spot.
Great! Let me know when you're\nall set up!
Great! Well, you know\nwhere to find me!
Great, thanks so much!\nSo, where's a good spot\nfor us to meet?
Great, thanks!
Great. I feel a lot better.
Great. Then let's plan\na day to go sometime!
Guess I said something\na little weird, huh.\nI'll mull it over a bit more.
Guess what Musubi told me!
Ha ha, I thought you'd\nsay that! And honestly,\nI really needed to hear it.
Haha, it's fun to see\nsomeone who's always\nso calm let loose.
Haha, not to brag, but you're\nspeaking to the freshman who\ngot the top grades in English!
Haha. Hilarious.
Hahaha!
Hahaha! Hey, I was\njust kidding, you know!\nYou're such a cutie!
Hang on. I'd better explain\nthe situation first.
Have any high school hobbies?
Have trouble sleeping?
Have you heard about\nthe cursed video?
Having a feline audience\nfelt kinda weird, but in\na good way.
Having to see a kid off is\nso sad! It was the same\nwith my own son.
He definitely didn't do it.
He got a bit screwy.
He laughed and said I was\nsurprisingly friendly.
He offered me a job.
He praised me like\nnever before.
He respects your independence?
He thanked me for remembering\nhim, and burst into tears.
He told me he's been\nrunning every morning\nfor ninety years!
He told me...
He was never a bad guy.
He's a one-hundred-year-old\ngrandpa who lives in the\nneighborhood.
He's going down.
Hearing that makes me feel\na little better.
Heavy.
Heck, I might have to give\nsome of these salts a shot.
Hee hee! You're the second one\nto call me that, after Motoha.
Heeeyyyyyy!
Heh, of course we can't lose\nto some demon...
Heh, thanks.
Heh... Can't you see? With the\nforces of yin and yang working\nin unison, we are unstoppable!
Hehe, more! Praise me more!
Hehe, sounds good to me!\nRice bowls with toppings\nof the day, huh...?
Hehe... Very good.\nI can feel my telepathic\nskills awakening.
Hehehe, don't take me\ntoo seriously.
Hello there!\nAre you free at the moment?\nCause I sure am!
Hello! It's me! Yui!
Hello. Thank you\nfor the other day.
Her comeback at the next\ncompetition is all anybody's\ntalking about.
Heritage Kitchen?\nIn Zoshigaya?
Hey Leader, I got a favor to\nask you.
Hey Sensei, do you read\nautobiographical manga?
Hey! No one asked for\na walking dictionary.
Hey! You free right now?
Hey!\nI'm a beautiful lady\u2014not cute!
Hey, can't blame me for being\ncurious. When it comes to\nflavors, I'm always serious...
Hey, did you see the news\non TV just now?
Hey, happy birthday!
Hey, I could use your help.
Hey, I know this is sudden...
Hey, I wanna talk to you\nabout something...
Hey, I've got a favor to ask,\nRusset!
Hey, it happens.
Hey, remember our soy talk?
Hey, remember when I asked you\nfor film recommendations on\nthat streaming platform?
Hey, Russet.
Hey, Sensei!\nGot some free time today?
Hey, Sensei, umm...\nDo you have time today?
Hey, so have you been wearing\nthe clothes I gave you?
Hey, take it easy.
Hey, uhh...\nare you busy lately?
Hey, you busy?
Hey, you busy?\nThere's something\nI gotta ask you.
Hey, you free now?
Hey, you free right now?
Hi! I know this is a bit\nout of the blue, but\nare you free today?
History repeats itself.
Hm, I see. It happens\nto me a lot.
Hm... If you say so...\nBut still...
Hm... Okay, lemme\nrephrase my question.
Hm... Yeah, maybe.
Hm... Yeah, that makes sense.\nI think it's the same for me.
Hmm... I wouldn't say that.
Hmm... Is that it?\nNot sure if I agree.
Hmmm, come to think of it...\nit's more like the rules are\ningrained in my body.
hone their craft over time is\na satisfying sight.
Honestly, I'm a little\njealous. I wish I was in the\nsame class as you guys.
Hope he gets better soon!
Hope you get to talk to him!
Hope you have a great day!
Hopefully, once my report's\ndone, inspiration will strike\nand I can play you the song!
Horror? I kinda hate\njump scares...
Hot pots are my go-to.
How about "friends"?
How about "naan bread"?
How about hitting the batting\ncages after school?
How about potted flowers?
How am I gonna cope...?
How could I forget?
How did it go?
How did she transform\nduring her time away?
How did you learn them?
How do you deal\nwith heartburn?
How do you usually\npass the time?
How does he do it?
How far will you go?
How was it in baseball?
How would you\nabbreviate that I wonder...\n"Socmed pals," maybe?
How ya feelin', Senpai?
How you greet her beforehand\nis of vital importance.
How'd it go?
How's it differ to the city?
However, if idols are meant\nto show us dreams, then I do\nbelieve I was dreaming.
However, some devout fans\ncontinue to watch even\ninto adulthood.
Huh, okay! I'll check out\none or two when I have\nthe time.
Huh, so that's what living\nalone is like?
Huh, yeah. I can\nunderstand that.
Huh, you might be right.
Huh... So like, show Motoha\nhow I study for exams?
Huh? What do you mean\nthat's what it means?
Huh? What was I\nso worried about?
Humans cannot live\nwithout desire.
Hunger is the best spice.
I added Riko-senpai to our\nchat group!
I admire it.
I admit I am not familiar\nwith such names.
I also can't wait for you\nto hear them!
I always give new teas a try\nwhen I spot them in the\nconvenience store.
I always struggle to come up\nwith an answer when she asks\nme how university's going.
I am aware that I am a\nconcierge, not a producer.
I am ever loyal to Naruru, but\nI also enjoy their company.
I am here to support you. In\nreturn, I ask that you apply\nyourself diligently each day.
I am merely interested in her\ntransformation as an idol.
I am pleased to hear that.\nI shall be waiting for you.
I am prepared! I'm not a\nchosen one for nothing!
I appear to be unaffected...\nThe inner workings of such a\nspell remain a mystery to me.
I appreciate the space,\nbut I admit it does\nbother me a bit.
I appreciate your\nunderstanding.
I ask for your continued\ncooperation.
I ask that you refrain from\nmisleading comments.
I assume you heard from\nLeo-chan already, but he's\ngoing to be leaving.
I barely put any effort into\nmaking dinner, and my cleaning\ngets pretty sloppy too.
I basically had to look up\nevery single fix, but I\ngot it done in the end.
I believe she more than has\nthe potential to become\nan idol.
I believe you've begun to\nunderstand Naruru's charm.
I bought them forever ago.
I came across such a show\nwhile strolling Akihabara.
I can educate you on\nNaruru's charm another time.
I can fill you in more at my\nusual spot, so meet me there.
I can hardly wait for\nthe competition!
I can imagine.
I can instantly check\nwhat I'm doing well\nor getting wrong.
I can make whatever I like.
I can't decide.
I can't do that right now,\nI'm afraid.
I can't help but bite back\nwhen someone disagrees\nwith me.
I can't recall important dates\nin history, but I'll never\nforget a friend's birthday.
I can't remember the last time\nI went on a trip with your\nfather...
I can't seem to remember\nanything we learn at school.
I can't stop scrolling\nthrough online videos\nwhen I'm bored...
I cooked with it today!
I could sense a strong\nconviction within her.
I couldn't exactly get\neveryone on board...
I couldn't forget what\nI've learned here,\neven if I wanted to.
I couldn't help but feel\na little nostalgic.
I couldn't just leave you.
I did what I could.
I didn't want to make the\nnormies suspicious, so I fled\nbefore they could notice.
I do love baseball.\nI really do!
I do wonder what you think\nof the country life...
I don't even remember sending\nthem, to be honest.
I don't have that problem with\nyou though, do I, Sensei?
I don't have the ingredients.
I don't have to go out,\nand I can really take my time\nto think and choose!
I don't know how she did it.\nWhy'd they turn out so well?
I don't know how you do it...
I don't know if I'd call them\nhobbies, though. More like\ndreams or ambitions.
I don't know where this power\ncomes from, and I never really\nthought about it until now.
I don't know yet what\ntruly matters.
I don't know...
I don't mean like right now.\nI'll be at my usual spot, so\ncome by if you've got time.
I don't mind at all.
I don't really know either.
I don't see much of a point\nto all these machines.
I don't think I'll be able\nto help out for a while.
I dug it up from the darkest\ndepths of the web. I'm sure\nit's the real thing.
I dunno about my skin, though.\nIt made mine almost a bit\ntoo pale, know what I mean?
I dunno about that...
I dunno, I tried playing\nmy friend's bass\nback in the day.
I dunno, that seems kinda far.
I even bought this recording\nsoftware that all the pros\nuse. It was pretty pricey tbh!
I even have alcohol-free\ndays so I can really\ngive it my all.
I expect no less from a leader\nlike you! Once you lock on,\nyou never lose your target!
I feel better after talking\nto you, Sensei.
I feel like every time\nwe see each other,\nyou end up helping me out.
I feel like I am able to fully\nunderstand your feelings.
I feel like I generate\na lot of power when\nI admire someone.
I feel like I made things\npretty awkward...
I feel like there's no way\nI can't make some\ngreat music now!
I feel more confident talking\nit out with you though.
I feel refreshed now that\nI've let it all out.
I figured it would be best to\njust put it all behind me.
I figured maybe they could\ngive me a few hints.
I finished my new\nsong lyrics!
I forgot that was a thing.
I found a ton of unopened ones\nwhen I was cleaning out\nmy closet.
I found someone to take my\nspare baseball equipment!
I gave myself to the rhythm.
I get excited thinking about\nhow it'll make my food better.\nI just can't stop.
I get that, but...
I get that.
I get the feels when I recall\nall the fun times I had while\nplaying baseball.
I got a frantic message from\nMotoha. She was like...
I got a new smartphone!
I got mad and sad.\nDragged you here\nand there, Sensei...
I guess I gotta put in the\neffort if I wanna become the\nperson I view myself to be.
I guess I'm starting to\npick up her speaking habits...
I guess it's all about social\nmedia these days. Nobody sends\nfriends emails anymore, right?
I guess it's weird to say I'm\nlooking forward to it, but,\nuh, I actually kind of am!
I guess practice paid off.
I guess that's just the price\nI gotta pay to do what I love.\nI'll pay it off soon enough.
I guess that's what\nmatters most.
I guess there is still much to be done...
I guess they want you to pick.
I guess, yeah.
I guess?
I had him try the best bowl\nof ramen I could make.
I had no idea that there were\npeople who prefer it without.
I had to get my glasses after\nI hit the books too hard.
I had to help out injured\nold folks, lost children...
I happened to see a girl\nplaying the guitar on\nthe streets of Shibuya.
I have a couple products.
I have a lot of free time\nthese days when my hubby\nis off at work.
I have a real hard time\ncompartmentalizing things.
I have an owl, actually.
I have discovered a magic\nspell that charms people.
I have made a full recovery!
I have no idea what\napps are worth having.\nThere's too many...
I have researched the duties\nof a producer.
I have seen that same\npotential in you.
I have stuff to do.
I have to take a supplementary\ntest for math soon.
I have to wonder why more\npeople don't take notice...
I have to write this report\nfor uni...
I have utmost faith in\nyour capabilities.
I have?
I haven't been able to learn\na single thing in class\nall day because of it.
I haven't been able to\nsleep well lately.
I haven't been to the batting\ncages in forever, either.
I haven't done it yet.
I haven't heard anything\nfrom her yet.
I hear there is a saying:\n"What one likes,\none does well."
I heard from Masa-san.
I heard Kotone-san called the\nmusic club over yesterday.
I heard that live-action hero\nshows are made for children.
I heard that stable\ntemperatures produce\nsourer fruit.
I heard that there are a lot\nof electronics stores there!
I highly recommend you\nfollow Naruru's example.
I hope that attracts more\nteenagers like you and\nothers who can't drink.
I hope you stay that way!
I hope you two keep on\ngetting along!
I hope you won't follow in my\nfootsteps once you're older.\nDrink responsibly!
I imagine most people wouldn't\nrecognize him by name alone.
I just dropped Tomoko off\nat home.
I just found out\nabout it today...
I just had to text you\nabout it.
I just heard something pretty\nincredible... Can I tell you?
I just need some time\non my own.
I just order whatever I want.
I just saw the gibberish\nI sent you last time.
I just throw stuff on rice.
I just wanted to try it out.
I kind of get it now.
I kind of stumbled into it...
I knew it wasn't the time\nor place to approach her.
I knew that you'd understand.
I knew you had good sense,\nHero of Light.
I know a lot happened with\nhim, but things seem to have\nworked out.
I know Chinese and\nJapanese supermarkets\nsell different stuff.
I know it's a bit strange\nfor an old legend like that\nto be popular now...
I know it's a little late,\nbut thank you for helping\nout Leo-chan.
I know that this is\nout of the blue
I know they'll just tell me\nanything's good if I ask...
I know we'll be gone a while,\nbut make sure to eat properly,\nokay dear?
I know you are!\nYou're my first and most\nimportant fan after all.
I know you can't drink,\nbut you should come\nto the bar sometime.
I know, right!?\nEspecially since I struggled\na lot with the last one.
I know, right? I can't let\nmyself lose to some gramps!
I know, right? They're so\nfloofy and cute!
I let it slip that I was\na big fan, and, well...
I like arts and crafts.
I like spending time with you.
I like to keep up-to-date with\nwhat customers like. Ttyl.
I like you the way you are.
I look forward to our\ncontinued partnership.
I look so young it's like I'm\nback in high school again!
I lost myself for a bit.
I love petting animals,\nbut caring for one is so\nmuch work, you know?
I made sure to keep everything\nthat was important to me.
I make a pretty mean omelette.
I managed to save up some of\nmy paycheck, so I bought some\npro recording equipment...
I may have done something...
I may have found a shop that\nlooks super useful to help us\ninfiltrate the palace.
I mean, I could barely\neven move when we\nwere in the Metaverse!
I mean, that's true, I am\na chosen one, but still!
I might make my fair share\nof messes going forward.
I might still have some\ncostumes back home.\nI can teach you!
I might try next time I go.
I must clarify that this excursion\nis not bound by the terms of\nour contract. What do you say?
I need time to prepare.
I need to check my schedule.
I need to check out a student\nhot spot. Can you come?
I need to have full control\nover my emotions. Is that\ncalled a poker face?
I need to know...\nWhat fascinating news!\nI must do more research!
I need to throw my weight into\nbeing a Phantom Thief.
I need to try raw egg\nover rice!
I need to try this out.
I need to work on\nmy self-restraint.
I never thought I'd end up\nthinking this way.
I only did what any fan would.
I only worry about whether\nor not they're picking up\nwhat I'm putting down.
I passed by an arcade and saw\none when I peeked inside.
I prefer cats.
I promise to have\nyour back... so be sure\nto give it your all.
I ran into him last time\nI went in. Right in\nthe courtyard!
I ran past the baseball team\nduring my run today.
I realized something super\nimportant when I spoke with\nsome school friends today.
I really mean it!
I really wanna know exactly\nwhat it is they came for.
I recall telling you\nsome time back
I saw a photo of it\nonline, remember?
I saw us in an interview!
I say it's fine to have\nnoodles for all three meals.
I see that you have grown\neven stronger.
I see!
I see. Thanks!
I see. Yeah, now that you\nmention it, you might\nbe right.
I see... All I gotta do is\njust exercise more to\ncompensate?
I see... That makes sense.
I sense a newfound desire\nrising within me.
I shall brief you on the\ndetails of this proposal\nwhen we meet in person.
I should be able to cook up\nsomething interesting.
I should investigate\nlive-action heroes further.
I start slacking with\nthe housework when\nI'm by myself.
I still go to the hospital for\nregular checkups, right?
I suggest we find the\nanswer together.
I suppose I can't deny\nthe possibility.
I suppose I have something\nof an eye for talent.
I suppose it would work\nif the three were to\nform a group...
I sure have.
I taught her a bunch of stuff\nwhen we used to play baseball.
I think I'd be relaxed.
I think I'll start with some\neasy-to-serve items.
I think I'm going to try\ntranslating a grimoire soon.
I think so too. Kiuchi changed\na lot faster than we expected.
I think that could work.
I think this unit could work.
I think...
I thought about it, but\nI was on my own.
I thought about it\non my travels...
I thought I knew what\npeople thought of me.
I thought I was getting\na little out of shape.
I thought my heart was gonna\npop out of my chest.
I thought our work as Phantom\nThieves would've made me more\nresilient to this kinda stuff.
I thought that me dropping out\nsuddenly caused huge problems.
I told my mom about you\nat dinner today.
I told you all the recording\nequipment I ordered\nshowed up, right?
I treasure them.
I tried making my own homemade\nseasoned bamboo shoots.
I tried some ramen at this\nrun-down Chinese restaurant.
I understand wanting to\nact like a bad boy, though.\nIn fact, it's a relief!
I use a different method.
I use my computer to keep\nin touch with Mama.
I used to be a serious collector.
I used to have more stamina\nwhen I was in college...\nProbably because I did dance.
I used to put fake tan on all\nthe time back in high school.
I usually feel super groggy\nin the morning.
I vote courage.
I wanna come up with catchy\nriffs like that myself too
I wanna see your videos!
I wanna see youuu!
I wanna try making\nmocktails that appeal\nto younger customers.
I want to create the best\nflavor experience I can\nfor my customers.
I want to hear it!
I want to see.
I want to watch myself from my\ncustomers' perspective, to see\nif I need to work on anything.
I wanted to impress you.
I wanted to watch an action\nmovie, so I subscribed to a\nstreaming service.
I was concerned that you might\nnot log on during exam season.
I was exploring a mysterious\nbookstore when I came across\nan old book covered in dust.
I was getting lonely\nonly talking to you\nin that world.
I was going to refuse\nthe position at first
I was just curious is all!\nThanks for humoring me.
I was looking it up earlier.
I was pondering on the notion\nof Naruru and her coworkers\nbecoming an idol group.
I was so captivated!\nIt was really good!
I was thinking it might\nbe nice to dance again.
I was thinking of doing\nsomething a little different\nthis time... Care to join me?
I was thinking of studying\nat the diner.
I was thinking of studying\nfor that quiz tomorrow...
I was waiting for you\nto say that!
I was wondering if I could ask\nyou for some advice myself.
I was wondering if we could\nmeet up and I could talk\nto you about it.
I was wondering what\nMagatsushin would post,\nbut this...
I went a bit too hard with my\nflair bartending practice and\nnow my limbs are killing me...
I went to go cheer on my old\nbaseball team the other day!
I will also have to look into\nthese "live-action effects."
I will in a few years.
I will, I will.
I wish for you to become\nan adult filled with such\na bountiful desire.
I wish I could say things the\nbest way possible\u2014or at least\nbe nice about it.
I wish nothing but happiness\nfor both you and Naruru.
I wish you'd come by\nmy work more!
I wonder if I'll even be able\nto work properly tomorrow...\nSorry, just wanted to vent!
I wonder if my parents felt\nthe same way I do now.
I wonder if they still\nhave codes that unlock\nsecret frames...
I wonder what you'd be like\nif you got drunk.
I wonder which.
I would like to wish you\na happy birthday.
I wouldn't go that far...
I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't say regret.
I'd always thought you\nwere just a regular kid\nin the neighborhood...
I'd better make an appointment\nnow. See you tomorrow!
I'd go for it.
I'd hate to throw it out, but\nif I can't find any takers...
I'd like to meet you IRL.
I'd like to see her play.
I'd like to try.
I'd like to visit your room!
I'd like to visit.
I'd look just like the old me\nif they'd let me adjust the\nmakeup and skin a little...
I'd love to check them out\nsometime. It'd be a whole lot\neasier than going to Hakata.
I'd love to go check out\nHakata and the Goto Islands\nsometime!
I'd love to hear about your\ntraining regimen sometime.
I'd love to join in next time.
I'd probably go off the walls.
I'd rather forge on ahead and\nembrace the embarrassment.
I'd spend hours watching\nvideos online until recently.
I'll be counting on you\nto show me around.
I'll be right there.
I'll be sure to let you know\nhow it goes.
I'll be waiting in the\nclassroom, so be sure\nto come, okay?
I'll buy a whole bunch\nand see for myself!
I'll consider it as training\nmy mental fortitude.
I'll find some new clothes\nfor you, then. Something to\nlook forward to!
I'll get back to you when\nI figure it out.
I'll give it some thought.\nThanks for hearing me out!
I'll give you some pointers.
I'll hand you my phone\nthe next time you're here.\nHelp me out, will you?
I'll have to get back to you.
I'll have to go see what\nyour town looks like!
I'll have to put in some more\ntime with my guitar if I wanna\nkeep up with you!
I'll just stick with Yui.\nPlain and simple.
I'll let you know if we make\nany progress!
I'll let you try what\nI've come up with\nnext time you're here!
I'll make sure not to\nput any on yours.
I'll make the best bowl of\nramen to go with this pork.
I'll make up for it with\nmore workouts!
I'll meet you at the usual\nplace in Yongen-Jaya!
I'll negotiate with it.
I'll reach out when the next\ntest period's coming up!
I'll see if I can find any\ngood restaurants nearby.
I'll share my thoughts once\nI've given them a watch.
I'll show it to you\nwhen I'm finished.
I'll show you how to do them.
I'll teach you.
I'll think up a bunch of tasty\nmocktail recipes!
I'll throw the sugar in\nhalf at a time.
I'll try talking to the owner\nand the other bartenders.
I'll try to help you\nas much as I can!
I'll whip you into shape!
I'm a bit worried...
I'm a pro.
I'm about to send my thoughts\ndirectly into your mind...
I'm actually heading out\nshopping soon. But it's gonna\nbe quite a trek...
I'm actually looking for one\nright now.
I'm all set.
I'm alone for a while, yeah.
I'm already grown up.
I'm amazed by your knowledge.
I'm at the diner right now,\nso if you're free, I could\nreally use your help!
I'm bad with jokes.
I'm being serious!
I'm bored out of my mind.\nTell me a joke!
I'm curious about them, too.
I'm doing fine.
I'm down.
I'm finally learning how\nlackadaisical I can be.
I'm fine, I have friends.
I'm getting more excited\nby the minute!
I'm glad I asked!\nI like mine with salt.
I'm glad I came to you\nfor advice. Thank you!
I'm glad I could help.
I'm glad I talked it out\nwith you.
I'm going to do whatever\nI can to level up!
I'm going to make up for\nall the frustration I've been\nmade to feel!
I'm gonna give it my all\ntomorrow too! Talk soon!
I'm gonna go unpack\neverything now. I can't\nwait to try it all out!
I'm gonna keep at it\nfor my street shows!
I'm gonna try a few\nstrategies out.
I'm good to go whenever,\nso hit me up when you\nwanna search Mementos!
I'm grateful for it.
I'm grateful to you too.
I'm impressed.
I'm in a good mood and\nthought I'd text you!
I'm just a bit worried about\nyou since we won't be back for\na while.
I'm just a little stuck on the\nsong I'm writing right now.
I'm just glad to see\nyou do act your age\nevery now and then.
I'm just listening.
I'm just living my life.
I'm kind of curious now.
I'm listening.
I'm looking forward to\ndrinking with you someday.
I'm making the most of my time\nhere in Japan, but sometimes\nmy studies take a back seat...
I'm missing some tools.
I'm not drunk tonight!
I'm not familiar with it.
I'm not so worried about\ngrades that I'd try to pay my\nway out.
I'm not sure... Spirits aren't\nusually visible to the\nhuman eye, after all.
I'm not that kind of person.\nDon't get the wrong idea!
I'm not the only one out there\nwith a short fuse, huh?
I'm off to try somethin' new\nto develop my palate.\nWanna tag along?
I'm really excited to make\nsome new music.
I'm really glad I got to\nmeet him.
I'm really grateful.
I'm researching how to develop\ntelepathic abilities.
I'm so glad to hear you\nsay that! Well, then here's\nto even more meddling!
I'm spinning too! Haha! Whee!
I'm starting to think\na full meal would sell\nbetter than snacks.
I'm still in the middle\nof my studies.
I'm still in the middle\nof my studies...
I'm super curious to learn\nmore about your taste!
I'm super grateful.\nI'll thank you properly later!
I'm sure drunk me would\nbe happy to hear that.
I'm sure it will.
I'm sure they'll be thrilled.
I'm terrible at math, too.
I'm the one who'll be\nin trouble if I don't,\nafter all.
I'm the only one who struggles\nto keep it cool!?
I'm the same!
I'm thinking up some\nnew recipes, so this'll help\ngive me some ideas.
I'm thinking we should add\nmore mocktails to the menu.
I'm very VERY sorry you\nhad to deal with that...
I'm well aware that I have\ntrouble speaking kindly\nor subtly.
I'm with you on that one!\nThat's the right call,\nno matter how you slice it.
I'm worried it will get in the\nway of my true purpose.
I'm your fan too.
I'm... not terrible, I think.
I've added a lot of mocktail\nrecipes to my repertoire.
I've already got my alias,\nby the way.
I've always been the kind of\nperson to want to stand next\nto the one I admire.
I've been a housewife for\na while now after meeting\nmy hubby, of course.
I've been going to Inokashira\nPark a lot to practice singing\nand playing at the same time.
I've been helping him\npack his things.
I've been looking up\nthe amount of calories\nin different foods.
I've been practicing at home.
I've been taking secret notes\nfor some time now, haha.
I've been testing out\nrecording my flair bartending\npractice from various angles.
I've been thinking about\nstuff. Mind hearing me out?
I've been wondering...
I've been worried about my\nskin lately. I'm usually\ncareful with it, but still!
I've given it great thought.
I've got a report due soon for\none of my worst classes.
I've got it covered.
I've got to pass this time\nand restore my honor!
I've gotta let them decide\non their own what's best.
I've heard of people from my\nhomeland who made the trek to\nJapan in search of something.
I've heard there are tons\nof shops there!
I've never been all that great\nat talking to others.
I've never been into them.\nMaybe I should give them\na chance.
I've never had to ask\nsomeone for something\nlike this before.
I've never owned my own store,\nso I'm not sure.
I-It really is the real thing,\nI swear! Or I wouldn't ask\nyou to watch it with me.
Idol group fan?
If a menu's got fries,\nthey'll always end up\non my tray.
If anything, it was a spirit\nof guidance, not luck.
If I didn't talk it out with\nyou, I'd still be struggling.
If I hadn't quit the team,\nthat could've been me\npracticing in the field.
If I have, it's thanks to you.
If I hear anything more\nfrom them, I'll make sure\nyou're the first to know!
If I just change my attitude,\nthen maybe everything will\nstart sticking in my head?
If I want my customers to be\ntruly satisfied...
If I'm being honest, I'm not\ngood at holding my tongue...
If I'm going to be\na Phantom Thief...
If I'm happy with them,\nI'll let you try some.
If I'm super bored.
If it's all true, that'd be\npretty incredible,\ndon't you think?
If not, then awesome!
If possible, I should\ninvestigate her life\npre-hiatus.
If so, then maybe Japanese\npeople have always been\nreluctant to hit the books...
If speaking my mind\nmakes someone hate me,\nthen I'll be the bad guy.
If that's that case, then...
If that's the case, I should\njust suck it up and accept it.
If there's anything I can do\nto help, just say the word!
If we rent the place out,\nLufel can finally eat his\nroast pork and stewed eggs.
If you could give me tips,\nI'd appreciate it...
If you don't get something,\nfeel free to ask me for help\nanytime.
If you don't mind,\nI hope you'll keep\nlending me an ear.
If you have any trouble,\nyou can always talk to\nthe neighbors, okay?
If you have no regrets, sure.
If you miss the hourly bus,\nyou'd better be prepared\nto get biking!
If you place four dolls with\ndifferent expressions in the\ncorners of a room at midnight...
If you say so.
If you see me there again,\nfeel free to say hi!
If you've got time later on,\nlet's discuss which ones\nto check out!
Imagine two bowls of ramen,\none's perfect, one's not.
In any case, let us not\nworry over such details!
In fact, I just finished doing\nit. I hope a demon appears.\nActually, maybe not...
In my idol research, I have\ndiscovered an incredibly\nenchanting individual.
In one of my lectures, I heard\nthat the Chinese first arrived\nin Japan centuries ago.
In other words, I wasn't\nseriously considering the\nperson I was talking to.
In other words, she is\nan employee there.
In other words, the fate of\nan idol's career depends\non them.
In other words, they've put\ntheir faith in me?
In places with convenience\nstores around practically\nevery corner...
In Shibuya.
In that case, forget about\nwhat I said back then!
Including what others saw in\nchoosing to settle here.
Intriguing, right? My senses\nare tingling... It's like I'm\nbeing drawn in...
Is it really cursed?
Is it?
Is she talking about how\nI get riled up like this?
Is that being childish!?
Is that how it works?
Is that right?
Is that useful?
Is that what people who\ndon't drink tend to prefer?
Is there any way to delete it?\nOh, I hate how all this stuff\nstays on your phone!
Is there anything you want to\ndo besides farming, Russet?
Is there someone you admire?
Is this a shopping list?
Isn't that all a bit much?
Isn't the world of\nhorticulture just so\ndeep and fascinating!
Issue is, my mom moved them\naround a bunch.
It can't be easy, right?
It definitely is.
It feels like you're clearly\nolder than me in spirit.
It felt as if both\nidols and fans shared\none heart and mind.
It got me going to a burger\nshop for the first time\nin what must be forever.
It happened back when\nI was a wee sprout!
It happens when foreign foods\nare introduced to a country,\nand locals adapt the flavors.
It happens.
It is I who should be\nthanking you.
It is pointless for\na concierge to sing\nher own praises.
It is required to\nfulfill our contract.\nPlease do not neglect it.
It is times like these when\none's loyalty is tested.
It looks super interesting.
It made a huge impact, huh?
It made me curious to know\nwhat movies my other friends\nare watching.
It made me wonder whether that\nnuance exists in Japanese too.
It makes sense now. Thanks.
It might have grown into\na whole other issue\nif you weren't around.
It only took half my life...
It opens a gate to another\nworld. Or so they say...
It really doesn't.
It reminded me of the first\ntime I sung with my band.
It reminds me of when I\nwas younger and finally\nleaving home.
It seemed kinda mystical\nonce I started thinking\nabout it.
It seems many idols appear in\nthem before rising to fame.
It sounds like she's awfully\nbusy with practice, anyway.
It sure did!
It took being on the receiving\nend of it to finally realize\nwhat I was doing.
It was a popular ghost story\nway back in the day.
It was a real nail-biter.\nThey eked out a draw\nsomehow...
It was funny.
It was honestly pathetic...
It was nothing, really.
It was only a matter of time\nuntil I harnessed my powers.
It was so CUTE!
It will take some time\nfor his change of heart\nto be reflected in reality...
It won't get them any closer\nto understanding where\nI'm coming from.
It would've been better if I'd\nfigured this all out before\nI came to study, sure.
It'd be cool to play\nwith you sometime.
It'd help with your work.
It's a good thing I checked\nto be sure!
It's a little confusing, but I\nfind it real interesting.
It's a matter of restraint.
It's a modern-day ghost story,\nbut about a dog-faced man,\nnot a man-faced dog!
It's a pretty interesting\nconnection, don't you think?
It's a promise!
It's a symbol of my resolve\nto take music seriously\nfrom now on!
It's about the dog-faced man\ncase I mentioned before.
It's all still boxed up\nright now, though...
It's amazing that you're\nable to live alone at\nsuch a young age.
It's basically training\nthat incorporates\nboxing techniques...
It's because of you that\nI can stay positive
It's been a while since I read\nthat demon-summoning spell.
It's been getting real popular\nthese days. Want to go try\nsome together next time?
It's been quite some time\nsince I became your concierge.
It's been working great.\nMy sleep's never been better!
It's easier than it looks.
It's easy to go overboard\nwithout realizing.
It's fine, really!
It's fun talking with you.
It's fun to look this\nstuff up, you know?
It's fun!
It's giving me too many ideas.\nI want to try out everything.
It's good that you went.
It's hard for me to figure out\nwhat to prioritize here.
It's hard to put into words.
It's harder for me to just\nwing it and not give a damn.
It's high time I stepped up\nto your expectations!
It's interesting to see things\nfrom that point of view.
It's just... it was my first\ntime hearing strangers\ncall themselves fans of mine
It's kinda short notice...
It's like a nonstop\npunch to the feels.
It's like that for everyone.
It's like time just melts away\nthe minute I'm watching vids\nof other peoples' pets!
It's like we're living our\nbest lives every day!
It's like with no warning,\nsome random thought appears\nand totally consumes my brain.
It's like you say, Sensei.\nThis has been a good\nlearning experience for me.
It's Motoha!
It's new, but it's a little on\nthe small side. Besides...
It's no surprise that some\npeople dream of escaping\nto the countryside.
It's not a big deal\nor anything
It's not a dream.
It's not an optical illusion?
It's not as if I go round\nseasoning my coworkers'\nlunches at the office!
It's not easy...
It's not for long, but our\nplace just feels so big when\nit's just me, you know?
It's not the closest one,\nbut they're selling cartons\nof eggs for 99 yen!
It's not wise to reveal your\ntrue name in enemy territory.
It's okay to dream.
It's only fair if I tell you\nwhat I thought of you, too!
It's probably been edited.
It's quite useful for online\ndata collection, too.
It's reassuring to hear you\nsay that, Sensei!
It's slander, and it's taking\na real toll...
It's surprising how there's\nso much more to common words\nthan we think, right?
It's the perfect place to go\nto busk it out, y'know?
It's the roasted pork recipe\nI mentioned before.
It's the same reason everyone\ntalks about Menaces.
It's true! There's a photo\nof a guy with a dog's head\ndriving a car!
Japan sure loves its vending\nmachines, doesn't it?
Japan takes that to a whole\nother level.
Japanese authors have always\nbeen good at making the\nmundane sound so interesting.
Japanese loanword, right?
Japanese people have a\nreputation for being polite,\nand I think so too.
Just as people once found\ngods within nature,
Just because I'm a resident\nof this virtual world...
Just burn it off.
Just call me sensei.
Just doing my part.
Just felt like sharing that.\nAnyway, catch ya soon.
Just get 'em online.
Just get a late train slip.
Just kidding. I'm responsible;\nI won't let it go to my head.
Just let me know when\nyou have the time.
Just picturing the numbers\non my next bank statement\nis making me depressed...
Just some plants.
Just take it slow, okay?
Just venting your feelings\nwon't help anything.
Just watch me!\nI don't need a new name to\nshow you how I've changed!
Just watch me. I'm doing this!
Kayo-san's been asking you for\nadvice on all kinds of stuff,\nright?
Keep talking...
Kinda busy right now.
Kinda strange, really.\nI'd eat all that meat...
Kinda weird, right?
Know what a phone charm is?
Knowing you as well as I do,\nI knew you wouldn't\ndisappoint!
Kotone-san, performing to\nthe song I chose...
Last week's math homework
Lately, I've been taking\nthis boxercise class\nat the gym I'm going to.
Lately, I've been trying my\nhand at making a bunch of\nnew cocktails and mocktails.
Lately, my mom's been\nasking about you.
Lay a good one on me.
Learning how to use it took\nsome time, but these modern\nphones are amazing, huh?
Leave it to me, partner.
Leek, dried sardines,\nbonito, kelp, garlic,\nginger, celery.
Left unchecked, however,\nit invites ruin upon oneself\nand others.
Lemme get back to you.
Lemme know if you\nfind more, yeah?
Let me check my schedule.
Let me know when you've\ngot some time!
Let me know your other movie\nrecs too. We can catch a flick\non the big screen next time.
Let's ask Yamagoshi-san.\nMaybe this time Lufel can eat\nroast pork and stewed eggs.
Let's both give solo life\neverything we've got, ok?
Let's farm together forever.
Let's get stronger together.
Let's go shopping\ntogether sometime!
Let's save Naruru.
Let's see. Well, the word for\n"study" in Japanese can mean\n"reluctance" in Chinese.
Light.
Like a record.
Like at a gym? I guess, but I\nfind it hard to stay motivated\nwhen working out alone...
Like code names?
Like it's my job.
Like Motoha and\nmy teammates...
Like us.
Like with the Sahara Desert,\n"Sahara" just means desert.
Like, soybeans?
Like, when you drink mocktails\nwith me, you have to go home\nbefore it's too late, right?
Live action is a door to\nsuccess for many hopeful\nactors and idols.
Look at me, forcing my own\nopinions onto others...
Look forward to my findings!\nHehehe.
Looking forward to next time!
Looks like I still have\na ways to go.
Love you, sweetie.
Lucky for the guy, it turned\nout to be delicious and had\na great shelf life.
Made a group chat so we can\nget in touch easily!
Make sure you're eating\nenough, okay?
Makes me feel welcome.
Making sure you give\na youngster the space\nthey need is hard...
Mandarins prefer\nwarmer climates.
Mandarins.
Many of our regulars are\nfriends with the owner.
Mariyan?
Math class is so hard.\nNone of it's making\nany sense to me.
Maybe all these jobs\nare keeping my eyes\nin peak condition...
Maybe an e-reader app?
Maybe he's taking a back seat?
Maybe hearing you play\nwhat you like made me\nenjoy it even more?
Maybe I was aiming too high\nwith the bar menu.
Maybe I'll take my hubby\non a date, and we can go\nto one together next time.
Maybe I'll try reaching out\nto some friends from my\nstudent days for a change.
Maybe it's about not\ntrying too hard. Is that\nwhy it's good?
Maybe it's the same endless\ncycle regardless of age.
Maybe schoolwork is\nthe same then?
Maybe the other instruments\nare getting added in post, or\nyou're using a synth keyboard?
Maybe training might help?
Maybe you read it wrong?
Maybe you'll even\nstart bawling?
Maybe you've changed.
Me, I'd go for anything that\nkeeps me moisturized.
Me? Teaching?
Meant to send it to my mom.
Met Pops the other day.\nIt's been forever.
Might as well make the most\nof having the whole house\nto yourself, right?
Might grow some plants...
Might I suggest taking on\nsome tougher Trials from\nthe Sea of Souls?
Mind if I ask you something?
Mind if I pick your brain?
Mind showing me again?\nWhen you have time, of course!
Mine aren't.
Mint tea is lovely in the\nwarmer months, you know.
Mobile games.
Modern photo booths amaze me!
Most of my repertoire\nconsists of bar snacks.\nI don't cook at home at all.
Most seem to grow out of it\nas they age.
Motoha didn't fail!
Much like an object of\nworship, an idol embodies the\ndesires of their believers.
Must be lonely when all the\nfans who knew you are gone...
Must be to make them\nremember what it's like\nto feel real wonder.
Must've been a fake grimoire.
Musubi and I can share a meal\nsince we're at her place!
Musubi's told me so many\nstories about her life\nin the countryside!
My apologies. My emotions\ngot the better of me.
My bad.
My belly flab's all gone!\nIt feels incredible.
My eyes clearly lack the\nability to see through such\nillusions. I must train more.
My eyesight was still pretty\ngood back when I was\nplaying baseball...
My first impression\nof you was...
My goal... Yeah, you're right.
My head's been in the clouds\nlately. I need to get it\ntogether.
My homeroom teacher is.
My hubby left on a work trip\ntoday too. I'm all alone.
My hubby's still out\non his work trip, so...
My impulse to speak my mind\ntakes the wheel.
My mom's on the night shift,\nso she might not be around.
My notebooks or my planner.
My place is nothing special,\nbut if you really want to...
My research has led me to\na popular title called\nPhoenix Ranger Featherman.
My sincerest apologies for\nmy loss of composure.
My, my... I really can't\ncompete with you.
My, you sound confident!
N-No, I'm not!\nI'm not scared,\nit's just...
Nah, forget it. I'm the adult\nhere. I can't be relying\non you all the time.
Nah, I mean regular soybeans.
Nah.
Nah. It's not like my\naccount is in danger of hitting\nzero or anything. It's just...
Near my house.
Needless to say, I hope you\nwill exercise due caution.
Nevertheless, please keep this\na secret from Naruru.
Next time, I would like you\nto reattempt the spell with\nthe pose for me.
Nice.
Night shifts, you know?
Nighty night!
Nngh... I need to pull\nmyself together.
No doubt.
No idea. I just heard\nsomeone yell it out.
No longer a fan of Naruru?
No matter. Another time, then.
No problem.\nI'll be at my usual spot\nif you're free.
No way. You know too?
No wonder they're\nall falling apart!
No, actually I continued\nreading the book after that.
No, I didn't.
No, no, it's just with an\nindie label. No big break\nfor me yet.
No, thank you for stopping by!
No. In fact...
None of our ideas stood out.\nNot really, anyway.
None of us can stomach it,\nnot even the guys who\ncooked it!
Noodles count as a\nstaple food, yeah?
Nope! It's Fall.\nOnly four letters!
Nope, train was just late.\nJust my luck lol.\nActually slept like a log.
Normally, I just sit and\nlet her talk my ear off.
Not a demon?
Not a lot of girls trying out\nfor catcher these days.
Not everything is spicy,\nyou know! Different regions\nhave their own flavors.
Not exactly next door\nneighbors, when you\nthink about it.
Not gonna lie,\nI kinda want to!
Not here in the virtual world?
Not in particular.
Not only do I talk straight,\nbut I don't care what\npeople think of me.
Not sure. There's so much\nmore I need to learn about\nthis country.
Not that I can think of...
Not that I know of.
Not virtually,\nI mean in real life.
Nothin' out of the ordinary.
Nothing in particular...
Nothing wrong with crying.
Now her idol career shines\nbrighter than ever.
Now I can face my Mama\nwith pride, and tell her\nmy studies are going A-OK!
Now I feel like I've gained\nweight from all the\ntaste-testing I'm doing.
Now I want to take even\nmore photos, y'know?
Now the fun begins!
Now we can finally\nstart searching for\nthe next Palace, right?
Of course I know the\nbasics of numerology,\nbut equations...
Of course I'll go.
Of course you were.
Of course! Even I was\na child once, you know.
Of course! I haven't been\ndoing all of this for nothing.
Of course, if you want to talk\nabout real life, I'm all ears!
Of course, parents are never\nable to fully understand how\ntheir children feel either...
Of course, that may simply be\nmy own misconception.
Of course, you'd never be able\nto care for an animal if you\ncan't even care for plants.
Oh btw, I forgot to ask\nearlier, but...
Oh come on! You're supposed\nto agree to join me!
Oh no... I was trapped in an\nendless cream soda mind loop!
Oh right. That makes sense.
Oh yeah!\nA lady of class always remains\ncalm and collected.
Oh yeah, I heard riding the\ntrain all the way to Hakata\nis brutal on the ole keister.
Oh yeah, she did say\nshe'll get some tickets\nto the competition!
Oh! Bass is pretty hard\nthough! That's impressive.
Oh! That's kids these days\nfor you.
Oh, and did you eat today?\nMake sure you're eating\nwell-balanced meals, okay?
Oh, and you know what\nthe record company rep\nsaid to me?
Oh, but I do want to go\nwith my hubby first...
Oh, good idea! All three of us\nfor the next study session.
Oh, great idea. Apparently\nyou can even read magazines\non your phone now!
Oh, I guess I answered my\nown question already, huh?
Oh, I guess they're a little\nold-school.
Oh, I had a feeling\nyou'd say that!
Oh, I see!
Oh, I see! If it's a synth\nkeyboard, then I guess you\nfour could manage with that.
Oh, I see. Ping me next time\nyou're available.
Oh, I see... Let's do it\nanother time, then.
Oh, I see.\nSame here, actually.
Oh, I think you might be onto\nsomething there. Thanks!
Oh, I'll use the one we played\nwhen I would step up to bat.
Oh, I'm being a bit of a\nwet blanket now, aren't I?\nSorry, forget I said anything!
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have\nrevealed myself?
Oh, it was just a thought.\nMaybe I'm totally\noff the mark.
Oh, no, it's nothing serious.\nMy body's just aching\nall over.
Oh, of course! Your phone\ncase! Yeah, that does seem\nlike the trend these days.
Oh, okay.\nMaybe some other time.
Oh, really!? Phew, maybe I'll\ndo the same, then.
Oh, really?\nI'm sorry about that.
Oh, right! I'll take you\nto one of our suppliers\nnext time.
Oh, right. The music club came\nto support the game, too!
Oh, sorry! I'm the one who's\nfalling short here, I know.
Oh, stop it. Although\nI suppose a little praise\nis nice... Heh.
Oh, sure. Yeah, I guess that\nmakes sense.
Oh, that'd work!\nI bet I'll find someone\nwho wants it!
Oh, the luster of youth!\nI'm jealous that your skin\ncan look so good.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
Oh, you're always so smooth.
Oh, you're so pure!
Oh-ho! I thought so.
Oh. My bad.
Oh... The demon didn't appear,\nand I thought a lucky spirit\nwould be more useful anyway.
Oh? So I was right.
Ohmigosh, this takes me back!\nIt's like I've actually turned\nback the clock or something.
Okay, but!
Okay. See you guys on\nthe roof.
Okay. See you guys tonight at\nHeritage Kitchen then!
On my phone.
On my way.
On that note,\nsee you tomorrow!
On the other hand, mandarins\ngrow well in warm climates!
Once I figured it out,\nour study session was\na breeze!
Once she absorbs a technique,\nMotoha never forgets it.
Once we recreate my hometown\nin the virtual world...
Once you're a grown-up though,\nwe can drink the night away.
One step closer to adulthood.
One that'll pump her up.
Ones by famous directors!
Ones that make your\nskin smooth, improve\ncirculation, etc.
Only if you pay.
Only the best quality.
Ooh, how mysterious!\nI'm actually pretty jealous.
Ooh, I could see how\na bright, fragrant bath\ncould lift your mood.
Ooh, I like it!\nI bet it'd even help\nspruce up dinner!
Ooh, I'd really like to try\nyour cooking some time.
Ooh, maybe I should become\nyour full-time stylist next!
Oooh, I'm so excited!
Oooh, so that's what\nthey're called! Filters!
Oooh, that's where\nMusubi works!
Oops, so I guess you were\nthe one looking after me?
Or at least, I think so.
Or perhaps what we see now\nis his true character.
Or rather, it is guaranteed\nto succeed.
Or so I'd like to say, but...
Our class president is\ntransferring at the end\nof the month...
Our contract is\nproceeding smoothly.
Our keyboardist works hard.
Our purpose is to open\nthe eyes of the masses!
Our telepathic powers are sure\nto awaken in time!
P.S.
Papa was the one who insisted\nI study abroad...
Pay no mind to\nthose messages!
People still ferment stuff.\nHell, we're getting better\nat it.
People would attach a bunch\nof them to their flip phones.
Perhaps I'm complimenting you\nway too much!
Perhaps that is a way of\nstealing desires...
Perhaps, but that is also\nentirely thanks to you.
Phoenix Ranger Featherman\napparently has many\ninstallments.
Please give live action a try\nwhen you have the chance.
Please ignore my prior\ncareless remarks.
Please recite along.
Please use the Phantom Idols\nto their fullest potential.
Please!
Please, I'm begging you.\nLet me copy your homework!
Plus, apartments that\nlet you play music indoors\ndon't come cheap...
Plus, I'd be at a disadvantage\nif I didn't know the rules\nof baseball.
Pops says the latter is\njust right.
Pretty amazing, huh?
Prince?
Probably tomorrow?
Promise you'll have your\nfirst drink with me?
Proud of you!
Put it on my phone case.
Put some games on it.
Queen of all bartenders!
Raising a child was so much\nwork. I was relieved when\nit was over, but...
Ramen.
Random.
Ready to start writing songs?
Really!? Thank you so much!
Really? I didn't know that!\nI'll give that a go tonight.
Really? I had no idea.
Really? I was expecting you\nto say no! Aww, I'm so happy!\nJust leave it to me!
Really? I'm glad to hear that.
Really? That makes me feel\nbetter.
Really? That's too bad. Maybe when\nyou have some time, okay?
Really? Wow, luckyyy!
Really? You couldn't?
Really? You're a lifesaver!
Recently, I've been watching\ntons of dance videos online.
Regretting your purchases?
Remember that bit you\nfreestyled in our last\njam sesh together?
Remember that recording\nequipment I blew my\npaycheck on?
Remember what I told you\nabout the word "soy"?
Reply later
Right on my phone case.
Right! He was super happy\nto sign one for me.
Right, since alcohol isn't\nthe focus, I could serve the\nmocktails as part of a meal.
Right, so...
Right, you do need some\nspecific ones. I'll take you\nshopping next time!
Right, you must be pretty\nbusy. No rush, just let me\nknow when you have time.
Right. You can't grow up if\nall you care about is whether\nor not you think it's fair.
Right... I guess I'll start by\nuncovering its mystery.
Right... I guess that\nmakes sense.
Right... yeah. There is\nsomething that I've been\nmulling over.
Right? Glad you agree.
Right? I was thinking\nthe same!
Right? Thanks!
Romance.
Rumor has it there's an\nabandoned building near\nour school that's cursed.
Said it's been forever since I\ntalked about a classmate.
Same here.
Says who?
Secret frames?
See you there.
See you tomorrow.
See youuuuuu!
Seems like you and Leo-chan\nare getting along well, hm?
Sell it at a flea market!
Shall we watch it later?\nWe need to see what\nit's all about!
She asked them to do a studio\nrecording of the song.
She can skate to that...?
She does most of the talking.
She said you're a\nhigh schooler, Russet!
She wants to be a pro player\nwhen she grows up!
She was cute.
She was shocked.
She wore not her con caf\xe9\nattire. Instead, it was a\nconvenience store uniform.
She's not the real deal?
She's still getting the same\nnasty comments as before...
She's treating me to dinner!
Shiyurin?
Shoot! Did we wake you up?
Shouldn't I just make what\nthe customers want to eat?
Shouldn't take too long.
Sign up now and get\na free plot of land!
Since I decided to become\na Phantom Thief, I've been\ndoing some thinking...
Since I've been training\na lot lately...
Since our visit to Akihabara,\nI have looked into\n"concept caf\xe9s."
Since we're the chosen ones...
Sleep well, everyone.\nSee you at school.\nGoodnight.
Smartphones are so handy,\nright? You can watch videos\nand record videos of your own.
So doing it all in one trip\nwouldn't be much different\nto two trips. Hmm...
So even though I'm done with\nthe lyrics, I'll have to put\nthe melody writing on hold...
So he opened the shop back\nup.
So how about it? Wanna form\na duo and debut with me?
So I ended up as the interim\nclass president.
So I guess things haven't\nchanged. Okay, onto my\nbudget planner they go!
So I imagine I've got plenty\nof cringey moments ahead\nof me\u2014and failures, to boot.
So I made sure to focus all\nmy positive energy into it\nbefore handing it off.
So I need a cup of tea\nto force my gears to\nstart turning.
So I think the purpose of\nchosen ones like us...
So I wanted to say thanks.
So I was out busking\nin Shibuya
So I was performing in\nShibuya today, right?
So I was thinking about taking\nup some kind of hobby myself.
So I was thinking of using\nyour style as a point of\nreference for my new look.
So I was wondering if\nyou might be able to\ninstruct me
So I've decided to get back\ninto exercising.
So I've kinda been wondering\nhow you go about it...
So if you have the time,\ndo you think you could be\nmy workout buddy?
so it kinda got me\nall hyped up!
So it's even more tiring...
So let's chat via IMs\nfrom time to time\nas well!
So make sure to call me\nPrince of Darkness\nfrom now on, Hero of Light!
So many things to buy...
So now they're in the market\nfor some taste testers...
So she's working there?
so thanks.
So that's how kids these days\nthink about things...
So the change of heart worked.
So the day has finally come...
So there's another way!?\nYou've got to tell me\nabout it!
So tomorrow after school.
So we'll get to eat both\nPops's and Masa-san's ramen.\nWanna go?
So you do? Now that's\nquite something.
So you might be wondering\nhow we're eating together...
So you understand, then?
So! I've saved up quite a bit\nfrom my part-time jobs.
So, about that autograph?
So, about that song I asked\nthe music club to perform\nfor Kotone-san.
So, I asked them about making\na song to cheer on Kotone-san.
So, I got all the devices\nhooked up to start\ncomposing and recording.
So, I saw this ad on TV.
So, I tried to remember how I\nwent about things back then.
So, I'm still working at\nthat diner in Shibuya.
So, that thing you taught me\nthe other day... I can't seem\nto get it right on my own.
So, you were able to\nsense my emotions?
So... about what Musubi\nsaid about you being\na high schooler...
So... it's that tasty, huh.
Soda's got you trapped.
Some countries do.
Some of them only use the\nupper body. Maybe I could use\nthem in my flair bartending.
Some of us would even hide\nphotos of our crush inside\nour phone's battery case.
Someone outside the classroom\nrandomly yelled...
Something filling sounds nice.
Something from the heart!
Something I've never tried\nbefore, hm? I wonder what\nthat could be.
Something like... working out?
Something refreshing.
Something sweet.
something totally unrelated\nwill just pop into my head.
Sometimes I think about you...
Sometimes, when I'm\nworking on a guitar lick\nor my backlog of housework
Songs that pump me up.
Soon enough, Naruru will\njoin their ranks...
Sooo, I just had to think\nabout how she took\nthe information in.
Sorry about the joke.
Sorry for bringing up such a\nspicy, uh, dicey proposition!
Sorry for suddenly logging out\nlast time.
Sorry for the sudden text.\nDo you have a second?
Sorry for the weird question!\nSee ya tomorrow!
Sorry if that was random!\nBut no real reason...
Sorry, I can't divulge that.
Sorry, I'm busy.
Sorry, just wanted to update\nyou. Thanks for listening.
Sorry, kinda busy...
Sorry. I know this is totally\ncoming out of nowhere...
Sorry...
Sorry... I'm good at reading,\nbut speaking is a bit rough.
Sorry... I'm just venting\nmore than anything.
Sounds good to me!
Sounds interesting.
Sounds kind of familiar.
Sounds like a great goal.
Sounds like he was admitted.\nHe is pretty old, after all.
Sounds like work...
Sounds unreal.
Sounds wise.
Speaking of rehearsals though,\nyou've got some mad tambourine\nskills, too.
Speaking of the park
Speaking of which, Japan is\nchock-full of hot springs.
Spoke to a guy from class...
SQUEE!!!
Staying on top of everything\nwhen it's just you is tougher\nthan I imagined.
Still, can you even\nbelieve it?
Still, I have full confidence\nthat your skill is not\nto blame.
Still, it's a hospital.\nI can't just barge in\non him.
Still, thanks for making this\nwhole thing into a fun memory.
Still, there must be\nsome way, right?
Still, when it comes to\ntalking about nothing,
Stray cats!?
Such a task is elementary\nfor you. Be diligent.
Summer?
Support Naruru further,\nand our contract will\nproceed swimmingly.
Sure am, haha! But I'm glad to\nhear you say that, thanks.
Sure can!
Sure do.
Sure, can't go wrong with\nice cream or almond jelly.
Sure, I can help.
Sure, no problem.
Sure...
Take any good pictures?
Take care!
Take it slow and steady.\nThat is what is most\nimportant.
Taking pics with my hubby\nwas fun, but I don't have\nanywhere to display them.
Talkin' to you made me realize\nthat all this time, all I had\nto do was just wing it.
Talking to you never fails\nto motivate me.
Tell me.
Th-That's the name of\nmy old guild! The Office!
Thank yooouuu! I'd feel much\nmore comfortable using one\nwith someone younger with me.
Thank you again for your\nassistance with Naruru.
Thank you for asking. I got\nhome safe and I'm about to\nturn in.
Thank you for the\nrecommendation!
Thank you! It's just a small\nindie label, but still.
Thank you! Sorry this\nis so short notice...
Thank you.\nThat's very kind of you.
Thanks a lot. I'll let the\nmusic club know!
Thanks again! I'll get back to\nyou when I'm done watching.
Thanks for always listening\nto my randomness.
Thanks for always putting up\nwith me. I hope I'm not\nannoying you.
Thanks for everything!\nLet's give it our all\ntomorrow, too!
Thanks for listening to me.\nI'll catch you later.
Thanks for listening to my\nwhining. I'll let you know\nwhen my gear arrives!
Thanks for listening.
Thanks for replying though!\nI was so terribly bored!
Thanks for the show.
Thanks for your input!
Thanks so much!\nYou've been a huge help!
Thanks! But Motoha's the one\nwho put in all the work.
Thanks! I'll be waiting\noutside the diner.
Thanks! Look forward\nto my next song, okay!
Thanks! Night!
Thanks! You're a lifesaver!
Thanks, but maybe save the\ncongrats for Motoha.
Thanks, but...
Thanks, I'll give it a little\nmore thought, then.
Thanks, I'll see\nwhat's around.
Thanks, Motoha.
Thanks, you've been\na big help!
Thanks. I'll return the\nfavor sometime.
Thanks... Now I can finally\nget to the song writing part!
That alone is the\nunshakeable truth.
That became soy in English.\nIt's why we call 'em soybeans.
That counts as studying!
That first time you listened\nto me sing in the park
that I can't be in the\nsame place as Musubi.
That is a concierge's duty.\nI will persevere.
That is pretty incredible!
That is really sudden.
That makes it a pretty\ndifficult instrument, I think.
That means one for you too,\nof course. We should go\nsee it! Together, I mean.
That only supports her\nargument that I'm childish!
That reminds me.\nSome of my furniture,\nand even tools are broken.
That said, we're not a\nrestaurant. We can't\nmake anything too fancy.
That settles it! We'll meet at\nHeritage Kitchen tonight!
That sounds fun.
That sounds wonderful!\nAll that color, right outside\nmy window!
That stuff on etymology?
That villainous producer had\na complete change of heart.
That way, I sure won't forget\nwhat I've learned.
That you might be forcing\nyourself to spend time\nwith me.
That you seem pretty...\nabsent-minded?
That you were interesting.
That'd be great!
That'd be quite the trip.
That's 'cause it's your hobby.
That's a relief, though.
That's all real world\nbusiness, so I'll ask\nMusubi to go!
That's all right, it doesn't\nneed to be now. Just when\nyou have time, Sensei.
That's due the day\nafter tomorrow, right?
That's exactly it! Children\nnever really get how much their\nparents love them.
That's exactly why fermented\nfoods are cool, if you ask me.
That's fine, no pressure.\nIf you happen to have time,\nyou know where I am.
That's great!
That's greeeat! I'm so happy.\nThose are actually pretty\nnice pieces, you know.
That's how I used\nto think, anyway.
That's how you get the\nmarinade to taste so good.
That's it?
That's okay for now.
That's okay, it doesn't have\nto be right now. I'll be at my\nusual spot if you're free.
That's okay, just when you\nhave time. I'm sure you're\nbusy with other things, too.
That's one worry down for\nole Yaoling. Thanks a bunch!
That's pretty heavy.
That's probably why I tend to\nbe a bit too watchful when it\ncomes to you.
That's random.
That's really nice of you.
That's right, you bought\na desk, didn't you? You must\nlike handiwork? Cool!
That's the right thing to do.
That's the same thing as\ngiving up and running from\nthe conversation.
That's the spirit, Sensei!\nIt'll be a great experience,\nfor sure.
That's too bad.\nMaybe another time!
That's true. I guess\nevery instrument just\ntakes practice.
That's what "admire" means.
That's what I'm wondering.
That's what it means to\nbe the one having to watch\na young one leave the nest.
That's why he was\nso surprised, huh.
That's why I can't help but\nfind it so incredible.
That's why I started working\nout not too long ago.
The "Erimo" in Cape Erimo\nmeans "cape" in Ainu.
The basil grew very well.
The best bowl is just\na means to an end.
The biggest thing about the\ntype of person I want to be...
The cameras are way better\nthan the digital cameras\nwe had back in the day.
The coach and everyone\non the team invited me\nto come watch.
The convenience store's close.
The demon could manifest here\nat any moment...
The eggs they sell in this\ncountry are safe to eat raw.
The fan appreciation event\nwas truly splendid.
The girl named Narumi\nreferred to her establishment\nas an "idol con caf\xe9."
The guy who gets bullied?
The gym has other courses too.\nThey're so much better than\njust running on a treadmill!
The information age sure\nmade it hard to separate\nfact from fiction.
The ingredients and seasonings\nare a bit different from\nChinese food here in Japan.
The line cooks went all out,\nand made some crazy dishes.
The noodles and soup\nwere nothing special.
The old man who ran\nthe place told me how\nto make the marinade.
The only thing that mattered\nto me was...
The other day, I happened\nto see Naruru.
The other day, she even asked\nme to bring you along.
The pay's gotta be good.
The performers hid their\nfaces, so I could not tell\nwho they were.
The person with the\nhead of a dog!
The picture just overlapped\nthe driver and his dog.
The process of fusion and\nskill inheritance undoubtfully\ndemonstrates its complexity...
The ramen I just had went\nheavy on the fat.
The reason I can strive\nso hard now is because\nof the person I admire.
The reviews say you'll be\ncaught in an endless cycle\nof tears and laughter.
The roast pork?\nWhenever you want.
The salt incident\nI mentioned earlier...
The same concept applies to\nsupporting one's idol.
The savings aren't that much.
The second time, I won't let\nit dissolve completely.
The strays that live there\nhave started coming over\nto listen to my songs.
the sweeter and redder\nthe fruits!
The telltale signs of\nan oversleeper. But hey,\nthat's why we're friends.
The thing about being a mom is\nthat you start worrying over\nkids who aren't yours, too.
The thing is... I can't get\nthat lick you played out\nof my head.
The thought just popped\ninto my head, so I thought\nI'd let you know. Take care!
The type to protect and defend\nwhat I believe in?
The uneven distribution\nof flavor is what made it\nso delicious.
The way you say something\nis important, of course.
The what?
The wonders of fermentation.
The words are so small\nand hard to read though...\nIs it time I got glasses?
The world's spinning\nround and round!
Their anniversary's coming up\ntoo, so it's good timing.
Their names end with -man.
Then I guess I'll have to\ncome up with something\nnext time!
Then I shall await you\nin front of the Velvet Room.
Then I wish for you\nto accompany me\nnext time.
Then I'll see you online!
Then it was my turn to\nanswer, but I didn't know\nwhat to say.
Then it's a whole other flight\nor boat ride to the islands...
Then there's all the bugs...
Then you might not log on much\nduring exams.
Then, this is a bit\nembarrassing, but...
There are all sorts of egg\ndishes where I come from.
There are miraculous things\nto be found everywhere\nyou look.
There are so many flavors and\nrecipes I want to try out.
There is another ritual I want\nto try next time, though.
There is currently an outbreak\nof potato moles! For those\nof you with farms, be careful.
There is much depth to taking\na photo with your idol.
There was an article\nabout Kotone-san.
There was even a Chinese\nsettlement in the Hakata ward\nof Kyushu 1000 years ago!
There was this one time we had\nto perform something right out\nof The Arabian Nights.
There was this really cool guy\nwhen I was out running\nthis morning.
There's a huge difference\nwith how others see me\nand how I see myself.
There's a huge sale at the\nsupermarket right now!
There's a new movie out\non the streaming service\nI signed up to.
There's actually a whole ritual\nbehind it.
There's an easier way.
There's more important things.
There's more where that came\nfrom if you're interested!
There's no point in playing\nthe blame game.
There's no turning back!\nBehold! The new Yui is here!
There's no way I can sum up\na major life question in\n50 words or less.
There's so many of them,\nthough... I wonder if there\nare any good ones.
There's someplace I'd like\nto go with you. If you\nhave the time, of course.
There's something bothering\nme, I guess...
There's something I wanted to\nask you about. Do you have\nsome time to spare?
There's something\nI would really appreciate\nyour help with.
They act as an idol's mentor\nand key partner.
They all go down smoothly.
They always have. Though that\ncat from last time at the park\nwas one I see pretty often.
They are reliable allies.
They brought it to Europe as\n"soya" in the 17th century.
They came out perfect!\nI took them with my hubby!
They didn't work out?
They even adjust the size\nof your eyes and the length\nof your legs now!
They have Chinatowns not only\nin Yokohama, but Kobe and\nNagasaki, too.
They held a contest for their\nhot n' spicy original menu.
They may both be fruits,\nbut their needs are different!
They messaged me earlier\ntelling me how nerve-racking\nit was.
They must be the ones\nto decide how to enjoy\ntheir meal.
They really have an app\nfor everything now, too.\nI can't believe it!
They told me they were fans!
They were talking about\ndating your best friend.
They're all old people too.\nI'm glad we're getting more\ncustomers younger than me.
They're called Rangers.
They're easy to use.
They're even more convenient!
They're no use to me anymore.\nI need to buy new ones!
They're nothing like\nthe booths we had when\nI was growing up.
They're perfect.
They're so much bigger than\nthe ones I remember using.
Things got tense between us.
Things have come full circle.
Think you could come along\nwith me today...?
Thinking about life.
This again...?
This clearly requires\nfurther investigation.
This is a message from\nthe admin of Harvest\nWorld Online.
This is to better understand\nyou and other humans.
This might take a while. Could\nwe meet outside in a bit?
This reminds me a lot\nof what we used to do\nwhen I was at school!
This requires further\ninvestigation. I'll let you\nknow if I find anything.
This too is proof of your\ntremendous growth.
This whole thing with\nYukimi-san...
This world is full\nof curiosities...
Those are their nicknames.\nPlease memorize them.
Those bamboo shoots I made\nthe other day...
Those people just love talking\nabout dating, you know.
Though I am a Sichuan girl.\nThat tongue-numbing heat\nis right up my alley.
Though I do not loathe\nthe notion.
Though there are some things\nI've felt like wanting to do\none day!
Though they may be products\nof cognition, they possess the\nstrength of a Phantom Thief.
Time to enjoy a nice,\nice-cold cream soda!
Time to experiment.
To further our contract,\nplease learn to be more\nlike her.
To possess desire without\nyielding to it... That is my\nsincere wish for you.
To think someone sealed away\nthe right food for a while and\ninvented a tasty snack... Wow!
To think that our faces\nwould end up on live TV!\nWhat a great find.
Tomoko just told me\nthe same thing.
Tomoko said I'm still like\na kid sometimes.
Too bad, but no worries. Let's go some\nother time, okay?
Too bad... It was an apple.
Totally relatable,\nif you ask me.
Totally.
Train's fault, so you're safe.
Try Akihabara.
Try eating dinner early.
Try teaching by example.
Try the convenience store.
Trying to decide on which song\nto perform was tough.
Turned out better than I ever\nthought they would.
Turns out there are\nloads of them.
Ugh, complaining to you\ndoesn't get me anywhere.
Ugh, I can't believe myself...
Ugh, I can't take it anymore!
Uh oh, I think I'm gonna be\nlate for school.
Uh, I guess I still don't\ncompletely get it.
Uh, it's due tomorrow.
Uh, okay.
Uh-huh?
Um... Well, I can't play\nanymore, right?
Um... You know what, forget\nI said anything! I'm asking\ntoo much of you.
Umm, that's top secret.
Understood. Do let me know if\nyou are interested, should you\nnot have other arrangements.
Until recently, I've always\nspent my free time hanging\nwith friends.
Until then, I can only\ncontinue to support\nNaruru as a fan.
Use any good filters?
Very well. I shall be at my\nusual place, so just let me\nknow if you're interested.
Very well. I shall do so\non the next occasion.
Wait, don't just apologize!
Wait, is that really how\npeople see me?
Wait, no! I didn't mean it\nlike that!
Wait, what about your\nhomework?
Wait.
Walking around the city\nmade me realize something...
Wanna dash to a diner?
Want to try Harvest World\nOnline? It's free to play!
Warming up your feet helps.
Was hoping to ask you a favor.
Was there a problem?
Wasn't sure what they meant\nby authentic Chinese food\nthe first time I heard it.
Watching a cast of young,\ninexperienced actors
Watching videos online.
We all even had to make\nmatching costumes.\nIt took a lot of work.
We chosen ones are embroiled\nin a never-ending battle to\nstay informed, so to speak.
We chosen ones must strive\nto fulfill our purpose\nhowever we can!
We did it!
We don't need babysitting...
We fans have found our dreams\nin idols like Naruru.
We got interviewed?
We have to do all these quick\nmoves, but it's super fun!
We must search for intel in\nprint and online ensure our\nknowledge is kept up-to-date.
We need aliases.
We need cover stories to\nprotect our real identities.
We should all eat lunch\ntogether sometime!
We should go to one together.
we should go to there\nagain sometime!
We should have an emotional\nendurance contest to see\nwho can last the longest!
We still have a ways to go\nbefore that, though!
We'd just drink?
We'd stick them all over these\nspecial photo albums we bought\nor trade them with each other.
We'll be sure to bring you\nback some souvenirs, so look\nforward to it.
We're always discussing food!
We're both guys, so...
We're talking about pets here!\nI suppose you do still have to\nraise them, but still...
We've become acquainted as I\ncontinue to visit Naruru.
We've just arrived at the\nairport.
Well I managed to find\nthat same image again.
Well now I want to try\neven harder!
Well then, it seems my support\nhas been worthwhile.
Well then, let's focus on\nexpanding our fields!
Well, apparently a pro\nbaseball player from\nway back is there!
Well, apparently she uploaded\nit to a video site, and that's\nhow the record label found me.
Well, either way. Thanks for\nall the advice! I'll message\nyou again later, okay?
Well, I can say for sure that\nyou'd never do anything bad.
Well, I couldn't tell.
Well, I guess someone your age\nwouldn't know any different.\nAnother sign of the times...
Well, I was wearing my\ntracksuit, so I don't know\nif I want to show you that...
Well, I'm always free to chat.
Well, I'm glad I'm not\nthe only one...
Well, I'm never late...
Well, it's all here now!
Well, it's definitely not\nas convenient.
Well, it's very inconvenient\nfor school kids who don't\nhave a driver's license!
Well, Masa-san's stoppin' by\ntonight to celebrate Pops's\nrecovery.
Well, seems like my desire to\nlook after something hasn't\ncompletely gone away.
Well, since I asked...
Well, someone has it\nfigured out! I could learn\nfrom your example.
Well, we are close in age.
Well, you come off as serious.
Well... Yeah, there's some\nstuff that I don't do anymore.
Welp, I'm off to bed too then.\n'Night!
Welp, wish me luck, Sensei!
Wh-What in the world?
Whaaat!? No, but this is about\ngetting a good deal!
What a cultured woman you are.
What a great day!
What about idols?
What about it?
What about the Hero of Light?\nHaha, I like it.\nIt's perfect...
What about you, Sensei?\nDo you eat a lot of\nraw egg with rice?
What about you? Do you clean?\nAre you making sure to eat?
What an honor.
What are you, his mom?
What brought this up?
What did you get?
What did you put for your\nanswer to the last question?
What did you tell her?
What dish would you choose to\nend a yakiniku course on?
What do kids these days even\ndo with the pictures they\ntake at photo booths anyway?
What do you discuss?
What do you mean,\n"surprisingly"!?
What do you think about me!?
What do you think about\nwhen you're playing bass?
What do you think would work\nfor cheering on Kotone-san?
What do you think\nof "Meow 3 Stars"\nfor a unit name?
What does it mean to "admire"?
What exactly makes someone\na live-action hero?
What I'm after isn't available\nnearby, you see. Wanna come\nwith me?
What kind of dishes\ndo you like to cook?
What kind of experiences\ndo you need to go through to\nend up as mature as you?
What kind of impediment?
What kinda music are you into?
What matters right now is\nhow good this pasta tastes\nwith basil!
What sort of movie is it?
What sorta bath salts\ndo you like, Sensei?
What was that again?
What was the question?
What were they talking about?
What would you do if you were\nin my position?
What's most important\nis how you act after\nall's said and done.
What's the point of searching\nfor my own flavor?
What's the shortest season\nof the year? Take a guess!
What's this recipe for?
Whatever I feel like!
Whatever I feel like...
Whatever, I'll just try some\nand find out! Thank you!
Wheeeeee!!!
When did you come to enjoy\nfarming this much?
When everyone was\non break today...
When I was workin',\nI'd bring up customers\nand coworkers.
When I'm feeling down
When in Japan, do as\nthe Japanese do, right!?
When we first met,\nwhat did you think of me?
When we performed that new\nsong, one of the fans took\na video on her phone, right?
When you're really trying to\nfix a problem, whose fault\nit is doesn't matter.
When're you making me some?
When's Miyazawa's change of\nheart supposed to happen?
Where are you now? Did you\ntalk to Kano-kun?
Where do you usually\ndo your shopping?
Where I'll land when\nthe dust settles.
Where you get your hair cut?
Where'd this all come from?
Where'd you hear that?
Where's this coming from?
Whether or not she is one\nmakes little to no difference.
Which basically means...\nI read an incantation to\nconjure some devilish fiend!
Which Featherman do you like?
Which is it?
Who are you, my mom?
Who dis?
Who knows, it might've been\na joke the first time someone\nsaid it.
Who's asking?
Why are fries so\nfreaking good?
Why didn't you say somethin'?\nI only just found out!
Why don't more people do that?
Why don't we do your\nneighborhood next?
Why not dance again?
Why not start now?
Why'd you pick\nthat instrument?
Why's that?
Will that really help?
Will they be enough?
Will you be just the way\nyou are? Will I get to see\na new side of you?
Winter?
With Mariyan and Shiyurin\non either side...
With your help, I have\nno doubt this issue\nwill be resolved.
Within the virtual world,\nI mean!
Without thinking,\nI accidentally read a\nline from it out loud...
Without you, we would have\nlost her smile.
Work hard, eat hard!\nTwo birds with one stone!
Works for me.
would travel to and from China\non the regular.
Would you care to\nride one with me,\nat your next convenience?
Would you ever\ngive it a try, Sensei?
Would you like to hang out?\nI'd love to learn what teens\nare into these days.
Wouldn't call it a side dish.
Wouldn't it be great if there\nwas a photo booth that let\nyou look all nice and tan?
Wow, she's peppy.
Wow, you've gotten\npretty strong, huh?
Wrong number.
Wrong person.
Yay! I'll wait for you\noutside the diner!
Yeah! I usually give\na few pats to the ones\nI recognize.
Yeah! I'm actually heading\nto one right now.
Yeah! That, and I'm just\nso happy.
Yeah! We'd better do all we\ncan to cheer her on.
Yeah! What the heck was that?
Yeah! You can find me\nin Shibuya.
Yeah, a few hints and I should be able to do the rest on my own.
Yeah, brass band tends to be\npretty loud, so it'll be fine.
Yeah, but I feel like you\nwere the one who gave me\nthe strength to do it.
Yeah, but it's like...\nI'm older than you, y'know!
Yeah, but maybe that's\njust how I see you.
Yeah, fair enough. It's easier\nsaid than done, right?
Yeah, I agree.\nThat takes guts of steel.
Yeah, I can very easily\nimagine that!
Yeah, I could just say\nI'm studying by living\neveryday life!
Yeah, I got to hear tons of\ngreat tales about his heyday.
Yeah, I guess some stores\nfinish off with rice soup.
Yeah, I guess you are a\nstudent. Not having your folks\naround must have its perks.
Yeah, I heard that movie\ntakes you on an emotional\nroller-coaster.
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah, I sure got taught\na valuable lesson.
Yeah, I went wild with them!\nIt's like I was a high school\ngirl again!
Yeah, I'm kinda curious.
Yeah, I'm talkin' about food.
Yeah, it sure is.
Yeah, it's close to my school.
Yeah, it's not about forcing\nmy best onto the customers.
Yeah, makes no sense. He just\nseemed to dump everything in a\nbowl and serve it up. So...
Yeah, me neither. How do you\ngo from laughing to crying\nso quickly?
Yeah, my bad. But when I think\nabout it seriously\u2014and I mean\nreally seriously...
Yeah, quite a lot lately.
Yeah, sorta.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, that seems like you.
Yeah, that's another one!\nThere must be more.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, they are pretty easy.\nAnd healthy to boot.
Yeah, you took the words\nright out of my mouth!
Yeah. I feel better now.\nThanks for listening.
Yeah. I'll nail this taste\ndown, all right.
Yeah. I've been looking\ninto it more.
Yeah. Pops is doin' a lot\nbetter lately.
Yeah... Glad to hear that,\nbut you're making me blush.
Yeah... I'll be fine. It's not\nlike my account's in danger\nof hitting zero or anything.
Yeah? Guess I can wait\na little longer.
Yep, I'd definitely regret it.\nFor sure.
YES!
Yes, exactly. You get\nwhat I'm saying?
Yes... Now that I've spoken\nto you, I'm prepared.
Yesterday alone, I ran into\nfive different people I had\nto save... I'm exhausted.
You a talent scout now?
You all good now?
You also have a great\nsense of humor.
You and Tomoko know me better\nthan I know myself.
You are meant to be like an\nidol, much like I am a fan.
You are most welcome.
You are too kind.\nI am grateful enough\nas your concierge.
You bet I do.
You can be a handful.
You care about fashion?
You could work out.
You didn't take any pics?
You didn't think I was\nweird or annoying?
You do have a point, though.\nI should get in a workout\nor two somehow!
You don't have any pets\nat home, do you?
You don't see any sweetened\ngreen teas in Japan, now that\nI think about it.
You figured it out.
You give good advice on\nmore than just training.
You have a point.
You have a ways to go?
You have good sense of style,\nand you blend in so well\nwith normies.
You have no idea how happy\nI am to hear that!
You ignored me? Ouch.
You just seem like you've got\neverything under control.
You just want to convert me.
You know how bartending\nis a standing job, right?
You know it.
You know the origin\nof the word "soy"?
You know, I learned\na bunch of different\ndances back in college.
You know, I think I'm\nstarting to get some idea\nof what I could try!
You know, if you were older...
You know, the first guy to\ntry out fermented food...
You know, they even\nhave dance courses\nlike jazz and hula.
You know, those ten pages\nin the workbook?
You know, what we've eaten\nand where we've gone.
You know... I thought I was\nover it when I had to quit\nplaying baseball.
You lifted yourself up.
You like your ramen\nlight or heavy?
You live in Zoshigaya, right?
You look fine to me.
You may be the quiet type,\nbut I know there's a lot going\non in that mind of yours.
You may rest assured!
You miss baseball?
You must be good at English.
You need guts of steel for\nsomething like this. I mean,\nmy manager literally fainted.
You okay there?
You really ought to prioritize\nyour studies.
You really read my mind\njust now!
You regret quitting?
You see, I haven't really\nfelt like it since I broke\nmy shoulder...
You see, I'm rather curious\nabout these Ferris Wheels.
You should do something rich.
You should go ask your mom\nif you don't know what I'm\ntalking about.
You should trust your taste.
You should try horror.
You should try something new.
You should try them all out.
You shoulda said hi!
You sure like to study.
You surprised me.
You take things so seriously.
You there?\nWakey-wakey!\n\xa1Buenos d\xedas!
You too, huh...\nIsn't it weird!?
You two free tonight?\nWanna hit up Pops's shop?
You wanna go check it out\nwith me?
You wanna go there now?
You watch it first.
You were cute.
You were once a wee sprout?
You won't have to worry\nabout me anymore!
You'd be doing me a favor!
You'd get tired of it.
You'd have to catch a flight\nto get from Hakata to\nthe islands, right?
You'll likely meet more\ncritters than fellow\ncountryfolk!
