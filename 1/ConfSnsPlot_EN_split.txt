I know we'll be gone a while,\nbut make sure to eat properly,\nokay dear?
We've just arrived at the\nairport.
I can't remember the last time\nI went on a trip with your\nfather...
We'll be sure to bring you\nback some souvenirs, so look\nforward to it.
And we've left you some money\nto cover any expenses,\nso don't go wasting it.
If you have any trouble,\nyou can always talk to\nthe neighbors, okay?
And don't forget to lock up\nwhen you leave the house!
Hey! Is this {NAME2}-kun?
It's Motoha!
Haha. Hilarious.
You're goofier than I thought.
Right, so...
I may have found a shop that\nlooks super useful to help us\ninfiltrate the palace.
Do you have time tomorrow\nafter school?
So tomorrow after school.
At Central Street, 'kay?
Are you okay? The house\ndoesn't feel too empty,\ndoes it?
By the way, feel free to use\nwhatever's in the fridge if\nyou feel like cooking.
And remember to water the\nplants outside.
The thought just popped\ninto my head, so I thought\nI'd let you know. Take care!
Good morning! It's morning\nthere, isn't it?
I'm just a bit worried about\nyou since we won't be back for\na while.
Make sure you're eating\nenough, okay?
I just dropped Tomoko off\nat home.
Now we can finally\nstart searching for\nthe next Palace, right?
I'm good to go whenever,\nso hit me up when you\nwanna search Mementos!
Hey Leader, I got a favor to\nask you.
I'll be waiting in the\nclassroom, so be sure\nto come, okay?
Made a group chat so we can\nget in touch easily!
Great, thanks!
Oh btw, I forgot to ask\nearlier, but...
When's Miyazawa's change of\nheart supposed to happen?
I think so too. Kiuchi changed\na lot faster than we expected.
Really? That makes me feel\nbetter.
All right, I'm goin' to\nbed then.
Wait, what about your\nhomework?
I did what I could.
'Night, guys.
He definitely didn't do it.
Welp, I'm off to bed too then.\n'Night!
I heard from Masa-san.
A message came through\nMiyazawa's manager apologizing\nto Victory Kitchen.
And the rights to the shop\nwere returned to Pops.
But I can't relax till I hear\nit straight from the horse's\nmouth.
Apparently he's holding an\nemergency press conference\nthis afternoon.
Tomoko just told me\nthe same thing.
Do you guys wanna watch the\npress conference together at\nlunch?
Okay. See you guys on\nthe roof.

Where are you now? Did you\ntalk to Kano-kun?
Can you come back to the\nclassroom? There's something\nyou should see.
Cool. Try to hurry, okay?
I added Riko-senpai to our\nchat group!
Thanks, Motoha.
How ya feelin', Senpai?
Thank you for asking. I got\nhome safe and I'm about to\nturn in.
Shoot! Did we wake you up?
Good night! Sleep tight!
It's fine, really!
But I'll take your suggestion\nand look forward to continuing\nour chat tomorrow.
Sleep well, everyone.\nSee you at school.\nGoodnight.
Thanks! Night!
Nighty night!
You two free tonight?\nWanna hit up Pops's shop?
Heritage Kitchen?\nIn Zoshigaya?
Yeah. Pops is doin' a lot\nbetter lately.
So he opened the shop back\nup.
Why didn't you say somethin'?\nI only just found out!
Well, {NAME2}'s house is\nclose to the shop.
Oh right. That makes sense.
Well, Masa-san's stoppin' by\ntonight to celebrate Pops's\nrecovery.
So we'll get to eat both\nPops's and Masa-san's ramen.\nWanna go?
YES!
That was fast!\nWhat about you, {NAME2}?
That settles it! We'll meet at\nHeritage Kitchen tonight!
If we rent the place out,\nLufel can finally eat his\nroast pork and stewed eggs.
Ah, if we rent it out,\npets might be okay.
Let's ask Yamagoshi-san.\nMaybe this time Lufel can eat\nroast pork and stewed eggs.
Okay. See you guys tonight at\nHeritage Kitchen then!
Did you see what's on\nDivine Justice?
Yeah! What the heck was that?
I was wondering what\nMagatsushin would post,\nbut this...
I'm not so worried about\ngrades that I'd try to pay my\nway out.
Yeah, you took the words\nright out of my mouth!
But even if it's a lie, it\nstill bothers me.
It's slander, and it's taking\na real toll...
Perhaps that is a way of\nstealing desires...
Are they just posting\nwhatever they want to try to\nwear me down?
Akashi is unbelievable...
Anyways, I've been called to\nthe faculty office. I need\nto go now.
Good luck! And stay safe!
Hey, uhh...\nare you busy lately?
Since I decided to become\na Phantom Thief, I've been\ndoing some thinking...
and I figured that I really\nneed to keep in shape.
So I've decided to get back\ninto exercising.
I mean, I could barely\neven move when we\nwere in the Metaverse!
It was honestly pathetic...
But I know that if I exercise\nby myself, I'm probably gonna\nslack off.
So if you have the time,\ndo you think you could be\nmy workout buddy?
Please!
Are you ready to\nenter Mementos?
I'm all set.
Do you think I could borrow\na moment of your time?
You see, I'm rather curious\nabout these Ferris Wheels.
Would you care to\nride one with me,\nat your next convenience?
I am pleased to hear that.\nI shall be waiting for you.
I happened to see a girl\nplaying the guitar on\nthe streets of Shibuya.
I believe she more than has\nthe potential to become\nan idol.
I suppose I have something\nof an eye for talent.
Then I wish for you\nto accompany me\nnext time.
I would like to wish you\na happy birthday.
You are most welcome.
I see that you have grown\neven stronger.
Might I suggest taking on\nsome tougher Trials from\nthe Sea of Souls?
Hey, you busy?
A new ramen place\nopened up near school.
And they're running\nthis opening promo.
You wanna go check it out\nwith me?
Great. Then let's plan\na day to go sometime!
Math class is so hard.\nNone of it's making\nany sense to me.
How am I gonna cope...?
Really? You're a lifesaver!
Well, I'm glad I'm not\nthe only one...
Hey, happy birthday!
Hope you have a great day!
Wow, you've gotten\npretty strong, huh?
How about hitting the batting\ncages after school?
Think you could come along\nwith me today...?
You wanna go there now?
I promise to have\nyour back... so be sure\nto give it your all.
There's something I wanted to\nask you about. Do you have\nsome time to spare?
Hey, I wanna talk to you\nabout something...
Just let me know when\nyou have the time.
{NAME2},\nyou take the train\nto school, right?
How do you usually\npass the time?
Oh, I see.\nSame here, actually.
Do you do anything else?
Something like... working out?
Hey, did you see the news\non TV just now?
I saw us in an interview!
For a split second,\nwe crossed behind the person\ngetting interviewed!
To think that our faces\nwould end up on live TV!\nWhat a great find.
There was this really cool guy\nwhen I was out running\nthis morning.
He's a one-hundred-year-old\ngrandpa who lives in the\nneighborhood.
He told me he's been\nrunning every morning\nfor ninety years!
I know, right? I can't let\nmyself lose to some gramps!
I wanted to watch an action\nmovie, so I subscribed to a\nstreaming service.
But almost all the films\nI wanted to watch aren't\navailable there anymore.
Do you have any\nrecommendations\nfor a good movie?
Huh, I had no idea you\nwatched romance flicks,\n{NAME2}.
I've never been into them.\nMaybe I should give them\na chance.
Horror? I kinda hate\njump scares...
But I guess if I'm gonna\nbe a Phantom Thief,\nI'll need some gall.
I'll consider it as training\nmy mental fortitude.
Thanks again! I'll get back to\nyou when I'm done watching.
Why are fries so\nfreaking good?
Since I've been training\na lot lately...
I've been looking up\nthe amount of calories\nin different foods.
French fries have waaay too\nmany. It made me so sad.
If a menu's got fries,\nthey'll always end up\non my tray.
I need to work on\nmy self-restraint.
I see... All I gotta do is\njust exercise more to\ncompensate?
Work hard, eat hard!\nTwo birds with one stone!
Last week's math homework
You know, those ten pages\nin the workbook?
That's due the day\nafter tomorrow, right?
Aaaaahhhhh!!!\nI knew it! Nooo!
That means you finished it,\nright, {NAME2}?
Please, I'm begging you.\nLet me copy your homework!
Yeah, a few hints and I should be able to do the rest on my own.
{NAME2}, my savior!\nI'm under your tutelage!
I'm super grateful.\nI'll thank you properly later!
I haven't been able to\nsleep well lately.
Got any ideas on how to\nimprove your sleep quality?
Really? I didn't know that!\nI'll give that a go tonight.
You give good advice on\nmore than just training.
I'm really glad\nyou're my coach,\n{NAME2}.
It's high time I stepped up\nto your expectations!
Don't worry about me,\nI've got this.
I'm gonna give it my all\ntomorrow too! Talk soon!
Uh oh, I think I'm gonna be\nlate for school.
Nope, train was just late.\nJust my luck lol.\nActually slept like a log.
{NAME2},\nremember the sleeping tip\nyou gave me?
It's been working great.\nMy sleep's never been better!
Didn't mean to get you\nall worried.
You're totally right!\nWhat am I worrying for?
My head's been in the clouds\nlately. I need to get it\ntogether.
I ran past the baseball team\nduring my run today.
If I hadn't quit the team,\nthat could've been me\npracticing in the field.
Hmm... I wouldn't say that.
I wouldn't say regret.
I get the feels when I recall\nall the fun times I had while\nplaying baseball.
And also...
I need to throw my weight into\nbeing a Phantom Thief.
It's like we're living our\nbest lives every day!
On that note,\nsee you tomorrow!
Hey, I know this is sudden...
What does it mean to "admire"?
I feel like I generate\na lot of power when\nI admire someone.
I've always been the kind of\nperson to want to stand next\nto the one I admire.
I don't know where this power\ncomes from, and I never really\nthought about it until now.
It seemed kinda mystical\nonce I started thinking\nabout it.
Umm, that's top secret.
The reason I can strive\nso hard now is because\nof the person I admire.
Huh? What do you mean\nthat's what it means?
Oh, I guess I answered my\nown question already, huh?
{NAME2},\nyou really are amazing.
Thanks for everything!\nLet's give it our all\ntomorrow, too!
{NAME2}!
What do you think about me!?
Wh-What in the world?
I'm being serious!
Tomoko said I'm still like\na kid sometimes.
I need you to tell me\nthat it isn't true,\n{NAME2}.
Is she talking about how\nI get riled up like this?
Is that being childish!?
Wait, don't just apologize!
That only supports her\nargument that I'm childish!
I thought I knew what\npeople thought of me.
But I was wrong.
You and Tomoko know me better\nthan I know myself.
Do you feel that way too,\n{NAME2}?
Hearing that makes me feel\na little better.
I get that, but...
There's a huge difference\nwith how others see me\nand how I see myself.
Ugh, complaining to you\ndoesn't get me anywhere.
I guess I gotta put in the\neffort if I wanna become the\nperson I view myself to be.
I can't seem to remember\nanything we learn at school.
But I can still remember\nall the rules in baseball.
Hmmm, come to think of it...\nit's more like the rules are\ningrained in my body.
For school, I have to\nsqueeze all the information\ninto my brain.
But when it comes to baseball,\nI guess they're infused with\nmy muscle memory?
You're probably right.\nIt's easier to remember\nwhat you like.
I can't recall important dates\nin history, but I'll never\nforget a friend's birthday.
Plus, I'd be at a disadvantage\nif I didn't know the rules\nof baseball.
Maybe schoolwork is\nthe same then?
If I just change my attitude,\nthen maybe everything will\nstart sticking in my head?
I'm gonna try a few\nstrategies out.
About today's modern lit\nhomework...
What did you put for your\nanswer to the last question?
"What kind of person do you\nwant to be in the future?"
"Answer in 50 words or less."
There's no way I can sum up\na major life question in\n50 words or less.
It's harder for me to just\nwing it and not give a damn.
But this may be the very\nanswer to the type of person\nI want to become.
The biggest thing about the\ntype of person I want to be...
The type to protect and defend\nwhat I believe in?
I feel like I can write this\nnow. Thanks, {NAME2}.
Hey, remember when I asked you\nfor film recommendations on\nthat streaming platform?
I was so captivated!\nIt was really good!
Didn't realize the story was\nso sad. I straight up cried\nat the end.
I thought our work as Phantom\nThieves would've made me more\nresilient to this kinda stuff.
Looks like I still have\na ways to go.
I feel refreshed now that\nI've let it all out.
Awesome. I'm always ready\nfor some coaching!
Let me know your other movie\nrecs too. We can catch a flick\non the big screen next time.
And that's a promise!
There's a new movie out\non the streaming service\nI signed up to.
It looks super interesting.
It's like a nonstop\npunch to the feels.
The reviews say you'll be\ncaught in an endless cycle\nof tears and laughter.
Yeah, me neither. How do you\ngo from laughing to crying\nso quickly?
Yeah, I heard that movie\ntakes you on an emotional\nroller-coaster.
If I'm going to be\na Phantom Thief...
I need to have full control\nover my emotions. Is that\ncalled a poker face?
Anyway, I'm going to\nput the show on now.
Lemme know when you've\nfinished watching it,\n{NAME2}.
We should have an emotional\nendurance contest to see\nwho can last the longest!
When everyone was\non break today...
Someone outside the classroom\nrandomly yelled...
"Cream Soda!"
No idea. I just heard\nsomeone yell it out.
But because of that...
All I can think about today\nis cream soda.
I haven't been able to learn\na single thing in class\nall day because of it.
Oh no... I was trapped in an\nendless cream soda mind loop!
Nngh... I need to pull\nmyself together.
Yeah! I'm actually heading\nto one right now.
Time to enjoy a nice,\nice-cold cream soda!
Thanks for always listening\nto my randomness.
Did you hear what everyone was\ntalking about in class today?
They were talking about\ndating your best friend.
Those people just love talking\nabout dating, you know.
Everyone had something to\nsay about whether they'd\ngive up or give in.
Then it was my turn to\nanswer, but I didn't know\nwhat to say.
{NAME2},\nwould you date\nyour best friend?
I see... You're a good\nfriend with a kind heart,\n{NAME2}.
I expect no less from a leader\nlike you! Once you lock on,\nyou never lose your target!
Fair enough. For some reason,\nthat makes me glad.
Sorry for the weird question!\nSee ya tomorrow!
Hey, you free now?
Was hoping to ask you a favor.
Awesome! Let's meet somewhere.
Oh, okay.\nMaybe some other time.
Didn't mean to put you\non the spot, sorry. Let me\nknow when you're free.
Did you see the commercial for\nthe new films that were just\nadded to that streaming site?
A bunch of them seem like\nthey'd totally be your thing!
If you've got time later on,\nlet's discuss which ones\nto check out!
Great! Well, you know\nwhere to find me!
No problem.\nI'll be at my usual spot\nif you're free.
Right, you must be pretty\nbusy. No rush, just let me\nknow when you have time.
Are you making proper use\nof the Phantom Idols?
Though they may be products\nof cognition, they possess the\nstrength of a Phantom Thief.
Your leadership will decide\nwhether they succeed or fail.
Well then, it seems my support\nhas been worthwhile.
Please use the Phantom Idols\nto their fullest potential.
Are you interested in idols?
From what I have observed,\nyou share many traits.
Much like an object of\nworship, an idol embodies the\ndesires of their believers.
I have seen that same\npotential in you.
I have discovered a magic\nspell that charms people.
As such, this charm has the\npotential to raise desire.
Please recite along.
I appear to be unaffected...\nThe inner workings of such a\nspell remain a mystery to me.
Still, I have full confidence\nthat your skill is not\nto blame.
Next time, I would like you\nto reattempt the spell with\nthe pose for me.
I have utmost faith in\nyour capabilities.
Since our visit to Akihabara,\nI have looked into\n"concept caf\xe9s."
The girl named Narumi\nreferred to her establishment\nas an "idol con caf\xe9."
In other words, she is\nan employee there.
I could sense a strong\nconviction within her.
At the very least, she has the\nqualities I seek in an idol.
Whether or not she is one\nmakes little to no difference.
I appreciate your\nunderstanding.
To further our contract,\nplease learn to be more\nlike her.
According to my research\non idol photo shoots...
There is much depth to taking\na photo with your idol.
How you greet her beforehand\nis of vital importance.
Your current mindset\nworries me terribly.
You are meant to be like an\nidol, much like I am a fan.
As the leader of the Phantom\nThieves, you must connect with\nyour allies and build trust.
I highly recommend you\nfollow Naruru's example.
Such a task is elementary\nfor you. Be diligent.
After our photo shoot\nthe other day...
I believe you've begun to\nunderstand Naruru's charm.
Take it slow and steady.\nThat is what is most\nimportant.
Our contract is\nproceeding smoothly.
I hear there is a saying:\n"What one likes,\none does well."
Support Naruru further,\nand our contract will\nproceed swimmingly.
For now, I shall welcome you\nas a fellow fan.
I can educate you on\nNaruru's charm another time.
Are you familiar with\nlive-action hero shows?
It seems many idols appear in\nthem before rising to fame.
I came across such a show\nwhile strolling Akihabara.
The performers hid their\nfaces, so I could not tell\nwho they were.
What exactly makes someone\na live-action hero?
I admit I am not familiar\nwith such names.
This clearly requires\nfurther investigation.
I will also have to look into\nthese "live-action effects."
I have researched the duties\nof a producer.
They act as an idol's mentor\nand key partner.
In other words, the fate of\nan idol's career depends\non them.
A corrupt producer can ruin\neven the most talented idol.
With your help, I have\nno doubt this issue\nwill be resolved.
It will take some time\nfor his change of heart\nto be reflected in reality...
Until then, I can only\ncontinue to support\nNaruru as a fan.
It is times like these when\none's loyalty is tested.
For now, it is vital that\nI "like" Naruru's posts on\nthe caf\xe9's social media.
The other day, I happened\nto see Naruru.
She wore not her con caf\xe9\nattire. Instead, it was a\nconvenience store uniform.
I knew it wasn't the time\nor place to approach her.
After all, I've learned\nprivate inquiries are taboo.
As such, I shall not even\nshare details of\nthe store's location.
I only did what any fan would.
All I can do now is pray for\nNaruru to find peace.
Do you recall our discussion\nabout live-action heroes?
My research has led me to\na popular title called\nPhoenix Ranger Featherman.
Live action is a door to\nsuccess for many hopeful\nactors and idols.
Soon enough, Naruru will\njoin their ranks...
I should investigate\nlive-action heroes further.
This is to better understand\nyou and other humans.
That is a concierge's duty.\nI will persevere.
I ask for your continued\ncooperation.
Phoenix Ranger Featherman\napparently has many\ninstallments.
Which Featherman do you like?
I heard that live-action hero\nshows are made for children.
Most seem to grow out of it\nas they age.
However, some devout fans\ncontinue to watch even\ninto adulthood.
I wish for you to become\nan adult filled with such\na bountiful desire.
Watching a cast of young,\ninexperienced actors
hone their craft over time is\na satisfying sight.
The same concept applies to\nsupporting one's idol.
Please give live action a try\nwhen you have the chance.
Thank you again for your\nassistance with Naruru.
Without you, we would have\nlost her smile.
As always, you exceed\nmy expectations.
That villainous producer had\na complete change of heart.
Or perhaps what we see now\nis his true character.
Humans cannot live\nwithout desire.
Left unchecked, however,\nit invites ruin upon oneself\nand others.
Needless to say, I hope you\nwill exercise due caution.
To possess desire without\nyielding to it... That is my\nsincere wish for you.
Do you recall two employees\nwho informed us of\nNaruru's plight?
We've become acquainted as I\ncontinue to visit Naruru.
I am ever loyal to Naruru, but\nI also enjoy their company.
Although I am reluctant to use\nthe term "fan" to describe\nmy relationship with them.
Friends? With me?\nNo, I couldn't impose.
Though I do not loathe\nthe notion.
An intriguing proposal... But\nwould it not require the unit\nto consist of multiple idols?
I suppose it would work\nif the three were to\nform a group...
I sense a newfound desire\nrising within me.
Could this be a prelude\nto something greater?
I suggest we find the\nanswer together.
I've given it great thought.
What do you think\nof "Meow 3 Stars"\nfor a unit name?
I was pondering on the notion\nof Naruru and her coworkers\nbecoming an idol group.
As a legitimate idol,\nNaruru would be\nin the center.
With Mariyan and Shiyurin\non either side...
Those are their nicknames.\nPlease memorize them.
I think this unit could work.
Or rather, it is guaranteed\nto succeed.
My sincerest apologies for\nmy loss of composure.
I am aware that I am a\nconcierge, not a producer.
As such, I wish to clarify\nthat I would never abandon\nmy duties.
Please ignore my prior\ncareless remarks.
In my idol research, I have\ndiscovered an incredibly\nenchanting individual.
After years out of the\npublic eye, she has returned\nto the spotlight.
Now her idol career shines\nbrighter than ever.
How did she transform\nduring her time away?
If possible, I should\ninvestigate her life\npre-hiatus.
I ask that you refrain from\nmisleading comments.
I am merely interested in her\ntransformation as an idol.
Nevertheless, please keep this\na secret from Naruru.
The fan appreciation event\nwas truly splendid.
It felt as if both\nidols and fans shared\none heart and mind.
Of course, that may simply be\nmy own misconception.
However, if idols are meant\nto show us dreams, then I do\nbelieve I was dreaming.
Just as people once found\ngods within nature,
We fans have found our dreams\nin idols like Naruru.
I wish nothing but happiness\nfor both you and Naruru.
It's been quite some time\nsince I became your concierge.
You've grown far more\nthan I ever imagined.
It is pointless for\na concierge to sing\nher own praises.
But if I was helpful\nto you in the slightest,\nthen I am satisfied.
My apologies. My emotions\ngot the better of me.
This too is proof of your\ntremendous growth.
You are too kind.\nI am grateful enough\nas your concierge.
It is I who should be\nthanking you.
I have?
Perhaps, but that is also\nentirely thanks to you.
And for that, I must say,
I look forward to our\ncontinued partnership.
That alone is the\nunshakeable truth.
Excuse me. I wish for us to go\nsomewhere together to better\nunderstand your true self.
I must clarify that this excursion\nis not bound by the terms of\nour contract. What do you say?
Then I shall await you\nin front of the Velvet Room.
No matter. Another time, then.
Excuse me. I wish to propose\nwe do something that differs\nto our usual meetings.
I shall brief you on the\ndetails of this proposal\nwhen we meet in person.
Understood. Do let me know if\nyou are interested, should you\nnot have other arrangements.
Huh huh... I saw you on the\nway home today, {NAME1}-san.
I didn't want to make the\nnormies suspicious, so I fled\nbefore they could notice.
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have\nrevealed myself?
Very well. I shall do so\non the next occasion.
Rumor has it there's an\nabandoned building near\nour school that's cursed.
Intriguing, right? My senses\nare tingling... It's like I'm\nbeing drawn in...
Oh come on! You're supposed\nto agree to join me!
I guess there is still much to be done...
...before such a feat can be achieved.
Since we're the chosen ones...
We need cover stories to\nprotect our real identities.
Do you know mine,\n{NAME1}-san?
Wait, is that really how\npeople see me?
Hm... If you say so...\nBut still...
{NAME1}-san
Do you know how to enter\nother worlds?
I should have expected you\nto know, {NAME1}-san.
If you place four dolls with\ndifferent expressions in the\ncorners of a room at midnight...
It opens a gate to another\nworld. Or so they say...
Have you tried it too,\n{NAME1}-san?
So there's another way!?\nYou've got to tell me\nabout it!
I need to know...\nWhat fascinating news!\nI must do more research!
I think...
We need aliases.
It's not wise to reveal your\ntrue name in enemy territory.
Yours could be... How about\nthe Hero of Light?
Exactly! A chosen one must\nconceal their true identity.
What about the Hero of Light?\nHaha, I like it.\nIt's perfect...
I've already got my alias,\nby the way.
Heh... Can't you see? With the\nforces of yin and yang working\nin unison, we are unstoppable!
So make sure to call me\nPrince of Darkness\nfrom now on, Hero of Light!
But if we're not on a mission,\nyou can just use my real name.
Have you heard about\nthe cursed video?
I just found out\nabout it today...
I dug it up from the darkest\ndepths of the web. I'm sure\nit's the real thing.
Shall we watch it later?\nWe need to see what\nit's all about!
Oh, I see... Let's do it\nanother time, then.
N-No, I'm not!\nI'm not scared,\nit's just...
I-It really is the real thing,\nI swear! Or I wouldn't ask\nyou to watch it with me.
Anyway... We always have\nto stick together for stuff\nlike this! Safety first!
{NAME1}-san,\nhave you heard of\nthe man-faced dog?
It was a popular ghost story\nway back in the day.
I know it's a bit strange\nfor an old legend like that\nto be popular now...
But I found this one that's\nbeen floating around\nthe web recently...
It's a modern-day ghost story,\nbut about a dog-faced man,\nnot a man-faced dog!
It's true! There's a photo\nof a guy with a dog's head\ndriving a car!
I suppose I can't deny\nthe possibility.
And I forgot to save\nthe photo.
This requires further\ninvestigation. I'll let you\nknow if I find anything.
{NAME1}-san!\nI have a status report!
It's about the dog-faced man\ncase I mentioned before.
The person with the\nhead of a dog!
I saw a photo of it\nonline, remember?
Well I managed to find\nthat same image again.
But it looks like it was\njust an illusion created\nby the camera angle...
The picture just overlapped\nthe driver and his dog.
The information age sure\nmade it hard to separate\nfact from fiction.
My eyes clearly lack the\nability to see through such\nillusions. I must train more.
{NAME1}-san,\nI think I...
I may have done something...
I was exploring a mysterious\nbookstore when I came across\nan old book covered in dust.
Without thinking,\nI accidentally read a\nline from it out loud...
And the book was a grimoire of\ndemon-summoning rituals!
Which basically means...\nI read an incantation to\nconjure some devilish fiend!
The demon could manifest here\nat any moment...
{NAME1}-san,\nwhat should I do!?
You're right... I can't\nget scared before it\neven appears!
You're more confident\nthan I expected,\n{NAME1}-san.
Heh, of course we can't lose\nto some demon...
After all, we're the\nchosen ones!
It's been a while since I read\nthat demon-summoning spell.
But nothing's come after me.\nI haven't even sensed\nanything unholy.
No, actually I continued\nreading the book after that.
And it looks like reciting\nan incantation isn't enough\nto summon an evil entity.
There's actually a whole ritual\nbehind it.
In fact, I just finished doing\nit. I hope a demon appears.\nActually, maybe not...
Both, I think...\nI'm half afraid,\nhalf excited... Heh.
Yes... Now that I've spoken\nto you, I'm prepared.
Just watch me. I'm doing this!
I'm about to send my thoughts\ndirectly into your mind...
Can you tell what I'm\nlooking at right now?
Too bad... It was an apple.
Even for chosen ones,\ntelepathy is difficult.
You mustn't lose faith,\n{NAME1}-san.
Our telepathic powers are sure\nto awaken in time!
No. In fact...
I was waiting for you\nto say that!
I'm researching how to develop\ntelepathic abilities.
Look forward to my findings!\nHehehe.
Did this message surprise you?
I feel like I am able to fully\nunderstand your feelings.
So, you were able to\nsense my emotions?
Hehe... Very good.\nI can feel my telepathic\nskills awakening.
A long time ago, I was able\nto get my hands on psychic\ntraining tools.
It was only a matter of time\nuntil I harnessed my powers.
My, my... I really can't\ncompete with you.
You really read my mind\njust now!
Your powers must be\ngreater than mine.
Where you get your hair cut?
You live in Zoshigaya, right?
You have good sense of style,\nand you blend in so well\nwith normies.
So I was thinking of using\nyour style as a point of\nreference for my new look.
Even as a chosen one, I don't\nwant to be overly conspicuous.
I've been taking secret notes\nfor some time now, haha.
If you could give me tips,\nI'd appreciate it...
I'd better make an appointment\nnow. See you tomorrow!
This world is full\nof curiosities...
I have to wonder why more\npeople don't take notice...
There are miraculous things\nto be found everywhere\nyou look.
But people close their eyes\nto it all so easily!
It's the same reason everyone\ntalks about Menaces.
So I think the purpose of\nchosen ones like us...
Must be to make them\nremember what it's like\nto feel real wonder.
Yes, exactly. You get\nwhat I'm saying?
Our purpose is to open\nthe eyes of the masses!
Ah! Thank you,\n{NAME1}-san!
I knew you had good sense,\nHero of Light.
We chosen ones must strive\nto fulfill our purpose\nhowever we can!
Listen to this,\n{NAME1}-san!
Earlier, I attempted a ritual\nto summon a spirit of\ngood fortune...
I'm not sure... Spirits aren't\nusually visible to the\nhuman eye, after all.
Oh... The demon didn't appear,\nand I thought a lucky spirit\nwould be more useful anyway.
But it doesn't seem like it\nworked properly, either way.
If anything, it was a spirit\nof guidance, not luck.
I had to help out injured\nold folks, lost children...
Yesterday alone, I ran into\nfive different people I had\nto save... I'm exhausted.
Oh, stop it. Although\nI suppose a little praise\nis nice... Heh.
Anyway, I just thought I'd let\nyou know the spell was fake.
There is another ritual I want\nto try next time, though.
I'll be sure to let you know\nhow it goes.
{NAME1}-san,\nI must apologize...
A major impediment to our\ngreat quest has appeared...
Our class president is\ntransferring at the end\nof the month...
And for some reason I was\npicked as the replacement.
I was going to refuse\nthe position at first
But some really\nover-the-top types\nin class got behind it...
So I ended up as the interim\nclass president.
What do you mean,\n"surprisingly"!?
I mean, that's true, I am\na chosen one, but still!
I'm worried it will get in the\nway of my true purpose.
But the trust of the people\ncan be useful. I intend to put\nin the appropriate effort.
Are you good at languages,\n{NAME1}-san?
We chosen ones are embroiled\nin a never-ending battle to\nstay informed, so to speak.
We must search for intel in\nprint and online ensure our\nknowledge is kept up-to-date.
English is handy for reading\nbooks from all over the world.
It's quite useful for online\ndata collection, too.
Haha, not to brag, but you're\nspeaking to the freshman who\ngot the top grades in English!
Sorry... I'm good at reading,\nbut speaking is a bit rough.
I think I'm going to try\ntranslating a grimoire soon.
I'll show it to you\nwhen I'm finished.
Are you good at math,\n{NAME1}-san?
Then, this is a bit\nembarrassing, but...
I have to take a supplementary\ntest for math soon.
Of course I know the\nbasics of numerology,\nbut equations...
So I was wondering if\nyou might be able to\ninstruct me
Really!? Thank you so much!
I am prepared! I'm not a\nchosen one for nothing!
That's a relief, though.
I've never had to ask\nsomeone for something\nlike this before.
I've got to pass this time\nand restore my honor!
The time has come, {NAME1}.\nA new threat has emerged,\nand I'm going to gather intel.
I need to check out a student\nhot spot. Can you come?
Excellent, fellow chosen one.\nLet's go investigate.
Oh, I see. Ping me next time\nyou're available.
{NAME1}-san, regarding\nour usual investigations...
I was thinking of doing\nsomething a little different\nthis time... Care to join me?
Very well. I shall be at my\nusual place, so just let me\nknow if you're interested.
Hey {NAME1}-kun,\nwhat do you look for\nin a part-time job?
I'm actually looking for one\nright now.
It's hard for me to figure out\nwhat to prioritize here.
Hm... Yeah, that makes sense.\nI think it's the same for me.
Thanks, I'll see\nwhat's around.
You sit behind Motoha, right,\n{NAME1}-kun?
Do you guys talk a lot?
Honestly, I'm a little\njealous. I wish I was in the\nsame class as you guys.
We should all eat lunch\ntogether sometime!
Hey, {NAME1}-kun,\nyou live by yourself, right?
Do you make your own dinner?\nThat must be tough.
Huh, so that's what living\nalone is like?
If there's anything I can do\nto help, just say the word!
Do you watch movies\non streaming services,\n{NAME1}-kun?
I'd spend hours watching\nvideos online until recently.
You see, I haven't really\nfelt like it since I broke\nmy shoulder...
But then Motoha was raving\nabout this one streaming site,\nso I signed up.
It made me curious to know\nwhat movies my other friends\nare watching.
What kind of movies do you\nlike, {NAME1}-kun?
Huh, okay! I'll check out\none or two when I have\nthe time.
Thank you for the\nrecommendation!
I'll share my thoughts once\nI've given them a watch.
What do you do in your spare\ntime, {NAME1}-kun?
Until recently, I've always\nspent my free time hanging\nwith friends.
Like Motoha and\nmy teammates...
But everyone's so busy now,\nI hardly get a chance to\ninvite them out.
What would you do if you were\nin my position?
Whatever I feel like...
Do you mind if I message\nyou to talk like this\nfrom time to time?
Great. I feel a lot better.
Thanks for listening to me.\nI'll catch you later.
Mind if I pick your brain?
So! I've saved up quite a bit\nfrom my part-time jobs.
And I thought I'd buy my\nmom and dad something\nwith the money.
Their anniversary's coming up\ntoo, so it's good timing.
But I actually don't know what\nsort of things they like.
I know they'll just tell me\nanything's good if I ask...
I see... That makes sense.
Thanks, I'll give it a little\nmore thought, then.
Say, {NAME1}-kun,\nwhat's your take on\nspicy food?
So, I'm still working at\nthat diner in Shibuya.
They held a contest for their\nhot n' spicy original menu.
The line cooks went all out,\nand made some crazy dishes.
But the manager threw in\nthe towel after one bite...
None of us can stomach it,\nnot even the guys who\ncooked it!
So now they're in the market\nfor some taste testers...
What do you say,\n{NAME1}-kun?\nThink you can take the heat?
I'm with you on that one!\nThat's the right call,\nno matter how you slice it.
Um... You know what, forget\nI said anything! I'm asking\ntoo much of you.
You need guts of steel for\nsomething like this. I mean,\nmy manager literally fainted.
Sorry for bringing up such a\nspicy, uh, dicey proposition!
Would you say you've got good\neyesight, {NAME1}-kun?
Really? Wow, luckyyy!
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I had to get my glasses after\nI hit the books too hard.
My eyesight was still pretty\ngood back when I was\nplaying baseball...
But now that I've quit...\nit's only getting worse.
Really? You couldn't?
Maybe all these jobs\nare keeping my eyes\nin peak condition...
Good idea... Maybe it's\nnot too late to get my\nvisual acuity back.
I haven't been to the batting\ncages in forever, either.
At any rate, I'll do my best\nto make sure it doesn't\nget any worse!
I got a frantic message from\nMotoha. She was like...
"I'm totally gonna fail this\ntest! Help me cram!"
But I don't know the first\nthing about tutoring...
Do you?
So you do? Now that's\nquite something.
Yeah, fair enough. It's easier\nsaid than done, right?
I have a real hard time\ncompartmentalizing things.
Divvying ideas up into\nteachable chunks\nis hard.
Still, there must be\nsome way, right?
Come to think of it, teaching\ntechniques was pretty easy!
Huh... So like, show Motoha\nhow I study for exams?
Oh, I think you might be onto\nsomething there. Thanks!
Motoha didn't fail!
Thanks, but maybe save the\ncongrats for Motoha.
Thanks! But Motoha's the one\nwho put in all the work.
I taught her a bunch of stuff\nwhen we used to play baseball.
So, I tried to remember how I\nwent about things back then.
Once she absorbs a technique,\nMotoha never forgets it.
Sooo, I just had to think\nabout how she took\nthe information in.
Once I figured it out,\nour study session was\na breeze!
Hee hee! You're the second one\nto call me that, after Motoha.
Oh, good idea! All three of us\nfor the next study session.
I'll reach out when the next\ntest period's coming up!
Hey, I could use your help.
Got any friends who'd be\ninterested in women's\nbaseball gear?
Um... Well, I can't play\nanymore, right?
I made sure to keep everything\nthat was important to me.
But... I have no clue what\nto do with my spare mitt\nand stuff I don't need.
It's new, but it's a little on\nthe small side. Besides...
Not a lot of girls trying out\nfor catcher these days.
I'd hate to throw it out, but\nif I can't find any takers...
Oh, that'd work!\nI bet I'll find someone\nwho wants it!
Good idea! That way it's sure\nto end up in the hands of\nsomeone who needs it.
Glad I came to you.\nI'll let you know\nhow it goes!
I found someone to take my\nspare baseball equipment!
An elementary schooler.\nTurns out it was the\nperfect fit, too!
She wants to be a pro player\nwhen she grows up!
So I made sure to focus all\nmy positive energy into it\nbefore handing it off.
You know... I thought I was\nover it when I had to quit\nplaying baseball.
I figured it would be best to\njust put it all behind me.
But now, I think my love for\nit is a good thing... Maybe?
I do love baseball.\nI really do!
You're probably not interested\nin stuff like this, but...
I just heard something pretty\nincredible... Can I tell you?
I still go to the hospital for\nregular checkups, right?
Well, apparently a pro\nbaseball player from\nway back is there!
Sounds like he was admitted.\nHe is pretty old, after all.
I imagine most people wouldn't\nrecognize him by name alone.
But diehard fans like me and\nmy folks know it anywhere.
Not gonna lie,\nI kinda want to!
Still, it's a hospital.\nI can't just barge in\non him.
Hope he gets better soon!
I went to go cheer on my old\nbaseball team the other day!
The coach and everyone\non the team invited me\nto come watch.
It was a real nail-biter.\nThey eked out a draw\nsomehow...
I thought that me dropping out\nsuddenly caused huge problems.
But they all just said they're\ndoing fine and... like...
Sorry... I'm just venting\nmore than anything.
Yeah. I feel better now.\nThanks for listening.
Oh, right. The music club came\nto support the game, too!
So, I asked them about making\na song to cheer on Kotone-san.
I'll let you know if we make\nany progress!
Do you remember that baseball\npro staying at my hospital?
I ran into him last time\nI went in. Right in\nthe courtyard!
At first I thought he was just\nsome guy in a wheelchair...
But when the nurse wheeled\nhim by, I recognized his face\nright away!
I let it slip that I was\na big fan, and, well...
He thanked me for remembering\nhim, and burst into tears.
Must be lonely when all the\nfans who knew you are gone...
Yeah, I got to hear tons of\ngreat tales about his heyday.
Right! He was super happy\nto sign one for me.
I'm really glad I got to\nmeet him.
Sorry, just wanted to update\nyou. Thanks for listening.
So, about that song I asked\nthe music club to perform\nfor Kotone-san.
I couldn't exactly get\neveryone on board...
But a bunch of them actually\nagreed to do it!
Yeah, brass band tends to be\npretty loud, so it'll be fine.
Trying to decide on which song\nto perform was tough.
None of our ideas stood out.\nNot really, anyway.
What do you think would work\nfor cheering on Kotone-san?
Oh, I'll use the one we played\nwhen I would step up to bat.
Thanks a lot. I'll let the\nmusic club know!
You'll never guess what\nI heard about Kotone-san's\nnext big competition.
Apparently she's going to\nskate to the song I chose\nfor her!
I heard Kotone-san called the\nmusic club over yesterday.
She asked them to do a studio\nrecording of the song.
They messaged me earlier\ntelling me how nerve-racking\nit was.
Although they did make sure to\nsqueeze in a humblebrag about\ngetting autographs after.
Still, can you even\nbelieve it?
Kotone-san, performing to\nthe song I chose...
Yeah! That, and I'm just\nso happy.
A little bit, yeah... But more\nhappy than anything else.
I can hardly wait for\nthe competition!
Did you see the news today?
There was an article\nabout Kotone-san.
Her comeback at the next\ncompetition is all anybody's\ntalking about.
She's still getting the same\nnasty comments as before...
But, a lot of people\nseem pretty excited\nto see her return!
Yeah! We'd better do all we\ncan to cheer her on.
I haven't heard anything\nfrom her yet.
It sounds like she's awfully\nbusy with practice, anyway.
Oh yeah, she did say\nshe'll get some tickets\nto the competition!
That means one for you too,\nof course. We should go\nsee it! Together, I mean.
Better make sure I don't\nhave any work that day.
Hi! I know this is a bit\nout of the blue, but\nare you free today?
There's someplace I'd like\nto go with you. If you\nhave the time, of course.
Great, thanks so much!\nSo, where's a good spot\nfor us to meet?
Ah, I see. Sorry to hear it...\nThere's always\nnext time!
I was thinking of studying\nfor that quiz tomorrow...
But I have a bit of a problem.\nAre you free, by any chance,\n{NAME2}?
Great! I'll wait for you\nat my usual spot.
That's okay, it doesn't have\nto be right now. I'll be at my\nusual spot if you're free.
I've been worried about my\nskin lately. I'm usually\ncareful with it, but still!
Do you have any kind\nof skincare routine,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Oh, the luster of youth!\nI'm jealous that your skin\ncan look so good.
Oh! That's kids these days\nfor you.
I'll do my best to get my skin\nlooking as beautiful as yours,\n{NAME2}-chan!
So, I saw this ad on TV.
It got me going to a burger\nshop for the first time\nin what must be forever.
Burgers are so expensive\nthese days, huh! They used\nto be a lot cheaper.
Well, I guess someone your age\nwouldn't know any different.\nAnother sign of the times...
Do people still have pen pals?
Do you even know what\nI'm talking about?
I guess it's all about social\nmedia these days. Nobody sends\nfriends emails anymore, right?
How would you\nabbreviate that I wonder...\n"Socmed pals," maybe?
But we're neighbors first and\nforemost, so here's to years\nof good memories to come!
Know what a phone charm is?
People would attach a bunch\nof them to their flip phones.
I found a ton of unopened ones\nwhen I was cleaning out\nmy closet.
I used to be a serious collector.
But you don't really see them\ndangling from people's phones\nthese days, do you?
{NAME2}-chan, if you had one,\nwhat would you do with it?
Oh, really!? Phew, maybe I'll\ndo the same, then.
Good idea. They're retro,\nbut still cute. I'll find\nsomewhere else to put them.
I'm glad I came to you\nfor advice. Thank you!
Oh, and did you eat today?\nMake sure you're eating\nwell-balanced meals, okay?
Wow, so photo booths are still\na thing!? Do you know about\nthese, {NAME2}-chan?
I passed by an arcade and saw\none when I peeked inside.
They're so much bigger than\nthe ones I remember using.
I couldn't help but feel\na little nostalgic.
I thought about it, but\nI was on my own.
Maybe I'll take my hubby\non a date, and we can go\nto one together next time.
Thank yooouuu! I'd feel much\nmore comfortable using one\nwith someone younger with me.
Oh, but I do want to go\nwith my hubby first...
Oooh, I'm so excited!
I wonder if they still\nhave codes that unlock\nsecret frames...
Oh, I guess they're a little\nold-school.
You should go ask your mom\nif you don't know what I'm\ntalking about.
I got a new smartphone!
Learning how to use it took\nsome time, but these modern\nphones are amazing, huh?
The cameras are way better\nthan the digital cameras\nwe had back in the day.
They really have an app\nfor everything now, too.\nI can't believe it!
I have no idea what\napps are worth having.\nThere's too many...
Are there any you\nwould recommend,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Oh, great idea. Apparently\nyou can even read magazines\non your phone now!
The words are so small\nand hard to read though...\nIs it time I got glasses?
Ahh, you can't go wrong with\ngames. They're perfect for\nkilling time!
There's so many of them,\nthough... I wonder if there\nare any good ones.
Whatever, I'll just try some\nand find out! Thank you!
{NAME2}-chan!\nYou won't believe it!
There's a huge sale at the\nsupermarket right now!
It's not the closest one,\nbut they're selling cartons\nof eggs for 99 yen!
Find some time to go,\nit'd be such a waste to let\nthis chance pass you by!
Whaaat!? No, but this is about\ngetting a good deal!
Being a housewife is all about\nbuying the best thing possible\nat the cheapest price.
Ah, but I guess you\naren't a housewife...
But it's not like you have all\nthe money in the world, right?
I see. Yeah, now that you\nmention it, you might\nbe right.
So that's how kids these days\nthink about things...
Huh, okay! I learned\nsomething today. Thanks,\n{NAME2}-chan!
Seems like you and Leo-chan\nare getting along well, hm?
Your name comes up all the\ntime lately when we talk.
Oh, sure. Yeah, I guess that\nmakes sense.
I hope you two keep on\ngetting along!
The thing about being a mom is\nthat you start worrying over\nkids who aren't yours, too.
It's easy to go overboard\nwithout realizing.
Making sure you give\na youngster the space\nthey need is hard...
Of course, it's always easy to\ntalk to you because you're so\nmature, {NAME2}-chan.
Anyway, I hope you continue\nto keep in touch with both me\nand Leo-chan, okay?
Modern photo booths amaze me!
They even adjust the size\nof your eyes and the length\nof your legs now!
They're nothing like\nthe booths we had when\nI was growing up.
They came out perfect!\nI took them with my hubby!
I look so young it's like I'm\nback in high school again!
Oooh, so that's what\nthey're called! Filters!
Yeah, I went wild with them!\nIt's like I was a high school\ngirl again!
I dunno about my skin, though.\nIt made mine almost a bit\ntoo pale, know what I mean?
I used to put fake tan on all\nthe time back in high school.
I'd look just like the old me\nif they'd let me adjust the\nmakeup and skin a little...
Wouldn't it be great if there\nwas a photo booth that let\nyou look all nice and tan?
What do kids these days even\ndo with the pictures they\ntake at photo booths anyway?
Taking pics with my hubby\nwas fun, but I don't have\nanywhere to display them.
What would you stick\nyour photos to,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Oh, of course! Your phone\ncase! Yeah, that does seem\nlike the trend these days.
So I guess things haven't\nchanged. Okay, onto my\nbudget planner they go!
This reminds me a lot\nof what we used to do\nwhen I was at school!
We'd stick them all over these\nspecial photo albums we bought\nor trade them with each other.
Some of us would even hide\nphotos of our crush inside\nour phone's battery case.
Ohmigosh, this takes me back!\nIt's like I've actually turned\nback the clock or something.
Now I want to take even\nmore photos, y'know?
Let's take some pics\ntogether sometime, okay,\n{NAME2}-chan?
Are your parents still on that\ntrip, {NAME2}-chan?
Oh? So I was right.
It's great that they get along\nso well, but it must be\ntough on you, {NAME2}-chan.
My hubby left on a work trip\ntoday too. I'm all alone.
It's not for long, but our\nplace just feels so big when\nit's just me, you know?
Don't you ever get lonely\nliving by yourself?
Yeah, I guess you are a\nstudent. Not having your folks\naround must have its perks.
Maybe I'll try reaching out\nto some friends from my\nstudent days for a change.
Might as well make the most\nof having the whole house\nto yourself, right?
It's amazing that you're\nable to live alone at\nsuch a young age.
It can't be easy, right?
My hubby's still out\non his work trip, so...
I start slacking with\nthe housework when\nI'm by myself.
I barely put any effort into\nmaking dinner, and my cleaning\ngets pretty sloppy too.
What about you? Do you clean?\nAre you making sure to eat?
Well, someone has it\nfigured out! I could learn\nfrom your example.
Oh, sorry! I'm the one who's\nfalling short here, I know.
Staying on top of everything\nwhen it's just you is tougher\nthan I imagined.
Let's both give solo life\neverything we've got, ok?
I know it's a little late,\nbut thank you for helping\nout Leo-chan.
I know a lot happened with\nhim, but things seem to have\nworked out.
It might have grown into\na whole other issue\nif you weren't around.
You're sooo mature! Are you\nsure you're still just in high\nschool, {NAME2}-chan?
It feels like you're clearly\nolder than me in spirit.
I'd always thought you\nwere just a regular kid\nin the neighborhood...
What kind of experiences\ndo you need to go through to\nend up as mature as you?
Oh, you! Always telling jokes,\n{NAME2}-chan!
Well, I can say for sure that\nyou'd never do anything bad.
I understand wanting to\nact like a bad boy, though.\nIn fact, it's a relief!
I'm just glad to see\nyou do act your age\nevery now and then.
You're like the opposite of\nme, in that maybe you could\nbe a little more childish.
I assume you heard from\nLeo-chan already, but he's\ngoing to be leaving.
I've been helping him\npack his things.
Having to see a kid off is\nso sad! It was the same\nwith my own son.
It reminds me of when I\nwas younger and finally\nleaving home.
I wonder if my parents felt\nthe same way I do now.
That's exactly it! Children\nnever really get how much their\nparents love them.
Of course, parents are never\nable to fully understand how\ntheir children feel either...
Maybe it's the same endless\ncycle regardless of age.
If that's the case, I should\njust suck it up and accept it.
That's what it means to\nbe the one having to watch\na young one leave the nest.
Oh, I'm being a bit of a\nwet blanket now, aren't I?\nSorry, forget I said anything!
Going back over and reading\nthat is making me feel\nkind of embarrassed...
Is there any way to delete it?\nOh, I hate how all this stuff\nstays on your phone!
Do you have any hobbies,\n{NAME2}-chan?
That's right, you bought\na desk, didn't you? You must\nlike handiwork? Cool!
Ooh, I'd really like to try\nyour cooking some time.
I have a lot of free time\nthese days when my hubby\nis off at work.
And Leo-chan's going to be\noff doing his own thing\nsoon too...
So I was thinking about taking\nup some kind of hobby myself.
But I just can't find one\nthat feels right for me.
Well... Yeah, there's some\nstuff that I don't do anymore.
I don't know if I'd call them\nhobbies, though. More like\ndreams or ambitions.
Something I've never tried\nbefore, hm? I wonder what\nthat could be.
Though there are some things\nI've felt like wanting to do\none day!
You know, I think I'm\nstarting to get some idea\nof what I could try!
Thanks, {NAME2}-chan!\nI'll message you again later.
Hey, so have you been wearing\nthe clothes I gave you?
That's greeeat! I'm so happy.\nThose are actually pretty\nnice pieces, you know.
Believe it or not, I used to\nwork in fashion.
I've been a housewife for\na while now after meeting\nmy hubby, of course.
But maybe this means that\nI still have a sharp eye\nwhen it comes to looks?
Ooh, maybe I should become\nyour full-time stylist next!
Really? I was expecting you\nto say no! Aww, I'm so happy!\nJust leave it to me!
Hahaha! Hey, I was\njust kidding, you know!\nYou're such a cutie!
I'll find some new clothes\nfor you, then. Something to\nlook forward to!
I can't stop scrolling\nthrough online videos\nwhen I'm bored...
It's like time just melts away\nthe minute I'm watching vids\nof other peoples' pets!
Would you consider yourself\na dog person or a cat person,\n{NAME2}-chan?
I know, right? They're so\nfloofy and cute!
I love petting animals,\nbut caring for one is so\nmuch work, you know?
You don't have any pets\nat home, do you?
Ooh, how mysterious!\nI'm actually pretty jealous.
You're kidding though...\nright? You know you shouldn't\ntease your elders!
We're talking about pets here!\nI suppose you do still have to\nraise them, but still...
Of course, you'd never be able\nto care for an animal if you\ncan't even care for plants.
Aww, I want a pet so badly!
Might grow some plants...
But I'm not sure what I\nshould get. Do you have\nany suggestions?
That sounds wonderful!\nAll that color, right outside\nmy window!
Ooh, I like it!\nI bet it'd even help\nspruce up dinner!
Raising a child was so much\nwork. I was relieved when\nit was over, but...
Well, seems like my desire to\nlook after something hasn't\ncompletely gone away.
That's probably why I tend to\nbe a bit too watchful when it\ncomes to you.
Thanks for always putting up\nwith me. I hope I'm not\nannoying you.
I'm so glad to hear you\nsay that! Well, then here's\nto even more meddling!
Oops, so I guess you were\nthe one looking after me?
Well, either way. Thanks for\nall the advice! I'll message\nyou again later, okay?

Sorry for the sudden text.\nDo you have a second?
Kayo-san's been asking you for\nadvice on all kinds of stuff,\nright?
I was wondering if I could ask\nyou for some advice myself.
Sorry. I know this is totally\ncoming out of nowhere...
This might take a while. Could\nwe meet outside in a bit?
Oh, {NAME2}-chan!\nAre you free?
Would you like to hang out?\nI'd love to learn what teens\nare into these days.
Great! I know this is sudden,\nbut are you able to come over\nnow?
That's fine, no pressure.\nIf you happen to have time,\nyou know where I am.
Really? That's too bad. Maybe when\nyou have some time, okay?
Hey, {NAME2}-chan,\nthere's something that's\nbeen on my mind lately...
I was wondering if we could\nmeet up and I could talk\nto you about it.
That's okay, just when you\nhave time. I'm sure you're\nbusy with other things, too.
Hey! You free right now?
Leek, dried sardines,\nbonito, kelp, garlic,\nginger, celery.
Oh. My bad.
Wrong person.
Meant to send it to my mom.
How do you deal\nwith heartburn?
The ramen I just had went\nheavy on the fat.
Ah, good idea. Hope they\nhave somethin'.
Thanks. I'll return the\nfavor sometime.
Mind if I ask you something?
You like your ramen\nlight or heavy?
Cool. Good to know.
I like to keep up-to-date with\nwhat customers like. Ttyl.
You know the origin\nof the word "soy"?
Yeah, that.
Nah, I mean regular soybeans.
I was looking it up earlier.
Apparently, it comes from\nthe Japanese word "shoyu".
They brought it to Europe as\n"soya" in the 17th century.
That became soy in English.\nIt's why we call 'em soybeans.
Basically, soy is a\nJapanese loanword.
Kinda weird, right?
Just felt like sharing that.\nAnyway, catch ya soon.
Noodles count as a\nstaple food, yeah?
Right? Glad you agree.
Ask anyone else and they'd\nonly bring up rice and bread.
I say it's fine to have\nnoodles for all three meals.
Why don't more people do that?
Huh, yeah. I can\nunderstand that.
Depends on where you live,\nhuh. Like, pasta in Italy.
It makes sense now. Thanks.
I told my mom about you\nat dinner today.
She was shocked.
Said it's been forever since I\ntalked about a classmate.
When I was workin',\nI'd bring up customers\nand coworkers.
Normally, I just sit and\nlet her talk my ear off.
Right... I guess that\nmakes sense.
Feels like it's been forever\nsince I brought up a friend.
Lately, my mom's been\nasking about you.
You know, what we've eaten\nand where we've gone.
Nothin' out of the ordinary.
Do moms really want to know\nabout this stuff?
The other day, she even asked\nme to bring you along.
My mom's on the night shift,\nso she might not be around.
My place is nothing special,\nbut if you really want to...
Come by whenever.
What dish would you choose to\nend a yakiniku course on?
Good call. Can't go wrong\nwith that.
Kinda strange, really.\nI'd eat all that meat...
And still have room\nfor noodles.
Yeah, I guess some stores\nfinish off with rice soup.
Sure, can't go wrong with\nice cream or almond jelly.
They all go down smoothly.
I guess that's what\nmatters most.
Remember what I told you\nabout the word "soy"?
Turns out there are\nloads of them.
Like with the Sahara Desert,\n"Sahara" just means desert.
"Hula" means "dance", and\n"salsa" means "sauce".
The "Erimo" in Cape Erimo\nmeans "cape" in Ainu.
It's surprising how there's\nso much more to common words\nthan we think, right?
It's fun to look this\nstuff up, you know?
Yeah, that's another one!\nThere must be more.
Lemme know if you\nfind more, yeah?
Hey, remember our soy talk?
Yeah, I'm talkin' about food.
Yeah. I've been looking\ninto it more.
A lot of words related to\nfoods and seasonings\ntend to double up.
It happens when foreign foods\nare introduced to a country,\nand locals adapt the flavors.
It's interesting to see things\nfrom that point of view.
I get excited thinking about\nhow it'll make my food better.\nI just can't stop.
It's giving me too many ideas.\nI want to try out everything.
I should be able to cook up\nsomething interesting.
I tried some ramen at this\nrun-down Chinese restaurant.
The noodles and soup\nwere nothing special.
But their roasted pork slices\nreally stood out.
The old man who ran\nthe place told me how\nto make the marinade.
But I just can't\nget it right...
How does he do it?
Yeah, makes no sense. He just\nseemed to dump everything in a\nbowl and serve it up. So...
Hey, can't blame me for being\ncurious. When it comes to\nflavors, I'm always serious...
Wait.
Maybe it's about not\ntrying too hard. Is that\nwhy it's good?
I need to try this out.
I'll throw the sugar in\nhalf at a time.
The second time, I won't let\nit dissolve completely.
That's how you get the\nmarinade to taste so good.
It's the roasted pork recipe\nI mentioned before.
The uneven distribution\nof flavor is what made it\nso delicious.
Talkin' to you made me realize\nthat all this time, all I had\nto do was just wing it.
If I didn't talk it out with\nyou, I'd still be struggling.
The roast pork?\nWhenever you want.
I'll make the best bowl of\nramen to go with this pork.
You know, the first guy to\ntry out fermented food...
Either they were hella brave,\nor incredibly desperate.
I wonder which.
Yeah, I agree.\nThat takes guts of steel.
Lucky for the guy, it turned\nout to be delicious and had\na great shelf life.
People still ferment stuff.\nHell, we're getting better\nat it.
To think someone sealed away\nthe right food for a while and\ninvented a tasty snack... Wow!
That's exactly why fermented\nfoods are cool, if you ask me.
I knew that you'd understand.
I tried making my own homemade\nseasoned bamboo shoots.
If I'm happy with them,\nI'll let you try some.
Damn it...
Those bamboo shoots I made\nthe other day...
Nah.
They're perfect.
Turned out better than I ever\nthought they would.
Issue is, my mom moved them\naround a bunch.
I don't know how she did it.\nWhy'd they turn out so well?
Yeah. I'll nail this taste\ndown, all right.
Right... I guess I'll start by\nuncovering its mystery.
I'll get back to you when\nI figure it out.
Met Pops the other day.\nIt's been forever.
I had him try the best bowl\nof ramen I could make.
He praised me like\nnever before.
And when he was done...
He told me...
"What matters is\nwhat comes next."
The best bowl is just\na means to an end.
I guess, yeah.
I don't know yet what\ntruly matters.
But I know that talking to you\nhelps me sort out how I feel.
If you don't mind,\nI hope you'll keep\nlending me an ear.
Heh, thanks.
I've been thinking about\nstuff. Mind hearing me out?
Imagine two bowls of ramen,\none's perfect, one's not.
Pops says the latter is\njust right.
If I want my customers to be\ntruly satisfied...
They must be the ones\nto decide how to enjoy\ntheir meal.
Yeah, it's not about forcing\nmy best onto the customers.
I've gotta let them decide\non their own what's best.
Or at least, I think so.
I've never owned my own store,\nso I'm not sure.
I feel more confident talking\nit out with you though.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, {NAME2}.\nYou got a moment?
There's something bothering\nme, I guess...
There are so many flavors and\nrecipes I want to try out.
But that might not be what\nthe customer wants.
If that's that case, then...
What's the point of searching\nfor my own flavor?
Shouldn't I just make what\nthe customers want to eat?
That's what I'm wondering.
My goal... Yeah, you're right.
I lost myself for a bit.
I want to create the best\nflavor experience I can\nfor my customers.
Huh? What was I\nso worried about?
You're a lifesaver. I mean it.\nThanks, man.
Spoke to a guy from class...
He laughed and said I was\nsurprisingly friendly.
"Surprisingly"? What did he\nmean by that?
Hey! No one asked for\na walking dictionary.
Huh, you might be right.
I've never been all that great\nat talking to others.
That's why he was\nso surprised, huh.
Yeah... Glad to hear that,\nbut you're making me blush.
If I have, it's thanks to you.
Anyway, see ya!
Hey, you free right now?
I'm off to try somethin' new\nto develop my palate.\nWanna tag along?
Gotcha. Maybe some other time.
Hey, you busy?\nThere's something\nI gotta ask you.
Can I use your kitchen?
Hang on. I'd better explain\nthe situation first.
I can fill you in more at my\nusual spot, so meet me there.
I don't mean like right now.\nI'll be at my usual spot, so\ncome by if you've got time.
Hey, {NAME1}-san,\nare you good at\nwaking up early?
The telltale signs of\nan oversleeper. But hey,\nthat's why we're friends.
I usually feel super groggy\nin the morning.
So I need a cup of tea\nto force my gears to\nstart turning.
Hey Sensei, do you read\nautobiographical manga?
Ahaha, those things're mostly\nfluff, don't ya think?
Still, when it comes to\ntalking about nothing,
Japanese authors have always\nbeen good at making the\nmundane sound so interesting.
I always give new teas a try\nwhen I spot them in the\nconvenience store.
You don't see any sweetened\ngreen teas in Japan, now that\nI think about it.
Would you ever\ngive it a try, Sensei?
Mint tea is lovely in the\nwarmer months, you know.
Wasn't sure what they meant\nby authentic Chinese food\nthe first time I heard it.
But it basically means\nthe real deal! Not the dishes\ntweaked for Japanese palates.
It's been getting real popular\nthese days. Want to go try\nsome together next time?
That's the spirit, Sensei!\nIt'll be a great experience,\nfor sure.
The ingredients and seasonings\nare a bit different from\nChinese food here in Japan.
Not everything is spicy,\nyou know! Different regions\nhave their own flavors.
Though I am a Sichuan girl.\nThat tongue-numbing heat\nis right up my alley.
I'll see if I can find any\ngood restaurants nearby.
Consider it my way of saying\nthanks for all the things\nyou teach me!
I realized something super\nimportant when I spoke with\nsome school friends today.
I need to try raw egg\nover rice!
There are all sorts of egg\ndishes where I come from.
But I would have never even\nconsidered eating it the way\nthey serve it here\u2014raw.
What about you, Sensei?\nDo you eat a lot of\nraw egg with rice?
Oh-ho! I thought so.
So... it's that tasty, huh.
The eggs they sell in this\ncountry are safe to eat raw.
When in Japan, do as\nthe Japanese do, right!?
I know Chinese and\nJapanese supermarkets\nsell different stuff.
But man, I couldn't believe\nhow many bath salts\nthey stock in this country!
"Aroma" this,\n"hot spring minerals" that,\nyou name it.
What sorta bath salts\ndo you like, Sensei?
Ooh, I could see how\na bright, fragrant bath\ncould lift your mood.
Me, I'd go for anything that\nkeeps me moisturized.
Speaking of which, Japan is\nchock-full of hot springs.
Ones that make your\nskin smooth, improve\ncirculation, etc.
If it's all true, that'd be\npretty incredible,\ndon't you think?
Heck, I might have to give\nsome of these salts a shot.
I'll buy a whole bunch\nand see for myself!
Walking around the city\nmade me realize something...
Japan sure loves its vending\nmachines, doesn't it?
In places with convenience\nstores around practically\nevery corner...
I don't see much of a point\nto all these machines.
Hmm... Is that it?\nNot sure if I agree.
Japanese people have a\nreputation for being polite,\nand I think so too.
But maybe people just want to\nget things done without the\nfuss of talking with anyone?
Uh, I guess I still don't\ncompletely get it.
Oh, it was just a thought.\nMaybe I'm totally\noff the mark.
Guess I said something\na little weird, huh.\nI'll mull it over a bit more.
Did you know some Japanese\nwords exist in Chinese too,\nbut have different meanings?
It's a little confusing, but I\nfind it real interesting.
Let's see. Well, the word for\n"study" in Japanese can mean\n"reluctance" in Chinese.
It's a pretty interesting\nconnection, don't you think?
It made me wonder whether that\nnuance exists in Japanese too.
If so, then maybe Japanese\npeople have always been\nreluctant to hit the books...
Totally relatable,\nif you ask me.
Who knows, it might've been\na joke the first time someone\nsaid it.
Although you gotta agree\nthat this is an absolute gem\nof a find. Haha.
I use my computer to keep\nin touch with Mama.
I always struggle to come up\nwith an answer when she asks\nme how university's going.
I'm making the most of my time\nhere in Japan, but sometimes\nmy studies take a back seat...
Yeah, I could just say\nI'm studying by living\neveryday life!
Right... yeah. There is\nsomething that I've been\nmulling over.
And that's what kind of person\nI want to become.
It would've been better if I'd\nfigured this all out before\nI came to study, sure.
But as they say, you'll never\nknow unless you try.
I feel better after talking\nto you, Sensei.
Now I can face my Mama\nwith pride, and tell her\nmy studies are going A-OK!
Papa was the one who insisted\nI study abroad...
but I haven't talked to him\nmuch since I got here.
I appreciate the space,\nbut I admit it does\nbother me a bit.
Don't tell me that he's\nsecretly expecting more\nfrom me than Mama!
Aww geez, I'd take the\nconstant nagging any day\nover a ticking time bomb!
In other words, they've put\ntheir faith in me?
Aww geez... Somehow that\nfeels even heavier, y'know?
At any rate, the fact that\nI have to show good results\nhasn't changed a bit.
I'm the one who'll be\nin trouble if I don't,\nafter all.
Better put my nose to the\ngrindstone, as they say...
Welp, wish me luck, Sensei!
In one of my lectures, I heard\nthat the Chinese first arrived\nin Japan centuries ago.
There was even a Chinese\nsettlement in the Hakata ward\nof Kyushu 1000 years ago!
Pretty amazing, huh?
Around the same time,\nJapanese people from the\nGoto Islands in Nagasaki...
would travel to and from China\non the regular.
Not exactly next door\nneighbors, when you\nthink about it.
That's why I can't help but\nfind it so incredible.
I'd love to go check out\nHakata and the Goto Islands\nsometime!
Oh yeah, I heard riding the\ntrain all the way to Hakata\nis brutal on the ole keister.
Then it's a whole other flight\nor boat ride to the islands...
You'd have to catch a flight\nto get from Hakata to\nthe islands, right?
So doing it all in one trip\nwouldn't be much different\nto two trips. Hmm...
I thought about it\non my travels...
They have Chinatowns not only\nin Yokohama, but Kobe and\nNagasaki, too.
I'd love to check them out\nsometime. It'd be a whole lot\neasier than going to Hakata.
I've heard of people from my\nhomeland who made the trek to\nJapan in search of something.
I really wanna know exactly\nwhat it is they came for.
For sure. I'm still trying to\nfigure out what it is I want.
I figured maybe they could\ngive me a few hints.
Not sure. There's so much\nmore I need to learn about\nthis country.
Including what others saw in\nchoosing to settle here.
Adults are always telling us\nto watch our language\nand stuff.
Don't say things that could\nruffle people's feathers,\nthey say.
Japan takes that to a whole\nother level.
If I'm being honest, I'm not\ngood at holding my tongue...
I can't help but bite back\nwhen someone disagrees\nwith me.
You're the same, huh, Sensei?\nGetting all riled up...
What's most important\nis how you act after\nall's said and done.
You're right. I'm sure that's\nwhat I'm lacking.
Just venting your feelings\nwon't help anything.
I kind of get it now.
I'm not the only one out there\nwith a short fuse, huh?
Gotta say, that's a relief\nto hear, Sensei. Thanks!
Backtracking a bit...
I'm well aware that I have\ntrouble speaking kindly\nor subtly.
Especially when I have\nsomething super important\nto say.
My impulse to speak my mind\ntakes the wheel.
Not only do I talk straight,\nbut I don't care what\npeople think of me.
I only worry about whether\nor not they're picking up\nwhat I'm putting down.
I don't have that problem with\nyou though, do I, Sensei?
The way you say something\nis important, of course.
I wish I could say things the\nbest way possible\u2014or at least\nbe nice about it.
But if I hold back, and\nend up failing to convey\nwhat I want to, well...
Yep, I'd definitely regret it.\nFor sure.
That's one worry down for\nole Yaoling. Thanks a bunch!
If speaking my mind\nmakes someone hate me,\nthen I'll be the bad guy.
That's how I used\nto think, anyway.
The only thing that mattered\nto me was...
Where I'll land when\nthe dust settles.
In other words, I wasn't\nseriously considering the\nperson I was talking to.
It took being on the receiving\nend of it to finally realize\nwhat I was doing.
There's no point in playing\nthe blame game.
That's the same thing as\ngiving up and running from\nthe conversation.
Yeah, my bad. But when I think\nabout it seriously\u2014and I mean\nreally seriously...
I'm finally learning how\nlackadaisical I can be.
When you're really trying to\nfix a problem, whose fault\nit is doesn't matter.
It's like you say, Sensei.\nThis has been a good\nlearning experience for me.
Geez, all this stuff has gone\nto show me just how childish\nI can be.
Look at me, forcing my own\nopinions onto others...
It won't get them any closer\nto understanding where\nI'm coming from.
Denying it was my fault. I was\njust trying to make excuses\nto cover up for myself.
Right. You can't grow up if\nall you care about is whether\nor not you think it's fair.
Exactly. Focusing on what's\nright or wrong isn't enough.
This whole thing with\nYukimi-san...
I feel like I made things\npretty awkward...
but I'm happy to say\nI've wiped the whole thing\nfrom my brain box.
Ha ha, I thought you'd\nsay that! And honestly,\nI really needed to hear it.
I got mad and sad.\nDragged you here\nand there, Sensei...
Yeah, I sure got taught\na valuable lesson.
I never thought I'd end up\nthinking this way.
I couldn't forget what\nI've learned here,\neven if I wanted to.
I'm still in the middle\nof my studies...
So I imagine I've got plenty\nof cringey moments ahead\nof me\u2014and failures, to boot.
But instead of beating\nmyself up and backing off...
I'd rather forge on ahead and\nembrace the embarrassment.
That way, I sure won't forget\nwhat I've learned.
It's reassuring to hear you\nsay that, Sensei!
I might make my fair share\nof messes going forward.
I guess it's weird to say I'm\nlooking forward to it, but,\nuh, I actually kind of am!
I'm still in the middle\nof my studies.
I have to write this report\nfor uni...
...and I'd like you to\ncheck it to make sure\nmy Japanese is correct!
I'm at the diner right now,\nso if you're free, I could\nreally use your help!
Hey, Sensei!\nGot some free time today?
Awesome! I'm looking forward\nto learning a lot from you!
Too bad, but no worries. Let's go some\nother time, okay?
Let me know when you've\ngot some time!
Hey, Sensei, umm...\nDo you have time today?
There's something\nI would really appreciate\nyour help with.
Thank you! Sorry this\nis so short notice...
I'll meet you at the usual\nplace in Yongen-Jaya!
That's all right, it doesn't\nneed to be now. Just when\nyou have time, Sensei.
Hello! It's me! Yui!
I was getting lonely\nonly talking to you\nin that world.
So let's chat via IMs\nfrom time to time\nas well!
What's the shortest season\nof the year? Take a guess!
Nope! It's Fall.\nOnly four letters!
Better luck next time!
Thanks for replying though!\nI was so terribly bored!
I'm bored out of my mind.\nTell me a joke!
Is that right?
Then I guess I'll have to\ncome up with something\nnext time!
Good day to you!
Do you have a favorite fruit?
Apples grow in cold climates.\nThe greater the difference in\ntemp between day and night,
the sweeter and redder\nthe fruits!
On the other hand, mandarins\ngrow well in warm climates!
Mandarins prefer\nwarmer climates.
I heard that stable\ntemperatures produce\nsourer fruit.
Apples, however,\ngrow well when cold!
They may both be fruits,\nbut their needs are different!
Isn't the world of\nhorticulture just so\ndeep and fascinating!
I'm getting more excited\nby the minute!
Guess what Musubi told me!
She said you're a\nhigh schooler, Russet!
Are you a model student?
My, you sound confident!
You're really something!
I was concerned that you might\nnot log on during exam season.
But it seems I was worrying\nfor nothing!
Then you might not log on much\nduring exams.
You really ought to prioritize\nyour studies.
Don't go neglecting your\ngrades for our farm!
Sorry for suddenly logging out\nlast time.
I don't think I'll be able\nto help out for a while.
I just need some time\non my own.
Thank you.\nThat's very kind of you.
So... about what Musubi\nsaid about you being\na high schooler...
You just seem like you've got\neverything under control.
Could it be...
I'm the only one who struggles\nto keep it cool!?
I have made a full recovery!
I'm going to make up for\nall the frustration I've been\nmade to feel!
You won't have to worry\nabout me anymore!
There's no turning back!\nBehold! The new Yui is here!
Oh yeah!\nA lady of class always remains\ncalm and collected.
Behold! The new Yui\nis here, bursting with\nserene tranquility!
Actually, I guess that's a bit\nof an oxymoron...
I'll just stick with Yui.\nPlain and simple.
Just watch me!\nI don't need a new name to\nshow you how I've changed!
I do wonder what you think\nof the country life...
Well, it's definitely not\nas convenient.
But it is full of nature,\nwhich is something you don't\ntend to see in the city.
It's no surprise that some\npeople dream of escaping\nto the countryside.
Well, it's very inconvenient\nfor school kids who don't\nhave a driver's license!
If you miss the hourly bus,\nyou'd better be prepared\nto get biking!
Then there's all the bugs...
You'll likely meet more\ncritters than fellow\ncountryfolk!
There's more where that came\nfrom if you're interested!
Musubi's told me so many\nstories about her life\nin the countryside!
Where do you usually\ndo your shopping?
Not virtually,\nI mean in real life.
Ah, somewhere nice and close!
I'm the same!
Oooh, that's where\nMusubi works!
I've heard there are tons\nof shops there!
That reminds me.\nSome of my furniture,\nand even tools are broken.
I bought them forever ago.
No wonder they're\nall falling apart!
They're no use to me anymore.\nI need to buy new ones!
So many things to buy...
'Cause I need a new vacuum\ncleaner and a kettle too!\nLife is hard.
Do you have any shops\nyou'd recommend?
I see!
I heard that there are a lot\nof electronics stores there!
That's all real world\nbusiness, so I'll ask\nMusubi to go!
Great idea!
I don't have to go out,\nand I can really take my time\nto think and choose!
Hey, Russet.
Let's go shopping\ntogether sometime!
I'm super curious to learn\nmore about your taste!
I've been wondering...
When we first met,\nwhat did you think of me?
That's it?
You didn't think I was\nweird or annoying?
If not, then awesome!
I'm a bit worried...
That you might be forcing\nyourself to spend time\nwith me.
You have no idea how happy\nI am to hear that!
Well, since I asked...
It's only fair if I tell you\nwhat I thought of you, too!
My first impression\nof you was...
That you seem pretty...\nabsent-minded?
You're not very excitable, and\nyou don't talk much either.
Oh, really?\nI'm sorry about that.
But my impression of you\nhas changed!
You may be the quiet type,\nbut I know there's a lot going\non in that mind of yours.
You're thoughtful\nand passionate.
You also have a great\nsense of humor.
Perhaps I'm complimenting you\nway too much!
Before we harvest the cyber\nwatermelons, I have to ask...
Do you eat yours with salt?
A long time ago, I sprinkled\nsome on a friend's watermelon.
Things got tense between us.
I had no idea that there were\npeople who prefer it without.
I'm glad I asked!\nI like mine with salt.
I'll make sure not to\nput any on yours.
It's a good thing I checked\nto be sure!
Food grudges can last\nan entire lifetime,\nyou know!
But in my defense...
The salt incident\nI mentioned earlier...
It happened back when\nI was a wee sprout!
It's not as if I go round\nseasoning my coworkers'\nlunches at the office!
I'm not that kind of person.\nDon't get the wrong idea!
Of course! Even I was\na child once, you know.
Just because I'm a resident\nof this virtual world...
...it doesn't mean\nyou don't change.
Th-That's the name of\nmy old guild! The Office!
We're always discussing food!
Anyway! No surprise pinch\nof salt on your watermelon.
You may rest assured!
Hello. Thank you\nfor the other day.
The basil grew very well.
I cooked with it today!
Ah, excuse me!
Actually, I'm making pasta\nwith Musubi right now.
She's treating me to dinner!
I guess I'm starting to\npick up her speaking habits...
Pay no mind to\nthose messages!
P.S.
I recall telling you\nsome time back
that I can't be in the\nsame place as Musubi.
So you might be wondering\nhow we're eating together...
But that rule only applies\nto eating out.
Musubi and I can share a meal\nsince we're at her place!
Oh, you're so pure!
I hope you stay that way!
In that case, forget about\nwhat I said back then!
Also, it's not a "thing"\nI'll have you know!
In any case, let us not\nworry over such details!
What matters right now is\nhow good this pasta tastes\nwith basil!
Is there anything you want to\ndo besides farming, Russet?
Within the virtual world,\nI mean!
Of course, if you want to talk\nabout real life, I'm all ears!
When did you come to enjoy\nfarming this much?
Well then, let's focus on\nexpanding our fields!
Not here in the virtual world?
I can't do that right now,\nI'm afraid.
But I will consider it.
Once we recreate my hometown\nin the virtual world...
Why don't we do your\nneighborhood next?
We still have a ways to go\nbefore that, though!
But when the time comes...
I'll have to go see what\nyour town looks like!
After all, the best way\nto recreate something is\nto see it with your own eyes!
I'll be counting on you\nto show me around.
It's a promise!
Want to try Harvest World\nOnline? It's free to play!
Sign up now and get\na free plot of land!
Hello there!\nAre you free at the moment?\nCause I sure am!
Allow me to show you\naround this world!
Then I'll see you online!
That's too bad.\nMaybe another time!
This is a message from\nthe admin of Harvest\nWorld Online.
There is currently an outbreak\nof potato moles! For those\nof you with farms, be careful.
Hey, I've got a favor to ask,\nRusset!
I'd like to visit your room!
...By which I mean your\nvirtual room, of course!
Great! Let me know when you're\nall set up!
Ah, that's too bad.\nWell, lemme if you\nchange your mind.
{NAME1}-kun?\nYou free now?
So, that thing you taught me\nthe other day... I can't seem\nto get it right on my own.
Mind showing me again?\nWhen you have time, of course!
Thanks! You're a lifesaver!
(Hold Mode: Reply Later)
{NAME1}-kun?\nIs now a good time?
I'm actually heading out\nshopping soon. But it's gonna\nbe quite a trek...
What I'm after isn't available\nnearby, you see. Wanna come\nwith me?
Great! I'll wait at the front\nof the shop!
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.\nWhat kind of mocktail sounds\ngood right about now?
I see. Thanks!
I'm thinking up some\nnew recipes, so this'll help\ngive me some ideas.
I'll let you try what\nI've come up with\nnext time you're here!
Also, anything come to mind\nthat's popular with\nhigh schoolers these days?
I wanna try making\nmocktails that appeal\nto younger customers.
Cool. I'll see what\nI can do...
Thanks so much!\nYou've been a huge help!
You won't believe this,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
Oh, no, it's nothing serious.\nMy body's just aching\nall over.
I went a bit too hard with my\nflair bartending practice and\nnow my limbs are killing me...
I wonder if I'll even be able\nto work properly tomorrow...\nSorry, just wanted to vent!
You know how bartending\nis a standing job, right?
But it's worse for me since\nI do flair bartending.
So it's even more tiring...
I used to have more stamina\nwhen I was in college...\nProbably because I did dance.
Like at a gym? I guess, but I\nfind it hard to stay motivated\nwhen working out alone...
Hm... Yeah, maybe.
You do have a point, though.\nI should get in a workout\nor two somehow!
I'll give it some thought.\nThanks for hearing me out!
Many of our regulars are\nfriends with the owner.
They're all old people too.\nI'm glad we're getting more\ncustomers younger than me.
Yup. It means we're getting\nmore customers. I can't\ncomplain about that!
I'm thinking we should add\nmore mocktails to the menu.
I hope that attracts more\nteenagers like you and\nothers who can't drink.
I'll think up a bunch of tasty\nmocktail recipes!
Recently, I've been watching\ntons of dance videos online.
Some of them only use the\nupper body. Maybe I could use\nthem in my flair bartending.
A lot of them are pretty cute\ntoo with these unique poses.
Really? I'm glad to hear that.
You know, I learned\na bunch of different\ndances back in college.
There was this one time we had\nto perform something right out\nof The Arabian Nights.
We all even had to make\nmatching costumes.\nIt took a lot of work.
I might still have some\ncostumes back home.\nI can teach you!
Smartphones are so handy,\nright? You can watch videos\nand record videos of your own.
I've been testing out\nrecording my flair bartending\npractice from various angles.
And it's been\nsuper-duper helpful.
I can instantly check\nwhat I'm doing well\nor getting wrong.
Well, I was wearing my\ntracksuit, so I don't know\nif I want to show you that...
Sure am, haha! But I'm glad to\nhear you say that, thanks.
Anyway, I have a favor to ask.\nWould you mind recording me?
I want to watch myself from my\ncustomers' perspective, to see\nif I need to work on anything.
I'll hand you my phone\nthe next time you're here.\nHelp me out, will you?
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nhave you tried making that\nmocktail recipe I taught you?
Great! As your mocktail\nmentor, I'm glad to see\nyou put in the effort.
Knowing you as well as I do,\nI knew you wouldn't\ndisappoint!
If you don't get something,\nfeel free to ask me for help\nanytime.
Oh, right! I'll take you\nto one of our suppliers\nnext time.
Right, you do need some\nspecific ones. I'll take you\nshopping next time!
I'm so happy that you're\nmaking my mocktails,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
I'll try to help you\nas much as I can!
I thought I was getting\na little out of shape.
That's why I started working\nout not too long ago.
My belly flab's all gone!\nIt feels incredible.
Aww, you're making me blush.\nBut go on! Keep the\ncompliments flowing!
I even have alcohol-free\ndays so I can really\ngive it my all.
Hehe, more! Praise me more!
Just kidding. I'm responsible;\nI won't let it go to my head.
That reminds me...\nYou enjoy sports and stuff,\nright {PLAYER_NAME}-kun?
I'd love to hear about your\ntraining regimen sometime.
Lately, I've been taking\nthis boxercise class\nat the gym I'm going to.
It's basically training\nthat incorporates\nboxing techniques...
We have to do all these quick\nmoves, but it's super fun!
The gym has other courses too.\nThey're so much better than\njust running on a treadmill!
You know, they even\nhave dance courses\nlike jazz and hula.
I was thinking it might\nbe nice to dance again.
I might try next time I go.
Right? I was thinking\nthe same!
Well now I want to try\neven harder!
Talking to you never fails\nto motivate me.
I'm going to do whatever\nI can to level up!
I've added a lot of mocktail\nrecipes to my repertoire.
But it could be nice to pair\nthem with some food.
Is that what people who\ndon't drink tend to prefer?
Right, since alcohol isn't\nthe focus, I could serve the\nmocktails as part of a meal.
I'm glad I talked it out\nwith you.
I'm starting to think\na full meal would sell\nbetter than snacks.
That said, we're not a\nrestaurant. We can't\nmake anything too fancy.
I'll try talking to the owner\nand the other bartenders.
Your feedback's been\nvery helpful. Thank you!
Can you cook,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-kun?
Oh, I had a feeling\nyou'd say that!
I'm... not terrible, I think.
Most of my repertoire\nconsists of bar snacks.\nI don't cook at home at all.
What kind of dishes\ndo you like to cook?
Hehe, sounds good to me!\nRice bowls with toppings\nof the day, huh...?
Yeah, they are pretty easy.\nAnd healthy to boot.
Maybe I was aiming too high\nwith the bar menu.
I think I'll start with some\neasy-to-serve items.
Heeeyyyyyy!
You there?\nWakey-wakey!\n\xa1Buenos d\xedas!
Hahaha!
I'm in a good mood and\nthought I'd text you!
The world's spinning\nround and round!
I'm spinning too! Haha! Whee!
Wheeeeee!!!
What a great day!
See youuuuuu!
Salutations,\n{PLAYER_NAME}-sama.
I just saw the gibberish\nI sent you last time.
As you can probably tell,\nI was very drunk back then.
I don't even remember sending\nthem, to be honest.
I'm very VERY sorry you\nhad to deal with that...
I'm sure drunk me would\nbe happy to hear that.
Hey!\nI'm a beautiful lady\u2014not cute!
Still, thanks for making this\nwhole thing into a fun memory.
Ugh, I can't believe myself...
I hope you won't follow in my\nfootsteps once you're older.\nDrink responsibly!
Lately, I've been trying my\nhand at making a bunch of\nnew cocktails and mocktails.
Now I feel like I've gained\nweight from all the\ntaste-testing I'm doing.
I'll make up for it with\nmore workouts!
Yeah, it sure is.
I know you can't drink,\nbut you should come\nto the bar sometime.
Nah, forget it. I'm the adult\nhere. I can't be relying\non you all the time.
Oh, you're always so smooth.
I don't know how you do it...
\xa1Buenas noches!\nNi hao!\nHiiiii!
Ugh, I can't take it anymore!
I wanna see youuu!
I wish you'd come by\nmy work more!
Okay, but!
I really mean it!
Also, for the record...
I'm not drunk tonight!
Ahhh! I said it!\nOkay, bye bye!
So {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\ndo you come to Shibuya a lot?
Cool, me too.
It's the perfect place to go\nto busk it out, y'know?
If you see me there again,\nfeel free to say hi!
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nyou play bass, right?
Why'd you pick\nthat instrument?
Oh! Bass is pretty hard\nthough! That's impressive.
It'd be cool to play\nwith you sometime.
I feel like every time\nwe see each other,\nyou end up helping me out.
I'm really grateful.
At this point, just seeing\nyour face is enough\nto calm my nerves.
I'm gonna keep at it\nfor my street shows!
That first time you listened\nto me sing in the park
I thought my heart was gonna\npop out of my chest.
But it ended up\nbeing really fun!
It reminded me of the first\ntime I sung with my band.
No, thank you for stopping by!
Yeah! You can find me\nin Shibuya.
Speaking of the park
we should go to there\nagain sometime!
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun.
What kinda music are you into?
Yeah, that seems like you.
Yeah, but maybe that's\njust how I see you.
Sorry if that was random!\nBut no real reason...
I'm just a little stuck on the\nsong I'm writing right now.
Thanks for your input!
So I was out busking\nin Shibuya
and some girls around your age\ncame up to listen.
They told me they were fans!
Right? Thanks!
I know you are!\nYou're my first and most\nimportant fan after all.
It's just... it was my first\ntime hearing strangers\ncall themselves fans of mine
so it kinda got me\nall hyped up!
I know that this is\nout of the blue
but thanks for everything.
When I'm feeling down
you're always there\nto lift me up.
So I wanted to say thanks.
Yeah, but I feel like you\nwere the one who gave me\nthe strength to do it.
Yeah, but it's like...\nI'm older than you, y'know!
Anyway...
It's because of you that\nI can stay positive
so thanks.
{PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nyou just started playing\nbass recently, right?
'Cause when we were\nplaying together earlier,\nI was thinking...
you're pretty good at this.
A bassist has always gotta\nbe on point with both\nthe rhythm and root notes.
That makes it a pretty\ndifficult instrument, I think.
I dunno, I tried playing\nmy friend's bass\nback in the day.
But I found it\npretty complex...
That's true. I guess\nevery instrument just\ntakes practice.
Speaking of rehearsals though,\nyou've got some mad tambourine\nskills, too.
I'll have to put in some more\ntime with my guitar if I wanna\nkeep up with you!
So {PLAYER_NAME}-kun...
What do you think about\nwhen you're playing bass?
Hm... Okay, lemme\nrephrase my question.
Remember that bit you\nfreestyled in our last\njam sesh together?
The thing is... I can't get\nthat lick you played out\nof my head.
I wanna come up with catchy\nriffs like that myself too
but I've been trying\nand it's not easy...
Do you remember what was\ngoing through your head\nwhen you did that improv bit?
Ah, so you were thinking\nabout me even during\nyour own solo then...
Gave yourself to\nthe rhythm, huh?
Maybe hearing you play\nwhat you like made me\nenjoy it even more?
Thanks, you've been\na big help!
So, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun,\nabout your band...
You've got guitar, bass,\ndrums, and keys, right?
It's not a big deal\nor anything
but on our trip before,\nwe talked about the songs\nyou play in your club, right?
But like, there were a bunch\nthat I wasn't sure how you\ncould play with that setup.
So I've kinda been wondering\nhow you go about it...
Oh, I see! If it's a synth\nkeyboard, then I guess you\nfour could manage with that.
Maybe the other instruments\nare getting added in post, or\nyou're using a synth keyboard?
I was just curious is all!\nThanks for humoring me.
Being a musician\nis so expensive!
I managed to save up some of\nmy paycheck, so I bought some\npro recording equipment...
Bam, back to zero savings\nwith just a few mouse clicks.
Plus, apartments that\nlet you play music indoors\ndon't come cheap...
Just picturing the numbers\non my next bank statement\nis making me depressed...
Yeah... I'll be fine. It's not\nlike my account's in danger\nof hitting zero or anything.
Nah. It's not like my\naccount is in danger of hitting\nzero or anything. It's just...
I guess that's just the price\nI gotta pay to do what I love.\nI'll pay it off soon enough.
Thanks for listening to my\nwhining. I'll let you know\nwhen my gear arrives!
Remember that recording\nequipment I blew my\npaycheck on?
Well, it's all here now!
A bunch of stuff.\nA new mic, headphones,\nan audio interface...
I even bought this recording\nsoftware that all the pros\nuse. It was pretty pricey tbh!
But that's not all! I also got\na synth keyboard, more cables,\nand some spare strings.
I feel like there's no way\nI can't make some\ngreat music now!
Thanks! Look forward\nto my next song, okay!
It's a symbol of my resolve\nto take music seriously\nfrom now on!
It's all still boxed up\nright now, though...
I'm gonna go unpack\neverything now. I can't\nwait to try it all out!
I told you all the recording\nequipment I ordered\nshowed up, right?
So, I got all the devices\nhooked up to start\ncomposing and recording.
But then the software wouldn't\nlaunch, and my PC wouldn't\ndetect the audio interface...
Every step of the setup,\nI was getting endless\nstupid errors.
I basically had to look up\nevery single fix, but I\ngot it done in the end.
It only took half my life...
Thanks... Now I can finally\nget to the song writing part!
Of course! I haven't been\ndoing all of this for nothing.
I'm really excited to make\nsome new music.
I also can't wait for you\nto hear them!
I've been going to Inokashira\nPark a lot to practice singing\nand playing at the same time.
The strays that live there\nhave started coming over\nto listen to my songs.
They always have. Though that\ncat from last time at the park\nwas one I see pretty often.
Yeah! I usually give\na few pats to the ones\nI recognize.
Anyway, their tails\nstarted bouncing along\nto the rhythm...
It was so CUTE!
Having a feline audience\nfelt kinda weird, but in\na good way.
I just had to text you\nabout it.
Thanks for listening.
Sometimes, when I'm\nworking on a guitar lick\nor my backlog of housework
something totally unrelated\nwill just pop into my head.
Does that happen to you?
You too, huh...\nIsn't it weird!?
Hm, I see. It happens\nto me a lot.
It's like with no warning,\nsome random thought appears\nand totally consumes my brain.
Earlier, I was working out\na riff for a song on the keys\nand suddenly thought of you.
And before I knew it,\nI sent you a text.\nSorry, haha!
Hey, {PLAYER_NAME}-kun!
I finished my new\nsong lyrics!
Or so I'd like to say, but...
I know, right!?\nEspecially since I struggled\na lot with the last one.
I've got a report due soon for\none of my worst classes.
So even though I'm done with\nthe lyrics, I'll have to put\nthe melody writing on hold...
Hopefully, once my report's\ndone, inspiration will strike\nand I can play you the song!
So I was performing in\nShibuya today, right?
And this guy from a record\ncompany asked if I would\nput out a song with them!
Thank you! It's just a small\nindie label, but still.
No, no, it's just with an\nindie label. No big break\nfor me yet.
When we performed that new\nsong, one of the fans took\na video on her phone, right?
Well, apparently she uploaded\nit to a video site, and that's\nhow the record label found me.
Oh, and you know what\nthe record company rep\nsaid to me?
"The dude on the bass was\ngood. Is he in your band?"
So how about it? Wanna form\na duo and debut with me?
If I hear anything more\nfrom them, I'll make sure\nyou're the first to know!
Awesome! I'll be waiting\nat my usual spot.
I wonder what you'd be like\nif you got drunk.
Yeah, I can very easily\nimagine that!
Haha, it's fun to see\nsomeone who's always\nso calm let loose.
But we won't know until\nyou're old enough to drink.
Will you be just the way\nyou are? Will I get to see\na new side of you?
Maybe you'll even\nstart bawling?
I'm looking forward to\ndrinking with you someday.
Promise you'll have your\nfirst drink with me?
Sometimes I think about you...
...and I'd wish you'd\nhurry up and become a\nmature young man already.
Yeah? Guess I can wait\na little longer.
You're definitely mature for\nyour age, but no real adult\nsays that out loud!
You know, if you were older...
...we could be with each other\nuntil morning.
Wait, no! I didn't mean it\nlike that!
Like, when you drink mocktails\nwith me, you have to go home\nbefore it's too late, right?
Once you're a grown-up though,\nwe can drink the night away.
Hehehe, don't take me\ntoo seriously.
But do give it some thought\nonce the time comes,\nwill you?
But Mom said I can't go\nunless I'm with an adult.
Will you come with me,\n{NAME2}?
Thanks! I'll be waiting\noutside the diner.
Hey, are you free today,\n{NAME2}?
I was thinking of studying\nat the diner.
Could you help me go over\nmy math textbook again?
C'mon, let's study together,\n{NAME2}!
Yay! I'll wait for you\noutside the diner!
Are you mastering Persona fusion?
It is required to\nfulfill our contract.\nPlease do not neglect it.
The process of fusion and\nskill inheritance undoubtfully\ndemonstrates its complexity...
I am here to support you. In\nreturn, I ask that you apply\nyourself diligently each day.
Yup!
Wrong number.
Let me check my schedule.
I'm doing fine.
It really doesn't.
Shouldn't take too long.
Probably tomorrow?
Great work today, everyone.
We did it!
So the change of heart worked.
On my way.
See you there.
Goodnight.
See you tomorrow.
He offered me a job.
Of course I'll go.
Can Lufel come too?
It definitely is.
Even indirectly...
By all means.
I'm curious about them, too.
You a talent scout now?
I'd like to see her play.
I sure have.
But things are getting tough.
You bet I do.
Yeah, I'm kinda curious.
I'll teach you.
I'm terrible at math, too.
Appreciate it.
You know it.
Doesn't mean things are easy.
On my phone.
Thinking about life.
But we're Phantom Thieves?
We got interviewed?
Amazing.
Sounds like a great goal.
Romance.
You should try horror.
That's random.
Are they your favorite?
Just burn it off.
Uh, it's due tomorrow.
Bad news...
I'll give you some pointers.
I'll show you how to do them.
Warming up your feet helps.
Try eating dinner early.
Hey, take it easy.
Have trouble sleeping?
Are you feeling sick?
Just get a late train slip.
Train's fault, so you're safe.
You miss baseball?
You regret quitting?
That is really sudden.
Is there someone you admire?
That's what "admire" means.
You're a funny one.
Love you, sweetie.
Sorry about the joke.
My bad.
It's like that for everyone.
Act the way you wanna be seen.
How did you learn them?
That's 'cause it's your hobby.
I haven't done it yet.
What was the question?
You take things so seriously.
Focus on the biggest thing.
How'd it go?
Nothing wrong with crying.
Let's get stronger together.
I'm listening.
What sort of movie is it?
Can't even imagine.
Great for emotional training.
Soda's got you trapped.
Wanna dash to a diner?
No, I didn't.
What were they talking about?
I'd go for it.
I'm down.
I need to check my schedule.
They are reliable allies.
SQUEE!!!
She's not the real deal?
Does that count as an idol?
If you say so.
She was cute.
You have a point.
Sounds like work...
I wouldn't go that far...
Almost a full-fledged fan!
Is that how it works?
You just want to convert me.
This again...?
I wouldn't know.
Their names end with -man.
They're called Rangers.
He's going down.
Let's save Naruru.
Did you say hi?
So she's working there?
That's the right thing to do.
You're a model fan.
What a cultured woman you are.
How far will you go?
I can't decide.
I'm not familiar with it.
I don't know...
What about idols?
Did it 'cause you told me to.
Anything for Naruru.
He was never a bad guy.
He got a bit screwy.
How about "friends"?
Idol group fan?
A unit name?
Mariyan?
Shiyurin?
You've gone beyond fandom.
Cheater...
No longer a fan of Naruru?
It's not a dream.
It's okay to dream.
Of course you were.
Where'd this all come from?
I'm grateful to you too.
You've changed too, Merope.
Lemme get back to you.
You shoulda said hi!
You ignored me? Ouch.
Mine aren't.
Take care!
You're an oddball.
The guy who gets bullied?
No way. You know too?
I use a different method.
There's an easier way.
Aliases?
Like code names?
Darkness?
Prince?
I have stuff to do.
You watch it first.
You're chickening out?
Is it really cursed?
The what?
Sounds kind of familiar.
It's not an optical illusion?
It's probably been edited.
Dog-faced man?
What was that again?
It happens.
Case closed!
Uh-huh?
Be strong, stand your ground!
I'll negotiate with it.
Must've been a fake grimoire.
Maybe you read it wrong?
Which is it?
Are you prepared?
A handkerchief!
I get that.
Are you giving up?
It sure did!
So the day has finally come...
Now the fun begins!
A place by the station.
A stylist in my neighborhood.
You care about fashion?
Will that really help?
What brought this up?
So you understand, then?
Exactly, Prince of Darkness.
Did they show up?
Not a demon?
Good work!
I'm impressed.
What kind of impediment?
Says who?
You're surprisingly popular!
Classic chosen one stuff.
You must be good at English.
Be my overseas tour guide!
My homeroom teacher is.
I'll whip you into shape!
The pay's gotta be good.
Gotta be easy work.
Yeah, quite a lot lately.
She does most of the talking.
I can make whatever I like.
I just order whatever I want.
Ones by famous directors!
Comedies all the way.
Whatever I feel like!
Well, I'm always free to chat.
Works for me.
You all good now?
That's really nice of you.
I'm sure they'll be thrilled.
I guess they want you to pick.
You should trust your taste.
Keep talking...
You've piquant-ed my interest.
20-20 vision.
Well, I couldn't tell.
Maybe training might help?
Just call me sensei.
Me? Teaching?
How was it in baseball?
Try teaching by example.
Congratulations!
Good job, Teach.
Coach Tomoko in the house!
I'd love to join in next time.
Not that I know of.
Who's asking?
Sell it at a flea market!
Donate it to your old team.
That's great!
If you have no regrets, sure.
That is pretty incredible!
At the hospital?
Hope you get to talk to him!
Ask for his autograph!
It's good that you went.
How could I forget?
Did you get to meet him?
Good thing you spoke up.
So, about that autograph?
Will they be enough?
Something from the heart!
One that'll pump her up.
Where'd you hear that?
She can skate to that...?
What an honor.
Feeling nervous about it?
Like us.
And how does Kotone feel?
Sure, I can help.
Sorry, kinda busy...
Not in particular.
I have a couple products.
Really? I had no idea.
Aww, I want cheap burgers.
Emailing friends...?
Yeah, sorta.
Put it on my phone case.
Attach it to something else.
You didn't take any pics?
We should go to one together.
Secret frames?
Codes?
Maybe an e-reader app?
Put some games on it.
I dunno, that seems kinda far.
The convenience store's close.
The savings aren't that much.
Getting there costs money too.
Well, we are close in age.
We're both guys, so...
What are you, his mom?
We don't need babysitting...
Take any good pictures?
Use any good filters?
Right on my phone case.
My notebooks or my planner.
I'm alone for a while, yeah.
Yup. They're such lovebirds.
It's fun!
I'm fine, I have friends.
I'm just living my life.
I've got it covered.
Who are you, my mom?
It was nothing, really.
I'm glad I could help.
Night shifts, you know?
Sorry, I can't divulge that.
Things have come full circle.
History repeats itself.
I like arts and crafts.
I make a pretty mean omelette.
Have any high school hobbies?
You should try something new.
All the time.
I treasure them.
You'd be doing me a favor!
I dunno about that...
Can't beat a dog's loyalty.
I prefer cats.
I have an owl, actually.
Just some plants.
How about potted flowers?
Could grow some veggies?
I'm grateful for it.
You can be a handful.
What's this recipe for?
Is this a shopping list?
Go to the drugstore.
Try the convenience store.
Light.
Heavy.
Like, soybeans?
Your code name?
Wouldn't call it a side dish.
You'd get tired of it.
Some countries do.
Don't talk about school much?
What do you discuss?
What did you tell her?
Because we're friends?
I'd like to visit.
Cold noodles.
Ramen.
Ever tried rice?
Don't forget the dessert.
Japanese loanword, right?
I'm amazed by your knowledge.
How about "naan bread"?
About the sauce?
That stuff on etymology?
You sure like to study.
Does this help you cook?
Random.
You figured it out.
When're you making me some?
I vote courage.
Hunger is the best spice.
It made a huge impact, huh?
Sounds unreal.
They didn't work out?
Hey, it happens.
Time to experiment.
The wonders of fermentation.
How did it go?
You have a ways to go?
Leave it to me, partner.
Only if you pay.
Tell me.
Why's that?
Sounds wise.
I'm just listening.
Got your thoughts sorted?
Don't forget your goal.
"Contrary to expectations."
Well, you come off as serious.
It's fun talking with you.
Maybe you've changed.
Uh, okay.
It's kinda short notice...
Sure...
Well, I'm never late...
Can't get enough.
If I'm super bored.
Sounds interesting.
I'm kind of curious now.
Does authentic mean spicy?
I guess?
Like it's my job.
Colorful ones.
Only the best quality.
They're even more convenient!
They're easy to use.
Lay a good one on me.
Same here.
That counts as studying!
There's more important things.
Maybe he's taking a back seat?
He respects your independence?
That'd be quite the trip.
Both would be no mean feat.
No doubt.
Totally.
Anyone would feel the same.
It's a matter of restraint.
That's okay for now.
Focus on conveying your thoughts.
Where's this coming from?
That's pretty heavy.
One step closer to adulthood.
Empathy is important.
As long as you learn from it.
Sounds good to me!
Just take it slow, okay?
Do you see yourself in them?
Do you want to live here?
I'll have to get back to you.
You surprised me.
Summer?
Winter?
I need time to prepare.
I'm bad with jokes.
Apples.
Mandarins.
I admire it.
How's it differ to the city?
Near my house.
In Shibuya.
Try Akihabara.
Just get 'em online.
That you were interesting.
Wow, she's peppy.
I like spending time with you.
I like you the way you are.
Cause you do all the talking.
You're the energetic one.
You were once a wee sprout?
You're an office worker?
Who dis?
You've got the wrong number!
Oh, I see!
I forgot that was a thing.
Let's farm together forever.
I'd like to meet you IRL.
That'd be great!
Can't today, sorry...
Sure, no problem.
Reply later
Something refreshing.
Something sweet.
Watching videos online.
Mobile games.
You could work out.
Why not dance again?
Business must be booming.
Makes me feel welcome.
I'm sure it will.
I think that could work.
I want to see.
That sounds fun.
I'd like to try.
Do you take videos?
Is that useful?
I wanna see your videos!
You're really working hard.
I've been practicing at home.
I don't have the ingredients.
I'm missing some tools.
You're one hard worker.
Proud of you!
Queen of all bartenders!
Fun should be number one.
You should try them all out.
It'd help with your work.
Can't wait to see your moves.
You should do something rich.
Something filling sounds nice.
Sure can!
Define "cook."
I just throw stuff on rice.
Hot pots are my go-to.
I can imagine.
Like a record.
"Salutations"?
It was funny.
You were cute.
You look fine to me.
I don't mind at all.
Bring on the taste-test-athon!
Sorry...
I will, I will.
Sure do.
Yeah, it's close to my school.
I just wanted to try it out.
I kind of stumbled into it...
Just doing my part.
Thanks for the show.
Looking forward to next time!
Songs that pump me up.
Chill beats.
Does it now?
I'm your fan too.
You're welcome?
You lifted yourself up.
I couldn't just leave you.
It's easier than it looks.
I guess practice paid off.
It's hard to put into words.
Nothing in particular...
I wanted to impress you.
I gave myself to the rhythm.
What about it?
Our keyboardist works hard.
I don't really know either.
Is it?
You okay there?
Regretting your purchases?
Nice.
What did you get?
Isn't that all a bit much?
Yeah, I remember.
Was there a problem?
Ready to start writing songs?
Cats really like you, huh?
Stray cats!?
Not that I can think of...
I want to hear it!
You're done already!?
Could this be your big break!?
Thanks, but...
I think I'd be relaxed.
I'd probably go off the walls.
I will in a few years.
I'm already grown up.
Why not start now?
We'd just drink?
I'll be right there.
Kinda busy right now.
Be right there.
Sorry, I'm busy.
I'm a pro.
It's not easy...
