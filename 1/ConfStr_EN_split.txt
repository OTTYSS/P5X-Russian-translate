Hmm... Did you hear what those shadows said?
Hmm... Doesn't seem to be many enemies around.
Hmm... Intriguing.
Hmm... Seems like we can't get in this way.
Hmm... we can use this space.
Hmm... We could try changing spots.
Hmm? Something caught my eye...
Hmm? There's something different about this one!
Hmm? Who are you?
Hmmm, gettin' some "secret passage" vibes here!

Hunt for treasure
Hurry up and follow them.
I am at your command!
I am indeed ready.
I am now able to go\nto Shibuya! I should go\nwhen I get some time.
I am the guardian of\nthis castle.
I blew it...
I can fight too.
I can see it now... Victory is in sight!
I can take the lead. Let's go!
I can't move with this wind... Sorry, but I'm leaving this to you!
I can't stand loud noises!
I cannot betray\nKiuchi-sama's trust...
I could collect some more.
I could use a rest.
I detect a hidden passage. Try to find it.
I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.
I did my best! What did you think, big bro?
I did the best I could, I suppose.
I didn't know there was\na safe room here...
I don't have time right now.
I don't have time today.
I don't know where they are.
I don't really like it. Give it to someone else.

I don't wanna do\nanything that's gonna\nget us killed...
I don't want to up and give up right in the middle, but... I guess there's no other way.
I doubt there's anyone\nslacking off...
I feel a breeze... Is there a hidden path there?
I feel like there's a hidden passage here.
I feel we are being guided by the unseen...
I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here somewhere.\n...Or not.
I got careless...
I got careless... Focus on healing!
I got this!
I got you.
I had fun today! Thanks.
I have a bad feeling about this...\nIt's a trap! Everyone, be careful.
I have no objections. I shall do as instructed.
I have other plans.
I have other things to do.
I haven't even gotten\nstarted yet.
I haven't had enough yet! I still want to keep defeating foes. Will you join me?
I hear wind... There might be a hidden passage nearby.
I heard something...
I heard your call!
I hope it's something good.
I hope this can provide some fleeting amusement.
I just checked\nover there.
I just want to punch\nsomething... A thief or a brat,\nanything will do...
I knew it had to be this way
I know how to solve this.
I let my guard down... The rest is up to you!
I look forward to working with you all!
I lost them...
I made other plans...
I may need to pace myself...
I messed up!
I might not make it...
I must fulfill my duty!
I need to go somewhere else...
I need to let loose!
I need to maintain\nthis figure...
I need to report this\nto Kiuchi-sama.
I need to work\nharder next time...
I pledge my loyalty\nto Miyazawa-sama...
I really hope it's something good!
I request an explanation...
I saw it! There was\nsomething over there\njust now!
I saw that one coming from miles away.
I saw your face!
I sealed the deal, huh?
I see, an interesting lineup...
I see... A tactical retreat...
I see... I'll return immediately.
I sense a formidable enemy approaching.\nIs it time to use... that power?
I sense a most excellent harvest!
I sense treasure! Should we look around?
I sense treasure...
I should report to Merope\nthat we changed the corrupt\nproducer's heart...
I should spend time\nwith Kira today...
I should spend time\nwith Miyu today...
I smell treasure!
I suggest we take a break.
I suppose we should get serious, then.
I think I can do it.
I think I just saw a treasure chest around here...
I think I'd better take it easy this week.\nLet's give it a shot next week.
I think I'm a bit tired...
I think it'd go well, but... Okay, I'll go back and rest.
I think that's enough for\ntoday. All in moderation,\nright?
I think that's enough\nfor today. All in moderation,\nright?
I think there's a passage nearby...
I thought I saw\nsomething...
I trust you.
I wanna be like\nKiuchi-sama...
I wanna be\na starter...
I wanna go to Kira's place.
I wanna keep going till the end next time!
I wanna know what's inside.
I wanna see Kiuchi-sama\nplay with my\nown eyes...
I want to be\nKiuchi-sama's favorite...
I want to come back and play again!
I want to take a\nbreak soon...
I wanted to keep going until the end...
I wanted to see it through till the end...
I was careless.
I was getting restless.
I will protect everyone...!
I will protect this...\nIt's my job...
I wish I could play\nwith Kiuchi-sama...
I won't betray your expectations!
I won't hold back!
I won't let you down.
I won't let you escape!
I won't let you escape,\nyou little thieves!
I won't let you go!
I won't let you petty\nthieves escape!
I won't let you\nslip away...!
I wonder if I'll see\nKiuchi-sama today.
I wonder if there's\nanything fun to do...
I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.
I wonder what'll happen today. I can't wait!
I wonder what's inside!
I wonder what's inside.
I wonder what's inside. Let's see!
I'd like to heal up, if we have a chance...
I'll admit you're good... but you're not on my level.
I'll be the ground to your feet!
I'll catch anything you\nthrow at me.\nBring it on!
I'll chase you\nwherever you go!
I'll curse you...
I'll do my best to keep up.
