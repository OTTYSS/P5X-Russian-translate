A bluish-tinged diamond that Napoleon Bonaparte had mounted to the pommel of his sword. It was named after the French Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orleans, who had purchased it in 1717.
The diamond necklace that Jeanne de la Motte swindled from jewelers in 1785 by claiming it was on behalf of the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette.
Also known as the Stone of Destiny,it is a stone used in the coronations of Scotland's monarchs. Legends say the stone is linked to angels.
Once called the world's largest diamond, it was cut when it came to the British royal family. It is said to bring bad luck to any man who wears it, so only the females have ever adorned it.
A diamond stolen from a Hindu temple that is said to drive its owner to their death. It was cut into smaller pieces in an attempt to break the curse.
Also known as Charlemagne's talisman, it is said to make its owner an emperor. In between the two gems is a piece of Jesus' cross and a hair of the Virgin Mary.
Unlike its name suggests, the Hope Diamond is a cursed jewel that brings ruin from one owner to the next. A few supposed victims include King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette.
An ancient Out-Of-Place-Artifact found in Central and South America. It is said that if you collect 13 of them in one spot, the truth of the universe will be revealed.
