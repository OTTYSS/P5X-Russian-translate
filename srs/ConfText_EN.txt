About Refunds
About Charges
<sprite=0 tint=1> During the Persona5: The Phantom X trial period, the total amount charged will be refunded after the game's official release according to the Charge Refund Rules.
About charge refund rules
Basic charge refund rules
<color=#EADE10></color>During the Phantom Thief trial period, the total amount charged (including through Marthym's Rewards Card, Premium Pass, Premium Pass +, and any direct Gift Pack purchases) will be returned at a rate of {1} {0} = 10 Cognition Crystals. The specific return range and rules are as follows:\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>400%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>300%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>200%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0} - {1}{0} </color>: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>150%%</color>.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>If the amount charged is <color=#EADE10>{1}{0}</color> or more: Cognition Crystals returned at a rate of <color=#EADE10>130%%</color>.
Refund Example
Even if {1}{0} were charged in the Phantom Thief Trial, a total of 92,625 Cognition Crystals will be returned after the release version starts. The return calculations are broken down as follows:\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0}  returned: (30\xd710 <color=#EADE10>400%%</color>) = 1200 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (170\xd710 <color=#EADE10>300%%</color>) = 5100 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (1800\xd710 <color=#EADE10>200%%</color>) = 3600 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} - {1}{0} returned: (3000\xd710<color=#EADE10>150%%</color>) = 4500 Cognition Crystals.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>{1}{0} or more returned: (415\xd710 <color=#EADE10>130%%</color>) = 5395 Cognition Crystals.\nTotal: 1200 + 5100 + 3600 + 4500 + 5395 = 92,695 Cognition Crystals
Marthym's Rewards Card Return Rules
<sprite=0 tint=1>If a Marthym's Rewards Card was purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period, Cognition Crystals will be returned after the official release according to [Rule 1] based on the amount charged for the Marthym's Rewards Card. Marthym's Rewards Cards will also be returned based on the amount of Marthym's Rewards Cards purchased.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>Returns are limited to a maximum of <color=#EADE10>2</color> Marthym's Rewards Cards. If one Marthym's Rewards Card was purchased during the trial period, one Marthym's Rewards Card will be returned after the official release, and if two were purchased, two will be returned. If more than two Marthym's Rewards Card were purchased, only two will be returned; however, the amount charged <color=#EADE10>will count</color> toward the Cognition Crystal returns for [Rule 1].
Refund Example
If four 30-yuan Marthym's Rewards Cards were purchased during the trial period, the amount charged will be 120 yuan, and Cognition Crystals will be returned after the game's release in accordance with [Rule 1]. The player will also receive two Marthym's Rewards Cards. (Cognition  Crystals received through Marthym's Rewards Card won't be counted toward returns for [Rule 1].)
Phantom Pass Refund Rules
For Phantom Passes purchased during the Phantom Thief trial period, Cognition Crystals will be returned after the official release based on the amount charged for Phantom Passes in accordance with [Rule 1]. Based on the charges, the player will also <color=#EADE10>receive the Phantom Pass items for free</color>.
Refund Example
<sprite=0 tint=1>During the trial period, Player A purchased a {1}{0} Premium Pass. As this {1}{0} <color=#EADE10>will be regarded as the amount charged</color>, Player A will have Cognition Crystals returned after release in accordance with [Rule 1], and receive a free Premium Pass.\n<sprite=0 tint=1>During the trial period, Player B used a {1}{0} Premium Pass and purchased a Premium Pass + for {1}{0}. As the amount charged equals <color=#EADE10>{1}{0}</color>, Player B will have Cognition Crystals returned after release in accordance with [Rule 1] and <color=#EADE10>receive a free</color> Premium Pass +.\n\nAbove are details on the Phantom Thief Trial Return Rules.
