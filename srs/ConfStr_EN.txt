Pretty smooth, human.
Do your best!
Looks pretty handy!
Nicely done!
Excellent positioning.
That's great! Don't give up yet!
That was a piece of cake!
Prerequisite not unlocked.
That's right! Good grief!
This is gettin' me pumped up!
Oh, how clever.
Good move.
Well done!
All right, way to go!
Wonderful!
Amazing!
Ugh... failed...
C'mon, keep it together!
So disappointing...
Dang...
Made a mistake there?
Think over it harder!
That doesn't sound bad at all.
I could collect some more.
Picked up something good.
Dang... You're good!
Looks we've gotten our hands on a fair amount of funds.
Don't forget to trade your items!
Huh... Not bad.
Now for the important part.

It seems the way has been opened.
Now we can keep going.
Now's your chance to get through.
Don't give up hope over one defeat!
Be more careful next time!
Hoo boy... That was a total failure.
Perhaps a change of strategy is in order.
C'mon, use your brain.
Why not give it another try?

Whoa, a new record! That's our Captain!
Looks like you've hit a plateau for now...\nDon't worry, I'm sure you can get an even\nhigher score next time!
Wow, you set a new record! Amazing...\nYou truly are amazing!
I'm afraid you haven't set a new record...\nLet's rethink our strategy.
You... You broke a new record!\nCongratulations! This is a tremendous\naccomplishment!
Unfortunate... but it's all right. I'll break the record next time!
Oho, a new record! Next time we return,\nramen's on me!
It would seem that you require more training.\nPlease take on the challenge again once your\ndesire has further grown.
You've broken a new record...! As your\nreceptionist, I feel truly proud!
Hmm, well, I guess we did okay, but let's try\nharder next time.
Hoo hoo! A new high score, pretty good!

I'd like to heal up, if we have a chance...
Stay alert!
We've arrived?
No harm in taking a break...
We can rest here safely.
A Shadow is about.
Locked...
Finished.
This might have something valuable.
Let's take it.
Are there any other infiltration points?
Looks like this is the place.
It's locked...?
What are the contents?
It's impossible from here.\nNo need to waste our effort.
Finished.
Let's head home.
Take heed... it would be best to heal.
I suggest we take a break.
I sense treasure...
Seems to be teeming with Shadows...
There don't seem to be many Shadows around...
Did you neglect to claim that treasure chest?
I'm detecting a trap...
I know how to solve this.
Something's not right... Stay alert!
We've been putting in a considerable amount of effort...\nShall we rest for a moment?
Ugh... I'm exhausted...
Keep your head in the game!
Are we there yet?
Want to take a quick break?
Phew, we can finally take a breather...
Here comes a Shadow...
It won't open...
Got it!
Anyone else have a good feeling about this one?
Should we take it?
Is there anywhere we can go?
Where are we...?
Shall we check somewhere else?
What's in there?
Should we head back for now?
Huh? That one looks tough! Look out!
Mmm...\nHey, how about we take a little break?
AAAAAA==
Let's go!
Looks like we're here!
Hey, found a good spot!
Time to take a breather!
You kids are a bunch of bats... what was it again?
Huh, it's not opening?
Yeah, perfect!
I think I just saw a treasure chest around here...
Nice! Found a treasure!
Hey, doesn't it feel like there'd be a secret passage around here?
We're here! We're here!
Looks like there's no other entrance...
Lemme see, lemme see!
Let's run that one again!
We gotta take this more seriously...!
Hey, better watch out for heatstroke!\nMake sure you stay hydrated!
I-I'm a bit tired...
Let's do our best today, too!
This is where we were headed.
I didn't know there was\na safe room here...
Should we take a break?
There's a Shadow, be careful!
This door is locked.\nIt can't be helped; we'll\nhave to find a way around.
Justice has been served! *giggle* Our job is done!
There's something that looks important.
Oh my! Wonderful!
I feel like there's a hidden passage here.
We're here. What do we do now?
It's no use... This won't open.
*giggle* My heart is racing.
Well then, good day.
It looks really strong...\nMake sure to prepare.
Everyone seems tired...\nHow about some tea?
*sigh* I'm beat...
*giggle* I'm itching for action. Let's do this!
We're here! This is our destination, right?
This is a nice spot for a safe room!
Hey, let's take a break here.
There's a Shadow. Be careful!
It's locked. Let's\ncome back later.
Phew, job's done.
What's that?
Finders keepers!
Huh? Do you feel a draft?
We're here. Now what do we do?
This door doesn't look like it opens.
*giggle* What's inside?
Nice going.
Doesn't that seem kind of dangerous?
Isn't it about time we took a\nbreak? My feet are killing me.
Maybe I overdid it a little...
Okay, let's do this!\nNo slacking!
All right, we're here!
All right! Looks like this place is safe.
Good, we made it to the safe room!
There might be a Shadow\nsomewhere 'round here. Don't get sloppy.
*groan* This door's locked\nfrom the other side.
Booyah! Mission accomplished.
Hey, what's that?
Heh! Hell yeah!
I got a hunch there's a secret passage around here somewhere.\n...Or not.
Nice! We made it this far!
Hey, this door won't open.
Oh? This is\u2014
See ya, get back safe.
That one sure looks tough...
Hey... Can't we take a break already?
I got careless...
All right, let's start today's job!
Looks like... this is our destination.
Ooh, a new safe room.
Okay! Let's take a break!
Hrm! Shadow spotted!
Huh? This door's locked\nfrom the other side...
All right! Our work is done!\nWe did good today.
Hmm? Something caught my eye...
Mewhehe! I love Treasure!
Hm? Could there be a secret\npath in this room?
Now then, what do we do from here?
Hrm, this door won't open...
Now, let's see what we got...
Good work today!
More strong enemies... Stay focused!
Everybody seems to be getting pretty tired...
This might get tricky.
Are you ready?\nIt's time for work. Let's go.
We're at our destination.
Hm, this area seems\nsound. Let's secure it as our safe room.
Phew, we can rest here.
Shadow ahead. Take caution.
Huh? It appears this door is locked.
That completes the job. Is everyone okay?
There might be something important here.\nWhy don't we look around?
Yes! Excellent find!
I'm feeling a breeze.\nThere could be a crack somewhere.
We've arrived. Let's go.
It's sealed shut. Let's find another route.
Oh? This is...
Well then, take care.
Stay alert.\nWe can't afford to underestimate them.
You okay? Maybe we should take\na little break.
*sigh* I grow weary.
Time for work. First steps are\nimportant, so stay focused.
This is where we were traveling to.
Hmm... we can use this space.
Shall we take a break here?
A Shadow is near. Take caution.
It's locked. Let's\nreturn to it later.
Job done and beautifully executed, too.
I've just realized\u2014that's quite valuable!
How stupendous!
Hm, is there a secret path around here?
We're here.\nWhat do we do next?
Hmph, it seems it doesn't open.\nSo be it.
No... Could this be...?
Well then, see you.
Looks like a tough one. Be careful.
I'm a bit tired...\nCan we rest over here?

Someone looks tired.
Oooh, there's a safe room.\nShould we take a rest?
Shadow detected. Several, actually. Be careful.
No Shadow readings.\nIt's relatively safe here.
That spot's fishy! Watch out!
There's a chest we haven't opened here.
Heh, piece of cake!
There! Getting a Treasure reading nearby!
Let's go.\nWe've got a lot of work ahead of us today.
Target reached!
Oooh, nice job.\nNothing beats a good day's work.
We're here.\nSo... what's next?
Hmmm... This room's suspicious.\nA hidden path, maybe?
It's locked! Maybe we\ncan open it from behind.
This one doesn't open.
There's a strong enemy around here!\nThey seem seriously tough... Be careful!
We've been exploring for a while...\nShould we take a break soon?
We've reached a good stopping\npoint. Should we regroup and\nreview our intel?
All right, we've gathered all the information in this area!
Whoa, we've got a lot of tickets!\nWe should be able to go to a new map.
We've found a secret area!
This is not looking good!
Got to get refocused...
This is our destination.
There's a safe room over there.
We won't be found by the enemy here.\nLet's get organized.
Enemy spotted. Let's proceed with caution.
It seems to be locked.
I'm glad we were able to finish things smoothly.
What's that...?
Whoa, look at that...
There's something strange about this room...
So, what's next?
It won't open... We shouldn't\ntry forcing it either.
What could be inside...?
We made it back safely.\nLet's do our best next time too!
That's a strong enemy... What should we do?
Don't overdo it.\nLet's take breaks as needed.
Perhaps I... miscalculated?
Proceed with caution.
Here we are. Now then...
There's a safe room. Perfect timing.
Let's take a break and reorganize.
It's an enemy! Be on your guard.
It's locked?
Mission complete.
According to my calculations,\nthere should be some quality\nitems nearby.
Not a bad outcome.
There must be a secret path somewhere...
So far, so good.
Seems it won't open.
Let's see...
Mission complete. Let's call it a day.
This enemy seems very strong.\nLet's be cautious.
We should rethink our strategy.
I may need to pace myself...
Is everyone ready?\nLet's go.
Here we are.
There's a safe room.\nLet's take a little rest.
What should we do next?
Shadows ahead. Proceed with caution.
This door is locked.\nCan we get in from the other side?
Mission complete!
It's a treasure chest. Let's open it!
Oh, this seems pretty good.
I hear wind... There might be a hidden passage nearby.
We're here. What's next, Wonder?
It doesn't look like we can get through here.
I wonder what's inside. Let's see!
Good work. Remember to cool down.
A strong enemy... Think we can handle it?
We should rest.\nBe careful not to put too much strain on your body.
No! The invincible hero,\nLeo Kamiyama, cannot fall yet!
Heroes assemble! Let's move out!
Oh? Is this our destination?
No enemy readings over there. Want to\ncheck it out?
Let's stop to recharge. Then\nwe'll continue our fight\nagainst evil.
An enemy! Let's hit them with all we've got!
Even heroes need to take a detour sometimes...\nLet's go find the key.
Nice! We did it!
Hero senses activate! There\nseems to be treasure nearby.
Just as I thought. Nailed it!
Hero senses tingling... There's a hidden passage around here.
I'm getting pumped! Let's go!
Dang, what the heck!?\nIt won't open!
It must be something that'll make me stronger, right?
Big haul today. Let's keep it up!
What an intimidating presence!\nMust be a formidable opponent.
Learning to stay\nwell-rested is also part\nof being a hero.
*sigh* I feel quite tired...
Now then, let's begin the infiltration.
So, this is our destination.
Ah, a safe room.
Say... why don't we rest a little?
Enemy ahead.
It seems to be locked.
So this completes our job?\nI see... Very interesting.
What is that?
Not a bad result!
This structure... There could be a hidden passage.
We've arrived. What do we do from here?
Hmm... Seems like we can't get in this way.
What's in here?
Well then, see you.
It seems to be a fairly strong opponent. Stay alert.
Setting the pace for the team\nis one of the leader's\nresponsiblities.
Are you guys exhausted, or is it just me?
Time to get goin'.
Are we here?
Should we take a short break?
I could use a rest.
There's a Shadow.
It won't open... Do we need a key for this?
Nice work!
Hey, shouldn't we get that?
Don't mind if I do!
Isn't there any way to get through?
Where are we...?
Nope... Doesn't look like it'll open.
What do we got here?
I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.
Looks like a tough one...
Pushin' yourself too hard is no good, you know?
I might not make it...
Let's stay focused!
Here we are! Let's be careful, okay?
There's a safe room. Want to take a break?
Let's go over our situation.
Enemy up ahead! Watch out!
It's locked...
Phew... Mission accomplished.
Look! I bet it's something good!
Now that's worth celebrating!
I think there's a passage nearby...
What should we do next?
It won't open...
I wonder what's inside.
That's it for today. Good job, everyone!
Oh no, a strong enemy...\nWhat should we do...?
Are you okay? Why don't we take a little break?
I'm not feeling so great...
Let's get going!
We're here!
There's an Oasis! Just kidding.
Phew. Wouldn't mind cooling off in a safe room.
Enemy spotted. We should probably be careful.
Is it locked?
Got it done!
I wanna know what's inside.
Wow, that's incredible!
I feel a breeze... Is there a hidden path there?
Whoa, we're already here!
Hmmm, it won't open.
What is it? Something good?
That was pretty fun! See you next time!
A Shadow... And it looks strong. We should proceed with caution.
I'm getting a bit thirsty.\nLet's go grab a drink!
Um... Is now a good time to heal?
I hope this can provide some fleeting amusement.
Is this the place?
You can't neglect your rest.
The chosen one's sanctuary... I mean, safe room.
A Sh-Shadow!?
It's locked...
I saw that one coming from miles away.
Hm? Is that the unmistakable aura of a rare item?
The chosen one will surely make the most of it.
I feel we are being guided by the unseen...
Is this our first time here?
It doesn't seem like we can open it...
Aren't you curious about what's inside?
If ever you need my power,\ncall upon me again.
I sense a formidable enemy approaching.\nIs it time to use... that power?
Even chosen ones need their rest.\nWhy don't we take a break?
I'm reaching my limit...
All right, let's get going!
This is the place.
Safe room!\nLooks like we can take a break here.
Phew! Now we can relax.
Shhh! There's a Shadow!
Uh, it's locked.
All done!
I smell treasure!
Makin' bank!
Is there a secret passage around here?
Here we are!
Hmmm, it won't open...
What's inside?
All right, let's go home.
It looks pretty strong...
They say that balancing work and rest gives twice the results with half the effort.\nIsn't it about time we rested yet?
Keep an eye on that HP and SP!
Hey, hey! I see a place where we can chill!
Whoa, it's Shadow City around here!
Woohoo, no enemies here! \u266a
Uhhh, this looks dicey.\nIs it a trap?
Treasure chest nearby! Check it! \u266a
Hm, maybe you'd better find a detour?
Look! Treasure! It's so shiny!
Let's get this party started!
Mission complete!\nBooyah!
Alrighty then, we're here!
Go, go, go!
Hmmm, gettin' some "secret passage" vibes here!
It's locked? How annoying!
Ugh. It's not opening!
What the what now!? That one looks strong, doesn't it?
You're not planning an all-nighter, are you?\nLet's take five!
Booyah! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Been there, done that... Shouldn't we move on?
We're absolutely rolling in tickets!\nWe should be able to go somewhere new.
Hm? I think there's something here.
Sorry, I'm a bit tired...\nCan we take a break?
Let's give it our best effort. Within reason, of course.
Well then...
Let's rest before we get too tired.
*sigh*\nIt's so comfortable, I don't wanna leave.
Here's our chance to strike first.
The door is locked.
I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.
Treasure chests are so exciting, aren't they?
This is very nice.
This room feels suspicious somehow.
We all deserve a nice long vacation.
Doesn't seem it'll open so easily...
I hope it's something good.
I'm a bit tired,\nbut it was an interesting experience.
I did the best I could, I suppose.
It looks really strong... Are we still going to fight it?
No need to push yourself so hard.\nEven phantom theives need a break... right?
We're still in danger. We should heal.
It's a safe room. Let's make use of it.
Shadows ahead.\nThere are quite a few, so let's proceed with caution.
There don't seem to be any\nshadows around. Let's keep\ngoing.
Something feels off. There might be a trap.
It looks like there's a treasure chest...\nI'll leave the decision to you, Wonder.
I see, an interesting lineup...
The Treasure is close...\nEveryone, are you ready?
Let's get exploring.\nEveryone, stay sharp.
This looks like our destination. What's next?
Mission accomplished. Good job, everyone.
Seems we've arrived. Where should we start?
I detect a hidden passage. Try to find it.
Looks like it's locked.
Seems it won't open... Let's find another way.
I've detected a strong enemy.\nStay vigilant.
Long periods of concentration are inefficient.\nHow about taking a break soon?
We did it. Let's keep up this momentum.
We've fully explored this area.\nGreat job.
We've accumulated quite a few tickets.\nShould we go redeem them soon?
Thought they could hide,\ndid they? Nothing escapes\nmy gaze.
Taking care of your health is important too, you know!
Oh, a safe room.\nWant to take a break?
That's a lot of enemies... Will we be okay?
It seems like there aren't too many enemies.
I have a bad feeling about this...\nIt's a trap! Everyone, be careful.
There's something good nearby.\nLet's try to find it!
Oh. What do we have here?
There's something super powerful ahead!\nWhat could it be?
Let's go!
Here we are! \nThis is the right place, isn't it?
Great job today!\nLet's work hard together next time too!
So, what's next from here?
There's a hidden passage here.\nNothing gets past Nemertes!
Looks like it's locked...
Huh? It won't open.
That one is definitely strong... What should we do?
Um, big bro...\nI think it's about time you took a break.
You're doing great, just so you know!
If the map says we're here, then it should be... Uh...
It looks like you've gathered a lot of tickets.
Nothing gets by me!
Oof, this might be bad...
Here we gooo! This is so exciting!
Goal!
We can rest over there!
Let's take it easy!
Shhh! We'll get caught!
It won't open without a key.
Exploring was fun!
Ooh, I bet there's treasure around here!
We found the treasure!
This room's pretty suspicious...
Whoa! So fast!
Why won't this door open?
I wonder what's inside!
That went well!
I want to come back and play again!
That enemy looks really strong!
If we don't rest soon,\nwe won't have energy to keep exploring.
This situation seems dire...
Now then, let us give it our all!
We've arrived. Now then...
Safe room!\nJust when we needed it, too.
Let's take a break.
It's a Shadow... What shall we do?
It's locked.\nIt seems we won't be able to open it from here.
Hard work equals bountiful harvest!
My intuition says\nthat there's treasure nearby!
Ah! It's just what I wanted!
There must be some way we can make progress...
Traesto! \u266a\nWe've arrived!
It's shut tight. Shall we take another route?
I sense a most excellent harvest!
Simple as that!
Let's call it a day!
Oh?\nI feel a very unpleasant presence.
I'm exhausted!\nI request a short break, please!
I... can't move...
Hope it's something good!
Here.
Safe room! Should we rest a bit?
Let's take a break. We should mind our health.
The enemy... Be careful.
It's locked...\nLet's try and figure out\nhow to get it open.
Great job, everyone!\nNo one twisted their ankle,\nright?
Seems like there's\nsomething good nearby...\nLet's look for it together!
Yep, this is pretty good!\nThis should help everyone out.
It looks like there may be another path.
Made it safe and sound.
We can't get through here? Let's try somewhere else.
I really hope it's something good!
All finished!
I'm glad we made it back\nsafely! Nice work, everyone.
That one looks difficult! Don't push yourself too hard.
It's great you're working\nhard, but don't forget to take\n a break, okay?
Granny's not as spry as she used to be.
Let's search every nook and cranny.
We've made it. This is the place, right?
This is a safe room, right?\nLet an old gal get her rest.
Phew. This is too much at my age.
There's an enemy here... let's rush 'em!
Can't we just kick it open?
Well done indeed! Very nice work.
Looks like treasure ahead!
It's our lucky day, young man!
Oh? Isn't this a passage?
Oh, we're already here? How convenient!
Looks like it might be a good idea to call it here...
Wonder if something good's in there...
Nice job, you worked pretty hard today!
It seems this is as far as we can go for now.
It's normal to hit a few\nwalls while you're young...\nBut I won't lose.
Glad to see you're energetic,\nbut keep your elders in mind\nand give us a break, would you?
Sorry... I think I'd like to rest a little...
I wonder what'll happen today. I can't wait!
Hehehehe... We've arrived.
Look, a safe room.
Phew... This place is pretty chill.
A Shadow... Wonder, be careful.
Hmmm... looks like it's locked.
What an adventure, huh?
Hey, a treasure chest!
Wow, didn't know this was here...
Hear that whooshing sound? Is there a secret passage?
Here, right? This is our destination?
Guess we gotta go the long way...
Find anything good?
Mission complete! Good work.
Well, I guess that's it for today.
That one looks pretty strong...
Aren't you pushing yourself\ntoo hard? It might be good\nidea to take a rest.

Is this... a trap? Better be careful, Wonder.
I sense treasure! Should we look around?
Amazing, Wonder! You're a genius!
Okay! Where are we off to today?
And here we are.
I think that's enough for\ntoday. All in moderation,\nright?
What a thrill, huh?
Think there might be a hidden passage over there?
Huh? Is it locked?
Opeeeen sesame!\n...No luck, huh?
Wow, that enemy looks tough.\nOn your cue, Wonder.

Oh no... I'm going\nto be punished by\nKiuchi-sama...
Next time, I'll\nget you...
To think they\ncould escape...
You coward.
You're quick!
We must protect\nthis place...
I'm so bored...
I'm feeling energized!\nHaha!
Got to focus...
I wanna be like\nKiuchi-sama...
It's quiet today...
I wanna be\na starter...
I've gotta work hard,\nand make it onto\nthe starting lineup...
Someone's there...\nam I seeing things?
The enemy... Where\ndid they go?
Huh? What was that?
Someone! Quick!
That's not\nKiuchi-sama!?
Intruders!
They're after\nKiuchi-sama!
This area's limited to\nauthorized personnel only!
They're Kiuchi-sama's\nhaters! Stop them!
Let's get outta here!
Don't run!
I'll chase you\nwherever you go!
Kiuchi-sama's going\nto hate me...
I lost them...
It got away...
Next time\nI'll get them for sure!
S-So fast...
We must support\nKiuchi-sama!
I'm a big fan of\nKiuchi-sama.
I need to maintain\nthis figure...
I'm devoted to\nKiuchi-sama!
Kiuchi-sama, why didn't\nyou call me...
Gamepad Cursor Mode set to On
Gamepad Cursor Mode set to Off
Nothing to report\nover here!
I want to be\nKiuchi-sama's favorite...
I wonder if there's\nanything fun to do...
For Kiuchi-sama!
I wonder if I'll see\nKiuchi-sama today.
Intruders?
Some pesky little mice\nhave snuck their way\ninside, have they?
Is someone there...?
How could they have\nmade it this far...?
You a fan of\nKiuchi-sama?
I'm kicking you\noutta here!
I won't let you escape!
This is no place\nfor outsiders!
I'll kill you! I swear\nI'll kill you!
Don't run. Fight me!
Tch, they got away...
If only I were\nstronger...
Next time...
I need to report this\nto Kiuchi-sama.
Coward...
Kiuchi-sama is\ncounting on me!
No one gets by me!
I'm the strongest\ncatcher in the game!
No one's getting\npast me!
I'll catch anything you\nthrow at me.\nBring it on!
Thought I saw someone\nsuspicious around here...
I cannot betray\nKiuchi-sama's trust...
Another day, another\nlively patrol.
I need to work\nharder next time...
I wanna see Kiuchi-sama\nplay with my\nown eyes...
For Kiuchi-sama, I will\nprotect this place\nwith my life...
No matter the opponent,\nI'll fight with all\nmy might...
I wish I could play\nwith Kiuchi-sama...
I've got a bad feeling...
It's quiet...\nToo quiet...
Who are you!?
What was that!?
Who is that!?
Intruders!
Stop!
Wait!
Don't run!
Get them!\nCapture them!
Freeze!
I won't let you escape!
Next time, I'll\nget you...
I was careless.
That's a slippery one...
I saw your face!
They disappeared?\nImpossible...
Suspicious!
I must fulfill my duty!
Never let your\nguard down.
Must... protect...\ndoor...
It's quiet...
No slacking off.
Don't lose your edge!
Seems there's\nno one here...
What is that...?
Nothing to report...
Who's there?
Suspect spotted!
Halt! Who're you?
Intruders! Stay alert!
Get the intruders!
Stop right there!
It's the enemy!\nSeize them!
Intruders! Hurry!
After them!
I won't let you go!
Can't believe I\nlost them...
I blew it...
Damn, they're quick...
Gone... I'm pathetic...
...T-They vanished!?
I just checked\nover there.
Is someone behind me...?
My weapon needs\nmaintenance...
It's too quiet.
Better safe than sorry!
I won't let you petty\nthieves escape!
We need to hold\nour position.
I heard something...
We need to protect\nthis place...
I'm ready to fight!
Enemies! Get them!
Are you challenging me?
Enemy spotted.\nPrepare to engage.
You won't make it\nout alive!
Feel the wrath of\nthe samurai!
No one can escape\nfrom my blade!
Nowhere to run!
Stop!
Where are you going!?
Don't run away,\ncowards!
Sorry, I lost sight\nof them...
Lost sight of them...
I'll never give up!
How humiliating...
Next time, I'll get\nthem for sure!
No one shall pass!
Miyazawa-sama's\ncounting on me...
It is my sworn duty to\nprotect this place!
If you want to pass,\nyou'll have to go\nthrough me!
Do you really think\nyou can beat me?
I am the guardian of\nthis castle.
Never let your guard\ndown for even a\nmoment!
Strengthen our defenses!
As long as Miyazawa-sama\nis here, we're safe!
In the name of\nMiyazawa-sama,\nI will ascend!
I thought I saw\nsomething...
I pledge my loyalty\nto Miyazawa-sama...
The enemy's fate\nis death.
This is all for\nMiyazawa-sama...
My will is as immovable\nas the mountains!
Wh-Who goes there!?
You! Who are you!?
Hey! What are you\ndoing here!?
You look suspicious!\nWho are you!?
You look suspicious!\nIntruders...!?
I won't let you go!
Thieves! Stop\nright there!
Thieves!\nI'll capture you!
Thieves! You won't\nget away!
You rats! Stop\nscurrying around!
Ugh! I lost sight\nof them...
Tch! They got away...
You're quick!
They disappeared!?
Damn, where did\nyou go!?
These slaves...\nI can't bear to see them\nsuffer like this.
I'm gonna get promoted and have my own\ncastle someday!
I-I'll punch you to death!\nI'll kill you with my sword!
Not even a tiny cat\nwill get through me, as long as I live...
Wait, is this the right patrol\nroute...? Eh, it's fine.
I'll hurt them... and no\none is allowed to complain.
Feels like I'm being\nwatched... Nah, no way.
When I get promoted...\nI'll wear golden armorand push people around...
I'm not scared, 'cause I am strong! Does not\nmatter who comes along!
You're all idiots\nfor defying the king...
Hmm!? Intruder!
Who is that!? Intruder!
Who is that? What are you doing!?
Intruders! Intruders\nover here!
Hey! Stop!
Intruders! Don't let\nthem escape!\nAfter them!
Freeze! You won't get\naway from me!
Intruders! Get them!
Don't run! Stop them!
Damn it! Where did\nthey go...?
Where is he, dammit!?
Lost sight of them...
Huh!? They're gone...\nHow?
Ah! No! I messed up! That's not it! Damn it!
You're there, right!?\nI can see you! ...Just kidding.

You bastards!\nYou can't escape!
You! I won't let you\nescape! Intruders!\nSurround them!
Lost sight of them...\nWhere are you hiding?\nCome out!
Damn! Did I lose them?
They ran away so fast...\nWhere did they go?
They should still be\naround here! I'll\nfind them...
He vanished!? Is he\na magician!?
There's no one here.\nWhat am I supposed to\nbe monitoring?
Can anyone really\nbreak in here in\nthe first place?
*sigh* Can't we get\nmore help around here?\nI want a break...
How long do we\nhave to guard this\ngodforsaken place?
I just want to punch\nsomething... A thief or a brat,\nanything will do...
Is someone there!?\nBring it on!
No one over here!\nNo one over there\neither!
Defying our ruler...\nThey are truly foolish!
Get over here, you\nfools! I'll smash\nya skulls open!
All okay here...\nShould I\ncheck again?
I'm so bored... I\nwonder if anyone\nwill come...
Hey! Come on out!\nI'm not gonna hurt\nyou... Ahaha!
Intruders?
No outsiders allowed!
The hell you doing here!?
Someone's coming...
What was that noise...?
This isn't a\nplace for kids!
Eliminating the\nintruders!
Wait!
Do as I say!
I'm gonna show you\na world of pain!
Tch... they're\nquite fast...
You damn brats...
Crap... I lost them...
Damn it... Where did\nthey go...?
We need to hurry\nand find them...
Efficiency comes\nfirst, safety second.
If we don't do good\njob today...
I want to take a\nbreak soon...
There's no electrcity\nleakage...
The next place to\ncheck should be...
Let's check out\nthis area...
It's so humid...
Prioritize energy saving,\nprioritize efficiency...
I'm just about through\nwith this job...
Another exhausting\nday...
Wait, what\nwas that...?
Is there a\npower leak?
Hmm? Who are you?
What was that...?
Weaseled in,\nhave they...?
Trespassers! Get out!
Alert! Alert!\nIntruders detected!
Stop! You filthy\nrodents!
Don't you dare\ninterrupt my work!
I'm kickin' you\noutta here!
Where the hell did\nthey go...?
They got away...\nThis is bad...
I won't let you\nslip away...!
Good at hiding,\nI'll give them\nthat...
Let's just pretend\nwe never saw it...
Another repair...?\nWhat a pain.
Need to be careful\nwith repairs here...
It shouldn't need\nrepairs or anything...
Let's see...
It's so humid\neverywhere...
It looks like it could\ncollapse around here\nat any time...
We did a pretty good\njob today, huh?
It's okay to slack\noff just a little...\nRight?
Too much work...
I don't wanna do\nanything that's gonna\nget us killed...
You're outsiders...\nAren't you!?
To think they'd make\nit this far in...!
Get out, trespassers!
What are you\ndoing here?
How did you get\nin here!?
You shall not interfere\nwith our work!
I'm going to get you!
Don't think you can\nget away!
Stop, you damn brats!
I'm throwing you outta\nhere right now!
When I catch them,\nI'm throwing them\nin the dam...
Crap... If the boss\nfinds out they\nescaped...
You won't escape\nnext time...
Damn it, what did\nmy subordinates do?
Cowards...
Intruders will not\nbe tolerated!
Who are you? Leave\nthis place at once!
This isn't a place\nfor you lot!
No permission,\nno access!
I'm going to\ncatch every last\none of you!
I doubt there's anyone\nslacking off...
Don't go slacking\noff now!
Work! Work! Work!
It's hard having such\nuseless subordinates...
Always be efficient in\nwhatever you do!
Wh\u2014Who are you!?
Found a weird one!
S-Stop! Thief!
Show yourself,\ntomb robber!
Hrrrgh... Where'd\nyou go?
*gasp* They vanished!
Hrrrgh... Protect.\nI will protect this...
Someone passes,\nI get scolded...\nMust, protect...
He. Is here. Danger...\nMust. Find...
No-good grave robber...\nFind him and bury him...
I will protect this...\nIt's my job...
This, important...\nImportant, I protect...
I'll curse you...
Get out... Get out...
Swift is heaven's\nvengeance...
Wahhh... The outside world\nis scary... Too scary...

Looking forward to it! Let's do this!

A surprise attack!?\nLet's get back in formation!
Everyone, be careful.
That was careless. Let's wrap this up, quickly.
Spotted a strong enemy. Everyone, be careful.
It's a rare enemy... Don't let it escape!
It can't be... Why...!?
No...!
They're down...? Quick, someone help them!
Please complete the prerequisite story first.

The situation is dire. Heal quickly.
This is bad... Someone cover them!
I got careless... Focus on healing!
Don't panic...! Use your head!
Knocked down!? This is bad...
An ally's down! Quick, help them back up!
Good call.
Multiple enemies eliminated! What a wonderful display.
You annihilated them in one fell swoop! Not too shabby.
Multiple targets eliminated... Impressive.
Amazing as always, Wonder. All enemies eliminated.
Excellent hit, Wonder!
You have already sent a reminder to your friend today. You can send another reminder tomorrow.
Just as planned!
Enemy down, now's your chance!
They're off balance. Nicely done.
And now for a critical hit!
They caught on!?
Everybody, get out of there as fast as you can!
When you see a chance to strike, don't let it pass!
The time is upon us! Now!
Behold! This is our power!
Everyone okay? Good work.
A good battle. Let's keep it up.
You're not doing so hot... don't overdo it.
A nasty state... Seek help, ASAP.
Spiritual effects... Stay focused.
This is a bad situation... Let's approach this calmly and make a plan.
Our teammate's back up! Time for a counterattack!
Wonder's back in action.\nPhew, I was getting worried...
Preparations complete. On your signal, Wonder.
Ready when you are!
The plum blossoms are blooming now!
Leader's down!\nEverybody, try to stay calm.
Wonder...! We're in a tough spot.
Everyone, protect Wonder!
Highlight, ready to activate!
Time to go wild.
Ready to show your stuff?
Are you okay? This is no time to let our guard down.
Looks like you're okay. Welcome home.
Decided to come back? Good call.

I'll do you proud.
Understood.
I got you.
Not a bad idea.
You did well to choose me.
Heh! Let's do this!
Stay alert.
All right... Time to go to work?
Increased preparedness for our departure would surely serve us well.
Let's take 'em down!
Retreat is also\na valid strategy...
All right, I'll head back.
What a pity... and with only one step away.
I see... A tactical retreat...
So there are other things we should prioritize?
Please complete the mission Summer Days - Head to Shirosato Beach to unlock Shirosato Beach.
Not bad.
I've returned. What's the next mission?
As expected.
Finished!
Log uploaded.
The harvest and the sense of accomplishment... Those are the real fruits of labor.

Please complete the prerequisite story first.
Nice choice!
Leave it to me!
I'll show you what I can do!
All right, I'm all warmed up!
You can reupload your log after 10 minutes. Please wait.
Can't afford to get careless, right?
Let's gooo!
Let's get ready.
Okay! Off I go!
I'll give it my all!
Shall we head back for now?
I'm sweating...
Heading back now? Hm... Okay then.
Are you going to end it halfway through?
Giving up halfway is so frustrating...
It's settled!
Game set!
Big catch!
Use adjustment next time.
I did the thing!
I've got this!
Closer, ready to go!
You talking about beach volleyball?\n...Is that a no?
All right, just leave this to me!
Let's make this the best summer ever!
Ready! Here I go!
Let's go!
All right! I got this!
Let's have ourselves a blast!
AAAAAA==
Aww, but I was having fun...!
Let's run that one again!
Time to take a breather!
Got it. I'll be right back!
Huh? Are you returning already?
Yeah, perfect!
Good to see you!
That was a breeze!
Nice! Found a treasure!
That was a bit of a hard fight!
Leave it to me.
Got it. I'll take care of it.
New job needs doing? Leave it to me.
You want me to join?
Now? All right, I can jump in.
Got it.
Let's go.
Okay, let's go.
All right, let's give it our all.
Sure am hungry...
Damn! That's embarrassing!
*gasp*... I'm exhausted...
I did a little prep... but it's still not enough.
Pushing yourself too hard is bad for your health, you know?
Let's think about what to do when we get back.
Nice work!
How's it going?
Haha!
What do you think? Good, right?
Man... that was pretty rough, huh?
Preparations complete. On your signal, Wonder.
Ready when you are!
My turn.
I am indeed ready.
It seems you need my power.
Exploration start. Keep on your toes, everyone.
Wind, out.
I suppose we should get serious, then.
Everyone, be careful.
It's my turn. Very well.
In other words... there are other priorities?
It's not over yet...\nAre you sure?
I see... I'll return immediately.
Reworking the plan? All right, then.
To end so prematurely... that's regrettable.
Everyone okay? Good work.
Mission accomplished. Good job, everyone.
All right... We did it.
Heheh... Mission accomplished.
My role is complete. I will leave the rest to you.
It's been left to me!
Is there anything I can do?
I'm with you.
I-I'll do my best!
What should we do next?
Let's stay focused.
Okay.
I'll do my best to keep up.
Got it! I'm off!
Look forward to it.
That's it for today. Good job, everyone.
OK, got it. I'll be right back.
You mean... there are other things to do?
Do you want to quit here?
Got it! I trust your judgment.
We did it.
Looks like a good harvest.
Not bad at all!
Phew... Mission accomplished.
This is great!
Do you... ever think about me?
I trust you.
Shift confirmed!
I'll serve up a full course!
Let's make this a summer to remember!
Let's get going!
I'll go!
Here I come!
It's hot, but let's keep trying our best!
It's been a while since I've had a summer break this fun.
I'm okay. I'll return soon.
All right, if you say so.
I wanted to keep going until the end...
What? It's not over yet though...
You're saying... it's okay to end it right here?
Got it done!
That was pretty fun! See you next time!
That was an easy win!
I'm really tired!
*giggle* We accomplished a lot today.
There is no need to fear.
I won't betray your expectations!
My pleasure.
I'll do my best.
I'm not going to let you down.
Got to get refocused!
I'll give it my best shot.
Leave it to me!
Understood. I'll give it my all.
Leave it to me.
I'm getting a bit tired. Let's take a break.
What a shame.
So it goes... Understood.
...So you're saying that I should give up halfway through?
Understood. I am on the way.
I'm glad we were able to finish things smoothly.
So, we made it back in one\npiece. The next mission will\nbe a breeze.
A fair reward for the work.
This is the result of everyone's hard work!
Stay humble in the face of victory.
All prepped. We can go at any time.
My turn.
You need my power?
Looks like this is where I come in.
Everything's ready to go.
Let's all give it our best.
Is everyone ready? Let's go.
Peak Condition!
I think I can do it.
I'll never let you down!
But I'm still not done yet...
No way... we're going back now?
Now that it's come to this... I feel a bit regretful.
Next time, I'll keep going until the end.
Very well. I will return immediately.
Mission complete!
Oh, this seems pretty good.
Here are your results.
Good job. Remember to do a cooldown.
I sealed the deal, huh?
Did someone call for a hero?
Leave it to me.
I am at your command!
Is it my turn now?
Good choice!
Let's go, people!
Heroes assemble! Let's move out!
I'm getting excited! Let's go!
I've got your back!
I was getting restless.
Let's stop to recharge.\nThen we'll continue\nour fight against evil.
Heroes don't give up that easily!
Hmmm, that's unfortunate... However, I do understand.
Understood. But, please explain your reasons later.
Understood. But, please explain your reasons later.
Justice... will prevail!
Nice! We did it!
Now, let's take stock of our spoils!
Big haul today. Let's keep it up!
Justice will prevail!
Leave it to me.
Preparations are in order. Ready to go whenever!
You made the right choice.
You've got quite the discerning eye.
I'll help you out.
Understood. Proceeding as planned.
My turn!
Understood. I shall proceed with caution.
This job should be pretty easy.
I have no objections. I shall do as instructed.
We need to change our strategy.
Abandoning mission. I'll await your next orders.
We should rethink our strategy.
Is it really okay to stop here?
...Did I really make the right choice?
Mission complete.
Not a bad outcome.
We really outdid ourselves.
Mission complete. Let's call it a day.
Well done.
Ready to roll!

A Gal's grand debut!
Leave the support to me!
You've got pretty good taste!
Time for me to show off!
Let's raise the roof!
Let's get started!
Go, go, go!
Showtime!
Woohoo, it's time to\nparty all night!
Totally wack! Let's bounce!
No way... We screwed up...\nSeriously?
Uh... isn't this, like, super bad?
Shouldn't we head back now? Like, seriously?
What? This is such a bummer.
Mission complete! Let's celebrate!
Booyah! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Haha! That's so totally crazy!
Nice one, guys! Mad props.
Most excellent!
Nice choice.
Me... Yeah, looks like its on me.
Here I go.
Am I up? Works for me.
Key... Ready to go!
I'm here! It'll all be okay!
The chosen one... attacks!
Key... here we gooo!
Hope this can cure my boredom.
I can see it now... Victory is in sight!
You can't neglect your rest.
As for this next mission... uhh, no comment.
This is a tactical retreat... I think...
Even if you tell me to come back all of the sudden...!
This, too, is the fate\nof a chosen one, isn't it...
I knew it had to be this way
The chosen one will surely make the most of it.
I haven't even gotten\nstarted yet.
If you need my power,\ncall on me again.
It seems I truly am the chosen one, after all!
Guess it's my turn.
Perhaps I should show you my mature side once in a while.
The pen is mightier than the sword, you know.
I'll keep doing my best.
It seems I was able to live up to everyone's expectations...
It's a bit of a hassle... but I guess there's no other option.
Let's do our best without pushing ourselves too hard.
Ahh, what a beautiful day. It's the perfect weather for fishing.
I'll treat it like a research trip.
Maybe I should show my motivated side now and again.
No matter the situation, always keep a clear mind.
I did the best I could, I suppose.
Let's rest before we get too tired.
Canceled. Well, I guess that's how it goes sometimes.
I think it'd go well, but... Okay, I'll go back and rest.
All thanks to everyone.
It might be nice to go on a trip once in a while.
I'm a bit tired,\nbut it was an interesting\nexperience.
This is very nice.
I wonder if this means I won't have to work for a while.
Just leave it to me!
Now it's my turn!
It's my time to shine!
I'm gonna bust some heads!
I've been waiting for this!
All right, let's get going!
I'm not some paper tiger, okay?
Well then, let's start.
Okay! Let's go!
Heheh! I handled that easily!
What? But we're still on the way...
Huh? We're going back right now!?
I wanna keep going till the end next time!
These... don't seem to be fully burned...
What? That's...
Makin' bank!
Whoa, this is quite the bounty!
All right, let's go home.
All done!
Wow! This is great!
It's the best choice!
Just leave it to me\u266a
My batteries are fully charged!
It would be preposterous\nto leave me behind!
Leave it to Bui!
I'm taking you down!
Let's get going!
My excitement is growing!
Would you like to change your preferences?
I'll live up to your expectations!
We made it back! Should we take a break?
Is it okay to leave it unfinished?
Canceled!? What's going on here!?
I request an explanation...
We haven't even finished sowing the seeds...
Easy-peasy.
A natural result... An insult is in order!
Ah! It's just what I wanted!
Wonderful!
Let's call it a day!
Leave it to me.
Time for Riddle!
I'll do my best!
Should I be getting this hyped!?
Exploration team, go!
Ready?
I'll give it my all!
Here we go! This is so exciting!
Now what's happening!?
I'm so pumped!
All right, I'll take it easy for a bit then!
Can we go back?
Over already? Why?
I want to come back and play again!
Aww, I wanted to play more...
That was too easy!
That went well!
Exploring was fun!
Did I do a good job?
Wow, amazing!
I got this!
All ready!
Marian, ready to go!
Leave the healing to me!
I'll do my best, you just watch!
Hope it's something good!
Let me heal you!
I will protect everyone...!
I can fight too.
I'll go above and beyond!
I'm sorry... If only I could've done a little better...
Okay! I'll go back now then.
What!?
I think I'm a bit tired...
Huh? We're only halfway but... Is it okay?
All finished!
Yep, this is pretty good!\nThis should help everyone out.
Great job, everyone!\nNo one twisted their ankle,\nright?
I'm glad we made it\nback safely! Everyone did\na great job.
Hehehe! That went well!
I heard your call!
Hah, now it's my time to shine!
You'd do well to listen to your elders, eh?
You got good taste, kid!
And they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Let's search every nook and cranny.
Let me show you what this granny can do!
Well done indeed! Very nice work.
Leave it to granny!
It's that easy!
It seems this is as far as we can go for now.
Phew. This is too much at my age.
Guess I'm getting older...
How disappointing.
I wanted to see it through till the end...
Wonder if something good's in there...
It's our lucky day, young man!
Well done, everybody. We fought well.
Nicely done. Grandma's happy!
A piece of cake, even for a granny like me!
You can leave this to me.
Looking forward to it! Let's do this!
Okay. I'll be counting on you.
Let's give it our all.
I look forward to working with you all!
Let the show begin!
I'll make it the best show ever.
Okay! Where are we off to today?
What a thrill, huh?
Okie! Let's move out!
I think that's enough\nfor today. All in moderation,\nright?
Eh? Come back...? What's up?
Stopping here? But that's...
I don't want to up and give up right in the middle, but... I guess there's no other way.
Sorry...
A toast to our victory!\nCheers!
Wasn't that the best show ever? Hehe.
Yaaay!
With this, our mission is complete!
Aren't you glad you relied on me?
Leave it all to me!
Hey there! What can I do for you?
Okay! Let's do this!
I'll do my best to support you!
I'm kind of nervous all of a sudden... No, you've got this, Miyu!
Ladies and gentlemen, let the show begin!
Let's go!
Let's get serious!
Leave it to me!
And that should do it. Mission accomplished.
I'm sorry... I wasn't strong enough...
Uh, th-that's all!\nEveryone tried really hard!
If only I had finished up a little faster...
Big bro, I'm sorry. I'll be back...
Next time, we'll finish this...
Let's do it!
Great job today!\nLet's work hard together next time too!
Hehehe.
I did my best! What did you think, big bro?
Yay! This is fun!
I'm all set!
Here I come!
Um... I look forward to working with you today...
Let's put on a good performance.
I'm up... Please don't get nervous...
From now on, leave it all to me!
I wonder what'll happen today. I can't wait!
All right, I'm off.
Time to start the show.
Stay tuned. Just you wait.
Well, I guess that's it for today.
I-I'm sorry!
But... it's not even over yet...
Huh? You want to retreat?
How the...?
A good experience. Nicely done.
Mission complete! Good work.

End of the line.
It's all ours.
Good find.
Mewhehehee!
Cower before the Phantom Thieves!
I've got this.
Purr-haps it's my time?
Looks like this is where I come in!
Behold my fur-someness!
All right, let's do this!
I'll be the ground to your feet!
Come on, let's teach them a lesson!
All right, let's start today's job!
I messed up!
No\u2014!
Damn! They're tough!
AAAAAA==
Mrow!?
Now, let's see what we got...
Nice! We made out pretty well!
Good work today!

Now it's really heating up!
That one's on me...
For real!?
Aaagh!
Damn... We're done for...
I'm sorry...
It's over!
Booyah! Mission accomplished.
We made an absolute killing!
BANG!
Woo-hoo!
Got it! I'll take this guy down!
You can count on me!
My turn? I'm always ready to go!
Huh? You called?
Okay! Leave it to me!
I won't hold back!
Go all in!
I need to let loose!
Finally, some action!
No!
No way!?
What the hell...? I can't believe this...
You're kidding, right!?
How could this happen?
We knocked it out of the park, huh?
Phew, job's done.
Finder's keepers!
Good work.
Heheh, that was easy!
I got this!
Got it!
I won't let you down.
Hmm... Intriguing.
This could make for some good inspiration.
Preparations complete.
Let the battle begin!
My blade is ready!
You got it.
Let's take 'em down.
What!?
I was careless.
A shame.
Until next time.
No artist is made in a day!
Another step closer to achieving my dreams.
Simply breathtaking.
Job done and beautifully executed, too.
Yes, pitch perfect.
Looks stupendous!
How stupendous!
Here I go!
Take on the challenge.
You need my power.
Just say the word.
I've got you covered.
Queen is good as golden.
This one's got my name on it.
Let's finish them in one fell swoop!
My fists are dying to punch something!
Seriously...?
