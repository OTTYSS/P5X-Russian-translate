That day... I was late getting home that night. I witnessed a drunken man aggressively harassing a woman.\nI couldn't just ignore it, so I stepped in to stop him. However\u2014\n"Damn brat... I'll sue!" | Even though I did what was right, I was forced to leave my hometown and move to Tokyo by myself. Did I do something wrong after all...?
I arrived at Caf\xe9 Leblanc.\nAs I opened the door, there was a pleasnt ding from a bell.\nThe owner of Leblanc slowly stood up and introduced himself as Sojiro Sakura. | Sojiro is my guardian while I'm in Tokyo. For the next year, until my "probation" is lifted, I will be living on the second floor of this shop. | And for that year, I will be attending Shujin Academy. Sojiro Sakura warned me, "If you cause any trouble, you'll be sent to juvenile hall."
As the female student entered the car,\nonly a vulgar boy remained...\n"Dammit... Screw that pervy teacher!"\n"Who does he think he is\u2014the king of a castle?"\nIt looks like he's a Shujin Academy student too.\nIt also seems like he has a lot going on right now. | "This rain ain't too bad. We better hurry up, or we'll be late." Despite his appearance, he seems like a good guy. I started heading toward the school with him...

That day, even though I did what thought was right...\nI was sued and forced to move to Tokyo...
The owner of the caf\xe9 is called Sojiro Sakura.\nI will be staying here for the next year.
While we were walking to school...\nSomething strange happened.
On the first day of school, it rained heavily.\nSeeking shelter from the rain, I ended up beside another student...
A castle appeared right before our eyes.\nIs this really the school?
